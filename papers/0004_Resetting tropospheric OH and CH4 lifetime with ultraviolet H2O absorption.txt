Title: Resetting tropospheric OH and CH4 lifetime with ultraviolet H2O absorption

Abstract:
The decay of methyl chloroform, a banned ozone-depleting substance, has provided a clear observational metric of mean tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) abundance. Almost all current global chemistry models calculate about 15% too much OH and thus too rapid methane loss. Methane is a short-lived climate forcer, critical to achieving global warming targets, and this error affects our model projections of climate change. New observations of water vapor absorption in the ultraviolet region (290 to 350 nanometers) imply reductions in sunlight with key photolysis rates decreasing by 8 to 12% in the near-surface tropical atmosphere. Incorporation of this new mechanism in a chemistry-transport model reduces OH and methane loss by only 4%, but combined with other proposed mechanisms, such as tropospheric halogen chemistry (7%), we may be able to resolve this conundrum. Editor’s summary Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, so understanding its atmospheric chemistry is essential for the development of models to successfully project climate change. Current models uniformly underestimate the atmospheric lifetime of methane because they uniformly overestimate how much hydroxyl radical (OH), the chemical species responsible for most of the destruction of methane, the atmosphere contains. Prather and Zhu investigated the cause of this discrepancy and report that it is due in part to a previously unrecognized pathway of water vapor absorption in the ultraviolet that causes models to calculate OH concentrations that are too high and thus methane lifetimes that are too short. —Jesse Smith
