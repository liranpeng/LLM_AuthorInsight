Title: The Vertical Structure of Tropical Temperature Change in Global Storm‐Resolving Model Simulations of Climate Change

Abstract:
Global storm‐resolving model (GSRM) simulations (kilometer‐scale horizontal resolution) of the atmosphere can capture the interaction between the scales of deep cumulus convection and the large‐scale dynamics and thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere. Here, we assess the vertical structure of tropical temperature change in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's GSRM X‐SHiELD, perturbed by a uniform sea surface temperature (SST) warming and/or increased CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ concentration. The simulated warming from an SST increase is weakly amplified relative to the surface through the mid‐troposphere before increasing to a factor of about 2.5 in the upper troposphere. This combination of muted warming in the mid‐troposphere and amplified warming aloft is within the range of CMIP6 models at individual pressure levels but, taken together, is distinctive behavior. The response to CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ increase with unchanged SST is an approximately vertically uniform warming, comparable to CMIP6 models, and is linearly additive with the SST‐induced warming in X‐SHiELD.
