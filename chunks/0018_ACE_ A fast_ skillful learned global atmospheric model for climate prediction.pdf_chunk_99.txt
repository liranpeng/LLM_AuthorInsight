temperature in the stratosphere. This is also the case for other stratospheric variables T1, v0, u0, qT
0
and qT
1 (not shown). Given that stratospheric dynamics are typically slower than variability in the
troposphere, it is not a surprise that overfitting is a particular concern in the uppermost model layers.
Interestingly, ML-based weather prediction systems have reported relatively poor performance in the
stratosphere (e.g. Fig. 2 of [13]).
