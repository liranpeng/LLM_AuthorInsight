be used with caution, although the central Paciﬁc PDs look
similar across the four deployments and should provide a ro-
bust statistic on the NOx distributions in the 0–12 km altitude
range. For CO, O3, and RHw, we ﬁnd that the central Paciﬁc
and tropical Atlantic PDs are stable across deployments and
should present an excellent observational climatology met-
ric for the models. The eastern Paciﬁc PDs vary greatly with
deployment and do not represent a stable climatology.
