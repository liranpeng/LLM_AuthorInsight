tant climate feedbacks on both fast and slow timescales. The
amount of water vapor in the air increases with temperature,
which is an amplifying feedback because water vapor is a
very effective greenhouse gas; this is a “fast” feedback, be-
cause water vapor amount in the air adjusts within days to
temperature change. The area covered by glaciers and ice
sheets is a prime “slow” feedback; it, too, is an amplifying
feedback, because the darker surface exposed by melting ice
