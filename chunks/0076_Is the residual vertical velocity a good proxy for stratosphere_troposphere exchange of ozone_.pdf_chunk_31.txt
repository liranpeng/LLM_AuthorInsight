itude tropopause varies seasonally by 50 ppb or more. To test the sensitivity to the tropopause location, we
also calculate STE O3 ﬂuxes across O3 isosurfaces of 120 ppb and 250 ppb.
The second-order moments advection scheme [Prather, 1986] calculates tracer ﬂuxes across the six surfaces
of each CTM grid box. Fluxes are accumulated when they cross a grid box surface that lies on the isosur-
face. Thus, we compute O3 ﬂuxes directly into and out of the LMS for each time step, deﬁning the LMS
