largely on models of unknown reliability in the 1980s. This was
followed by long-term climate-scale observations that have pro-
vided temperature records along with sea-level and cryospheric
changes. This is contradicted by the fact that the global tempera-
ture of surface air has remained essentially the same since 2001
(NASA, 2013).
