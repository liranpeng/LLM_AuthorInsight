and ozone precursors). “Hist” means the concentrations or emissions should evolve as for the CMIP6 historical simulation; a year means the
concentrations or emissions should be ﬁxed to that year. Note that the N2O and HC runs will have a small forcing, but will provide valuable
information on their historical impacts on stratospheric ozone changes.
