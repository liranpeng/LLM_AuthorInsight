for gridding the air quality station observations so that di-
rect comparison with global atmospheric chemistry mod-
els can be made. We then examine climatologies of sur-
face ozone (percentiles, seasonality, probability distributions,
AQX episodes) based on the observations and use them to
test a chemistry-transport model (UCI CTM) run in hindcast
mode, attempting to simulate each day’s MDA8 O3 concen-
trations for the years 2005–2006. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that
