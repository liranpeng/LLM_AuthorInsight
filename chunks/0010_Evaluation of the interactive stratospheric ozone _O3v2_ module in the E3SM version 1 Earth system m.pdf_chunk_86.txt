shortwave and longwave, whereas the warming in the low-
ermost stratosphere is because the warming in the longwave
dominates the cooling in the shortwave. The warming near
the tropopause at SH high latitudes is mainly caused by the
shortwave absorption.
The cooling near the tropopause and warming above it
generally lead to a higher tropopause deﬁned by the tempera-
ture lapse rate (Fig. 9). The tropopause changes are greater in
