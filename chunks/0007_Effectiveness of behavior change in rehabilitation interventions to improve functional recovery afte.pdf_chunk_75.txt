were at unclear or high risk of bias, thereby hindering the 
certainty of the observed outcomes. A systematic review 
by Sernandez 2021 [44] illustrated that early initiation of 
weight bearing and rehabilitation following operative ankle 
fractures is safe as it was not associated with a significant 
increase in complications in comparison to a delayed weight 
bearing approach. However, immediate mobilisation of the 
ankle may interfere with wound healing, and subsequently
