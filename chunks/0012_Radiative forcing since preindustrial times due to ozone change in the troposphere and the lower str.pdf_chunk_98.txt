posphere.
These differences may be connected to differ-
ent convective transport and will affect chemical ozone pro-
duction as well. Tropospheric NOx increases are largest at
the surface in mid-northern latitudes in all models, amount-
ing to several hundred pptv, and then decreasing with
height. The locations of the surface maxima agree very well
among the models, while their magnitudes range from about
300 pptv in the NCAR MACCM model to 900 pptv in the
