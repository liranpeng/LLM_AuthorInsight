et al., 2013; Young et al., 2013). The models used in these
assessments disagree on these overall CH4 and O3 reactiv-
ities (a.k.a. the budgets), and resolving the cause of such
differences is stymied because of the large number of pro-
cesses involved and the resulting highly heterogeneous dis-
tribution of chemical species that drive the reactions. Simply
put, the models use emissions, photochemistry and meteoro-
logical data to generate the distribution of key species such
