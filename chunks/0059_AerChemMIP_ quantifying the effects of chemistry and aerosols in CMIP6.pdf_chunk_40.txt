Grand Challenge on “Clouds, Circulation and Climate sensi-
tivity”. In addition, through the importance of natural sources
for WMGHGs and NTCFs, the proposed research questions
in AerChemMIP are well aligned with WCRP theme “Bio-
geochemical forcings and feedbacks”. The AerChemMIP
proposal focuses on four broad questions, listed and dis-
cussed below.
2.1
How have anthropogenic emissions contributed to
global radiative forcing and affected regional
climate over the historical period?
