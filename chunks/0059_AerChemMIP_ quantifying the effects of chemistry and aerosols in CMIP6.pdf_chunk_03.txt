Abstract. The Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison
Project (AerChemMIP) is endorsed by the Coupled-Model
Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) and is designed to quan-
tify the climate and air quality impacts of aerosols and
chemically reactive gases. These are speciﬁcally near-term
climate forcers (NTCFs: methane, tropospheric ozone and
aerosols, and their precursors), nitrous oxide and ozone-
