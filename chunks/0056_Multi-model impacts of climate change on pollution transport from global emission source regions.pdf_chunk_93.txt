and 5). These changes in CO-tracer concentrations are pri-
marily determined by the extent of co-location between con-
vective and biomass burning source regions and how convec-
tion changes over these emission source regions.
Reduced convective mass ï¬‚uxes in the future may also
partly explain decreases in CO-tracer concentrations in the
mid-latitude mid- to upper troposphere (Figs. 2 and 3), al-
though changes in the mid-latitude storm tracks may also
