convection parameterization confirm that it is not straightforward to draw conclusions on the seasonality effect on these models
performance.
Uncertainty quantification
In addition to the deterministic and statistical error metrics, we compare the performance of different Bayesian surrogate models
with respect to the returned uncertainty quantification. For a given input x, each of the RPN-based models returns an ensemble
