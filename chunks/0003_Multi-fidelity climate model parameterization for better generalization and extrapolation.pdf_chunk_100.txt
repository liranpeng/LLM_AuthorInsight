where ¯y represents the true target value averaged over the
test dataset D. The definition of the different choices for the
test dataset D is the same as detailed above for MAE.
Stochastic Metric (CRPS):
The Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)83,84 is
a generalization of the MAE for distributional predictions.
CRPS penalizes over-confidence in addition to inaccuracy in
ensemble predictions. A lower CRPS value corresponds to
