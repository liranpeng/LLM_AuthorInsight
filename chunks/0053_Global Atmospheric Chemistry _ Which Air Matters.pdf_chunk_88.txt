the A- and C-runs (not shown) conﬁrms that these two runs
have almost identical J’s as expected since these changes in
ozone and aerosols over 24 h between these two simulations
will have a small impact on regional average J’s.
While the A-run is clearly asking the modeling groups to
make some rather uncomfortable code modiﬁcations, these
tend to be at the very high level of disabling entire compo-
nents. Other approaches for indirectly comparing chemical
