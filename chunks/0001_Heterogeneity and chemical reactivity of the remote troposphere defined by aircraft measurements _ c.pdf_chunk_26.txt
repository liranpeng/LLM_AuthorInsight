tolysis rates. Our goal is to create a robust understanding of
the chemical statistics including the reactivities with which to
test and evaluate the free-running CCMs, and thus we do not
try to model the speciﬁc period of the ATom deployments.
Others may use the ATom data with hindcast CTMs to test
forecast models, but here we want to build a chemical clima-
tology.
The ﬁrst hard test of the A runs came with the second
ATom modeling paper (“How well can global chemistry
