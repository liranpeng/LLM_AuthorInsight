2. All South America (all‐SA) — It is possible that the discrepancies observed in the dry matter burned using
the modern spatial distribution of ﬁres may be due to the fact that the location of ﬁres has changed over
the past 1,000 years. The abundances of shorter‐lived trace gases in the atmosphere over the polar regions
are sensitive to the location of ﬁre emissions. Acetylene and ethane over Antarctica exhibit the highest
