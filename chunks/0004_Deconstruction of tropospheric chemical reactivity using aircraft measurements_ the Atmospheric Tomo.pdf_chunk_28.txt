umn, and so we conclude that the scatter in J values and re-
activities is driven primarily by the time-varying cloud ﬁelds.
(The UCI CTM uses 3 h averaged cloud ﬁelds.) The O3 ten-
dency (dO3/dt) has less scatter than any of the four reac-
tivities (P-O3, L-O3, L-CH4, L-CO) because the production
and loss co-vary with clouds and their net difference has less
scatter.
We expect the abundance of the reactive species to evolve
over the 24 h period of the reactivity calculation, and this is
