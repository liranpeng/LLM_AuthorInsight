perature and that can explain the slightly larger peak tropical
O3 in EAM versions. Poleward of 60â—¦transport plays a more
important role, and we see the differences between UCI and
EAM.
In terms of Taylor diagrams, this metric collapses to a
small region, indicating excellent performance (Fig. 3b).
Correlations are close to 1.0 for all simulations, indicating
excellent pattern agreement. Variances are underestimated by
the models, implying that the linearized chemistry is based
