pointed out by the critical review. Technological fixes for reduc-
tion in carbon-based CFA emissions exist in principle, but these
are resource-intensive and expensive with debatable reliability
(Edgerton et al., 2008; Hidy et al., 2012; MacCracken, 2008;
Wilson, 2012). The drivers for energy production and use con-
tinue to be accessibility, low cost, and reliability. These require-
ments are difficult to fulfill without a major carbon-fueled
component.
