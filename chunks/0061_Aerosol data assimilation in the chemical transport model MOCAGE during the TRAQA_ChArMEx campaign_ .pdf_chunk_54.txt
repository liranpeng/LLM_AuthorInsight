where E is the expectation (statistical average), Jmin is the
value of the cost function at the minimum and p is the num-
ber of observations. For this test, it is necessary to run the as-
similation system for a prolonged period of time and, in the
case of sufﬁcient number of observations, the matrix B will
not depend on its initial value any more. Because this method
is computationally expensive, a very rigorous optimization of
