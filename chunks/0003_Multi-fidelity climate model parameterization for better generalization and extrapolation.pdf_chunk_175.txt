different RPN-based models. It includes the results for heat and moisture tendencies at vertical levels 259, 494 and 761 hPa.
A perfect uncertainty quantification would strictly increase with the model’s error. For the heat tendency, the MF-RPN’s
uncertainty clearly displays a more increasing behavior with the error compared to the SF-HF-RPN and LF-RPN models for
all vertical levels since the red and yellow regions stretch over larger areas indicating a wider increase of the uncertainty as
