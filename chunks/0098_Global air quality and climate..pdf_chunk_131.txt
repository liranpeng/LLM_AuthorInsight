PM components (sulfate, nitrate, black carbon, organic) and
sizes.31,186,241,242,244–246,267,295–301 Future PM, like O3, is expected
to be driven by changes in both emissions and climate.
PM changes driven by local-to-regional anthropogenic
emissions are complex, depend on regional oxidant levels
(e.g., ref. 32 and 248), and cannot simply be scaled to changes
in regional emissions. Nevertheless, changes in sulfate aerosol
