transport sectors in 2000 (Myhre et al., 2011), but will in
2050 shift from a net positive to a net negative forcing. The
reason is the strong decline in ROAD emissions, which leads
to a high factor to correct for the transient response (1.77 as
noted above). As the short-term O3 RF is not inï¬‚uenced by
the time-history of emissions, the cooling effect will com-
pensate the warming effect and lead to a net negative RF.
It should be noted here that although all six models yield a
