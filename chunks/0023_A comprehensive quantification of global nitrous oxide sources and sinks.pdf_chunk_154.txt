approaches, consisting of four inversion frameworks89â€“92, provide a 
wide range of estimates largely because of systematic errors in the 
modelled atmospheric transport and stratospheric loss of N2O. In 
addition, the emissions from top-down analyses are dependent on 
the magnitude and distribution of the prior flux estimates to an extent 
that is strongly determined by the number of atmospheric N2O meas-
urements18. Inversions are generally not well constrained (and thus rely
