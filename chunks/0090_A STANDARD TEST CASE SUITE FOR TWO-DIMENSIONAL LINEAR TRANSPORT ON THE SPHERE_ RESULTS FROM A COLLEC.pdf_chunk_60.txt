pense of increased computational cost.
A further simpliﬁcation to SFF-CSLAM is to approxi-
mate the swept area with just one degree of freedom in-
stead of two or three as described above. For example, one
may use just one velocity vector at the center of each edge
to trace the ﬂux area so that the swept area is a rhom-
boid instead of a quadrilateral with straight (Miura, 2007)
or curved edges (Ullrich et al., 2013). This approach is
taken in the transport scheme implemented in the Icosahe-
