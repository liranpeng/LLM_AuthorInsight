Data: storm‑resolving models and preprocessing
This paper examines high-resolution atmospheric model data (5 kilometers or less horizontally) provided by 
the DYAMOND ­project4. To simplify modeling, we focus our new unsupervised method on the vertical velocity 
variable, giving us information about updraft and gravity wave dynamics across different scales and phenom-
ena. Specifically, we consider eight different DYAMOND GSRMs: the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic Weather and
