tors (similarly to CAM-FV) are used.
A scheme based on CCS and implemented on the reduced
latitude–longitude grid (for details on the reduced latitude–
longitude grid used here, see Fadeev, 2013) participated in
this intercomparison and is referred to as CCSRG (Tolstykh
and Shashkin, 2012). The version of CCSRG used here does
not have a limiter implemented. Tracer–mass coupling is
based on reconstructing tracer mass, ρφ, and not on the re-
construction of mixing ratio and density separately.
