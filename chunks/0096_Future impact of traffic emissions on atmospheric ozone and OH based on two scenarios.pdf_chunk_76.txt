largest O3 RF, and this forcing term will more than double
between 2025 and 2050, if the emissions evolve according to
the A1B scenario. The O3 RF from SHIP will also increase
over the same period, while ROAD will evolve from being
the transport sector with the largest O3 radiative forcing in
year 2000 (Myhre et al., 2011) to only represent 6 % of the
total transport-induced O3 RF in 2050 A1B. Further discus-
sion of short-term O3 RF and comparisons with other studies
are given in Sect. 4.
