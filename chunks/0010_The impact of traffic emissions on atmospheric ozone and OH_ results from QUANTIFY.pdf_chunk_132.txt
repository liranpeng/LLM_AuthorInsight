the subtropics up to 200 hPa caused by convective uplift of
NOx from maritime transport in the tropical and subtropical
latitudes.

Methane lifetime
As seen in the previous section ship emissions have the
largest effect on OH leading to the largest reduction of
methane lifetime (Table 7) among the three major modes
of transport. Methane lifetimes were calculated ofﬂine us-
ing the monthly mean CH4 and OH-ﬁelds from each model.
Note that no feedback factor is applied here, which would
