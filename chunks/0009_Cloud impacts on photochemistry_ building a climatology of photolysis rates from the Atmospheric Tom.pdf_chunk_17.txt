ments made under clear skies or with uniform 1-D cloud
layers for which an accurate solution can usually be calcu-
lated. We introduce here the ability to use CAFS “all-sky”
measurements made under a semi-objective sampling strat-
egy (i.e., ATom’s tomographic proﬁling makes pre-planned
slices through the troposphere, limited by available airports,
diverting only for dangerous weather). We test the collective
treatment of clouds and radiation in models insofar as they
