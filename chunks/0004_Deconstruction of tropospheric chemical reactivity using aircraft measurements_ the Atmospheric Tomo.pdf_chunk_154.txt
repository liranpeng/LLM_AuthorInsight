deployments. In the Atlantic, the v2b–v3 changes are not ob-
vious, except for reducing the ATom-2 values below 3 km to
look more like ATom-1. HOOH proﬁles often show a peak
(500–1000 ppt) in the lower troposphere, 1–5 km, with the
Atlantic usually being larger. For Paciﬁc ATom-1, NOx (and
P-O3) is particularly low, but HOOH (and L-O3) is particu-
larly high.
Given the importance of the tropics, we replot these pro-
