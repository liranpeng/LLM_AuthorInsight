were small in magnitude. The clear sky direct aerosol effect
over the period 2000–2012 showed small global mean forc-
ing based on the changes in aerosol abundance from MISR
satellite data (Murphy, 2013). The total aerosol forcing over
the period 1990–2010 and 2000–2010 in IPCC AR5 was
quantiﬁed as −0.03 and +0.02 W m−2, respectively (Myhre
et al., 2013b). Tropospheric ozone forcing was estimated
to be +0.03 W m−2 over the 1990–2010 period. Kuhn et
