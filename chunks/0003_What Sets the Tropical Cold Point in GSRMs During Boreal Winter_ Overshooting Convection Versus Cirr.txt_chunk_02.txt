The cold point tropopause, the minimum temperature within the tropical upper troposphere‐lower stratosphere region (UTLS), significantly impacts Earth's climate by influencing the amount of water vapor entering the lower stratosphere. Understanding which mechanisms are most important in setting the cold point temperature and height may help us better predict how it will change in a future warmed climate. In this analysis we evaluate two mechanisms that may influence the cold point—cold
