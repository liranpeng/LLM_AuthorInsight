easterly mid-tropospheric ﬂow from convection over Mexico
at that speciﬁc time (29 July 2016). Similarly, the ATom re-
activity at 1–3 km in the Atlantic is associated with biomass
burning in Africa and was measured in other trace species.
Thus, in terms of L-O3, the ATom–model differences may
be due to speciﬁc meteorological conditions, and this could
be tested with CTMs using 2016 meteorology and wildﬁres.
For L-CH4 (bottom row, Fig. 3), the ATom–model patterns
