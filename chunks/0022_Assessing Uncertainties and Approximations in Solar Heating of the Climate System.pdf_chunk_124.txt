A clear result from B2015, LBYY, Räisänen (2002) and this study is that 2-stream RT codes systematically 
underestimate the atmospheric absorption by all clouds, and for ice clouds the error is larger in absolute 
amount. They also overestimate the surface flux, and in all of Räisänen's efforts to tune a 2-stream code, 
these fundamental errors remain. The ability to resolve the scattered light across multiple zenith angles is
