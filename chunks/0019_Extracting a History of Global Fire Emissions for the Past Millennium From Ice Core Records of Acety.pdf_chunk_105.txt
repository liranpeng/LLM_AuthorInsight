with savanna/grassland emission ratios and all burning in South America. In this case, there is only one
scenario in which all three inferred dry matter burned histories agree within estimated uncertainties
(Figure 7). This is the case where ethane and methane have no geologic emissions and a high
chlorine sink.
4.2.2. Sensitivity to Assumptions About Biofuel Emissions
The modern‐day distribution of biofuel emissions used in our calculations may not reﬂect the preindustrial
