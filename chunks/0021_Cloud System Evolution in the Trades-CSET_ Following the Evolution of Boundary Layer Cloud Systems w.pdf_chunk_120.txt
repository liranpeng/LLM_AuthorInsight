2018). For example, the UHSAS aerosol concentrations measured on the outbound RF 06 (7 
July) and inbound RF 07 (9 July) are shown in Fig. 13. On the inbound flight there is a well-
defined area of very low aerosol concentrations near the mean tops of clouds. The veil 
clouds and clean layers observed appear to be closely coupled to the mesoscale cloud 
systems like those shown in Fig. 11. A challenge will be to fully understand how the gray
