field et al., 2017; Thornberry et al., 2017). We concur with LBYY that multi-stream scattering codes, such 
as CCCma's 4-stream or Solar-J's 8-stream, will become more essential for accuracy and also more cost 
effective in climate models. They are also necessary to assess ice cloud optics since the 2-stream problems 
obscure such improvements.
6.  Cloud overlap
Treatment of overlapping clouds provides a challenge for climate models in solving the RT problem as well
