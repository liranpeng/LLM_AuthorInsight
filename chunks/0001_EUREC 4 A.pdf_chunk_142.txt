of wind speeds at 40 m to wind speeds at 200 m, as a mea-
sure of surface layer wind shear, is close (ca. 0.95) to unity.
Combined with surface heat and momentum ﬂuxes measured
by other platforms, the lidars provide a unique opportunity to
identify the inﬂuence of (moist) convection on wind stress at
the surface.
