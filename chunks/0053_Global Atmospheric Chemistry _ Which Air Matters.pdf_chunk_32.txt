us which air parcels matter for chemical budgets, including,
for example, whether infrequently observed pollution plumes
are responsible for a large fraction of ozone production.
In Sect. 2 we deﬁne our use of reactivity in this paper
(i.e., the production and loss of ozone, the loss of methane)
and identify about a dozen key chemical species and other
variables that once initialized determine the chemical evo-
lution of an air parcel. In Sect. 3 we show how the CTMs–
