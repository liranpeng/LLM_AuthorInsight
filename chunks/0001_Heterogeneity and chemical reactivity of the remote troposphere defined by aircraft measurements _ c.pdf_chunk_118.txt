the ATom data. Also, the models are missing a strong HCHO
peak at 300 ppt in the eastern Paciﬁc, probably convection-
related, speciﬁc to that time period. Thus, in terms of these
HOx precursors, the model climatologies appear to be at least
as reactive as the ATom data.
While the ATom-1 data in Fig. 4 are limited to single tran-
sects, the model NOx discrepancies apply across the three
tropical regions, and the simple chemical statistics for these
