12 h, 12–24 h, 24–72 h and over 72 h.
Results  Time from admission to surgery was recorded for 10,659 patients, of these time of fall was available for 10,346 
patients. Mean age was 82.2 years (sd 8.39) for the cohort and 30 day mortality was 6.20%.
Odds of 30-day mortality was 1.43 (CI 1.057–1.988, p = 0.025) for delay to surgery from admission of over 12 h compared 
to under 12 h. Odds ratios for 30-day mortality were not significant at any other time threshold. The odds of 30-day mortality
