where ⟨x,y⟩represents the inner product of x and y. Anal-
ogously to the tangent linear operator, the adjoint operator
can be considered as a sequence of operators. Each discrete
operation in the tangent linear operator has a corresponding
operation in the adjoint operator, but the order of execution
is reversed.

The error covariance matrices
The background error covariance matrix is a key component
of the data assimilation system. It deﬁnes the background er-
