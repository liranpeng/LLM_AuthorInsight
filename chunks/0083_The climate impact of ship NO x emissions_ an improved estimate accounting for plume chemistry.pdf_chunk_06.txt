Introduction
Maritime shipping affects climate through emissions of CO2,
nitrogen oxides (NOx ≡NO + NO2), and SO2, the latter two
of which indirectly inﬂuence methane, ozone, aerosols, and
clouds. Other climate impacts due to ship emissions of CO,
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and primary aerosols
have signiﬁcant uncertainties, but are much smaller (Eyring
et al., 2010). While ships produce only 3 % of anthropogenic
