is good agreement concerning the radiative forcing due to
ozone change in the troposphere.
Global mean net radiative forcing values are listed in Ta-
ble 5. Globally and annually averaged, the radiative forc-
ing due to tropospheric ozone change ranges from 0.25 to
0.45 Wm−2, the mean value and standard deviation being
0.32 Wm−2 and 0.06 Wm−2, respectively. This value agrees
well with the estimate of 0.35±0.15 Wm−2 suggested by
