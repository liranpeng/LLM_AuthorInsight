methane and the chorine sink likely do not account for the differences in the dry matter burned histories
derived from the three trace gases. One could argue that the results for methane are most uncertain, given
the complexity of the budget, the difﬁculty in establishing whether isotopic end‐members remain constant
in time, and assumptions about changes in microbial emissions. Putting aside methane, the best agreement
