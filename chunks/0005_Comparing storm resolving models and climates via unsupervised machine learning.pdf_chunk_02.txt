Our approach automatically learns physically meaningful notions of similarity from low-dimensional 
latent data representations that the different models produce. This enables an intercomparison of 
nine GSRMs based on their high-dimensional simulation data (2D vertical velocity snapshots) and 
reveals that only six are similar in their representation of atmospheric dynamics. Furthermore, we 
uncover signatures of the convective response to global warming in a fully unsupervised way. Our
