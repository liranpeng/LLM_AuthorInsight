latitudes. The lower overall SCO outside the tropics seen in
O3v2 versus O3v1 is a closer match to the observations but
is still biased high in the SH. In Fig. 1 we also show the dif-
ference plot of EAM O3v2 minus O3v1 (extended to 90◦S–
90◦N). Outside the tropics, the O3v2 SCO is consistently
15–30 DU less than that of O3v1, a direct result of the O3v1
error in overwriting O3 in the lower stratosphere and upper
troposphere.
Climate models often capture the mean better than the
