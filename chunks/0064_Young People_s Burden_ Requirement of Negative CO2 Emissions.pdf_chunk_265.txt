Alternative scenario
Simulated global temperature for the climate forcings of
the “alternative scenario” discussed in Sect. 6 are shown in
Fig. A12. The climate model, with sensitivity 3 ◦C for dou-
bled CO2, is the same as used for Fig. 12.

Non-CO2 GHGs
CO2 is the dominant forcing in future climate scenarios.
Growth of non-CO2 GHG climate forcing is likely to be
even smaller, relative to CO2 forcing, than in recent decades
