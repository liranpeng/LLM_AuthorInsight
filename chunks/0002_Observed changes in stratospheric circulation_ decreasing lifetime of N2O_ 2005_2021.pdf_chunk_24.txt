tal loss), and in latitude it is 30◦S to 30◦N (75 %); see
P2015. Thus we focus on the tropical middle stratosphere.
Photolysis (Reaction R1) dominates loss here (by more than
90 %), and the monthly mean J-N2O at the Equator (Fig. 1e)
shows only a consistent decline across the critical region
from −0.5 ± 0.1 %/decade at the top of the region (3 hPa) to
−1.3 ± 0.3 %/decade at altitudes below 10 hPa. This change
by itself would reduce the loss.
