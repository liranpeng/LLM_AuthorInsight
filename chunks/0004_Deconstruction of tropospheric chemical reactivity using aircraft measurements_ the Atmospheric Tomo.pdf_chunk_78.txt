shows extensive regions in the middle to upper troposphere
with P-O3 > 3 ppb d−1, and these look like continental out-
ﬂow with both NOx and HOx sources. The eastern Paciﬁc
shows extensive 1–2 km thick, 10◦latitude layers of mostly
above 8 km. In the eastern Paciﬁc these P-O3 layers are
clearly separated from the moderately high (ATom-23) to
extremely high (ATom-14) L-O3 > 5 ppb d−1 layers below
8 km. The large L-O3 (and also L-CH4 and L-CO) layers
