Ri inﬂuence the weighting of the terms Jb and Jo.
To ﬁnd the optimal solution we minimize the cost function
J by computing its gradient:
∇J(δx) = B−1δx +

After estimating the analysis increment δxa, we add it to
the aerosol abundance at the beginning of the cycle. The
model is then run over a cycle length (1 h) to obtain the anal-
ysed trajectory. Its endpoint is used as the initial background
ﬁeld for the next cycle.
