the ﬂow throughout the integration or at least for multiple
time steps. Each sub-category of (semi-)Lagrangian ﬁnite-
volume schemes is discussed in a separate section below.
Conservation of mass in (semi-)Lagrangian ﬁnite-volume
schemes is based on the physical constraint that the integral
of mass over the Lagrangian areas at time level n and n + 1
must match. This physical constraint is more rigorous than
the requirement for mass conservation in ﬂux-form schemes,
