iters are applied in the one-dimensional PPM reconstruc-
tions. Since the limiters are applied to the PPM operators that
are one-dimensional, over- and undershoots are only elimi-
nated along coordinate directions and not in the transverse
direction. Hence, CAM-FV is only approximately shape-
preserving. Air–tracer coupling is through “super-cycling”.
