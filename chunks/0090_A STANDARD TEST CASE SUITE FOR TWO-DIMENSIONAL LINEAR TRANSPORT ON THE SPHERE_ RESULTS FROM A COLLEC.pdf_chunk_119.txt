5. ability of the transport scheme to preserve pre-existing
functional relations between tracers,
6. ability of the transport scheme to deal with divergent
ﬂows (Nair and Lauritzen, 2010).
These topics are discussed in separate sections below.

Numerical convergence rates: Gaussian hills
The goal of this test is to estimate numerical convergence
rates for the normalized error norms ℓi, which are referred to
as Kun
i
for the unlimited scheme and (if applicable) Ksp
i
for
