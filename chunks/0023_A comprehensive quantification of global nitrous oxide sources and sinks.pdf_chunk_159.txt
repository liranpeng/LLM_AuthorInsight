Pacific, the northern Indian ocean) relative to the global ocean. These 
low oxygen zones are predominantly influenced by high yield N2O forma-
tion processes (for example, denitrification and enhanced nitrification). 
Regional observation-based assessments have also suggested that these 
regions may produce more N2O than is simulated by the models32. The 
current generation of global ocean biogeochemistry models are not 
sufficiently accurate to represent the high N2O production processes
