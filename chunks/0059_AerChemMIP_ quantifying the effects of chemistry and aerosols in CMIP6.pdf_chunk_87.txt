starts in 1950. The “AER” sufﬁx means models should at least calculate tropospheric aerosols driven by emission ﬂuxes. The “CHEMT” or
“CHEMS” sufﬁx means that at least tropospheric or stratospheric chemistry are required. Models should always be run with the maximum
complexity available. The species columns refer to the speciﬁcations for concentrations (CH4, N2O and CFC/HCFC) or emissions (aerosol
