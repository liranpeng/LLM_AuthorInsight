(Joseph et al., 1976), and we scaled the optical depth of each
cloud layer by a factor of 1−1.1P1/3, with a minimum value
of 0.04. P1 (3 times the asymmetry factor) is the second term
in the Legendre expansion of the scattering phase function
for the cloud in that layer. The derived optical depth in each
layer is calculated from the reduction in direct beam across
the layer (Beer–Lambert law) and put into the single Fast-J
calculation with the original cloud properties of that layer,
