timescale of this is unclear (O’Connor et al., 2010; Quiquet
et al., 2015).
Here we examine the fossil fuel emission reductions re-
quired to restore atmospheric CO2 to 350 ppm or less, so as
to keep global temperature close to the Holocene range, in
addition to the canonical 1.5 and 2 ◦C targets. Quantitative
investigation requires consideration of Earth’s energy imbal-
ance, changing climate forcings, and climate sensitivity.
