generated front has some differences in morphology compared to
the ground truth, the consistency of its morphology across winds
and temperature is reassuring. The intense rainfall associated with
the convergence at the front can be seen in the radar reflectivity for
the same date and time in bottom row of Fig.Â 3. The generated
radar reflectivity is appropriately concentrated near the sharpened
frontal boundary at the cold sector. We expand this analysis of the
