of multi-phase reactions, as reviewed recently.132,133 SOA
likely contributes a substantial fraction of total organic
aerosol134 but the impact of SOA on the radiative balance of
the atmosphere is poorly understood (e.g., ref. 135). Some
global models neglect SOA formation from anthropogenic
precursor emissions,78 which would lead to an underestimate
of RF from SOA.
Furthermore, formation of biogenic SOA can be enhanced
in the presence of anthropogenic organics and particulate
