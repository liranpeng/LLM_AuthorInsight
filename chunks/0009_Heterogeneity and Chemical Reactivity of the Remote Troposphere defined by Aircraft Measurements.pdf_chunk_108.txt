H. Guo et al.: Heterogeneity and chemical reactivity of the remote troposphere
in parcels with 20–80 ppt. This discrepancy is ampliﬁed in
the lower troposphere, 0–4 km (second row). In the middle of
the Paciﬁc, our chemistry models are missing a large source
of lower tropospheric NOx. The obvious source of oceanic
NOx is lightning since oceanic sources of organonitrates or
other nitrate species measured on ATom could not supply
