on OH. The radiative efﬁciency in the ﬁxed OPE model is
likely smaller than assumed here (see Sects. 2.3 and 3.1), but
we have not recalculated it because the ﬁxed OPE model is
not used to derive our best estimate.
Global aerosol impacts of ship NOx have been identiﬁed
as a knowledge gap that we brieﬂy estimate (Eyring et al.,
2010). Ship NOx increases oxidative production of nitrate
and sulfate in our simulations by 9 % and 0.4 %, respectively,
