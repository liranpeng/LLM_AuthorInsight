with downstream and upstream differences of 4- 8 Â°C and the mean near-surface winds 
decreasing in speed and the cloudiness decreases (roughly 80-90% to 40-50 %; Fig. 6).
Sampling areas at the beginning and the ends of individual trajectories for the 14 flights are 
overlain over the mean cloudiness from the GOES analyses shown in Fig. 6. Most of the 
initial sampling (blue) areas are in high cloudiness areas relative to the areas at the end
