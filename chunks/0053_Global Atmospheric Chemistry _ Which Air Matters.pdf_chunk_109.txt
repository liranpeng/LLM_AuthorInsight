regions (surface to 500 hPa, 20◦S to 60◦N) it ranges from
1–4 % for L-CH4 to 2–8 % for P-O3. A remaining question
(not resolved with the datasets assembled here) is the year-
to-year variance of basin-wide reactivities perhaps associated
with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.
The six models’ 1-D probability distributions for O3, CO,
NOx, and HCHO over the tropical mid-Paciﬁc basin are
shown in Fig. 5, and simple statistics (mean ± SD) are pre-
