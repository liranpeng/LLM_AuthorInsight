basis and average over the basins, providing an observational basis for these previously model-only diagnostics.
We had found that most model differences in the ozone and methane budgets are caused by the models calcu-
lating different climatologies for the key species such as O3, CO, H2O, NOx, CH4, and T , and thus these ATom
measurements make a substantial contribution to the understanding of model differences and even identifying
model errors in global tropospheric chemistry.
