fractions), which does not invoke cloud-overlap and ICAs.   SJ can be run in flat, 
spherical, refractive, and geometric options.  SJ by default uses a constant ocean surface 
albedo (OSA = 0.06) but can invoke OSA to be of function of wavelength, incident 
angle (including scattered light) and surface wind.   
SJ/RAN 
SJ run with MAX-RAN cloud overlap. 
SJ/RRX 
The 78 IR sub-bins are replaced with the RRTM-SW benchmark codeâ€™s 144 sub-bins.
