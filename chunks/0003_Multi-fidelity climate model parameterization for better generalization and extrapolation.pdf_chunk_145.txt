while still showing a few negative R2 values for this extrapolation task like all other models. For the pressure level 494 hPa,
the negative R2 regions for the MF-RPN model include part of the South-East Pacific region, of the south Atlantic ocean and
of the African Sahara. However, all these regions are significantly smaller for the pressure level 259 hPa compared to the
regions observed for 494 hPa (white regions in MF-RPN plots in figures 7.a and 7.b). Similarly the negative R2 regions for
