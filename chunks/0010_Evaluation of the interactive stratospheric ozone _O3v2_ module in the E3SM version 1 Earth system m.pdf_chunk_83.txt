Simpson et al., 2009), whereas the decreased N2 gradient
at SH middle-latitude tropopause facilitates the wave propa-
gation carrying the poleward heat ﬂux. The mean Eliassen–
Palm (E–P) ﬂux and its differences in divergence (Fig. A2f)
present a consistent picture as the N2 ﬁgure. Similar ther-
mal and dynamical responses to the heating changes near the
tropopause are reported by Hsu et al. (2013) when changing
the ozone production from O2 photolysis in the lower tropi-
cal stratosphere.
