appears that compressed CO2 has the best health characteris-
tics, while the fluorinated HFCs and CFCs pose potential long-
term chronic health effects from hydrofluoric acid (a combus-
tion product when fluoridated compounds are exposed to
extreme heat). The critical review only touched on the uncer-
tainties of long-term fluorine emissions and their decay pro-
ducts. Toohey (2010) states that â€œfor thorough understanding
of the environmental impacts of replacements for CFCs,
