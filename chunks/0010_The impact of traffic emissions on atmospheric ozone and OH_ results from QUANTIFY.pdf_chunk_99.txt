Table 5. Globally averaged ozone perturbations (unscaled) by transport mode for the lower and upper troposphere in pptv. Also given is the
maximum percentage change relative to the unperturbed case. Scaled percentage values are give in italics. The analysis is also shown for the
latitude band of 30◦–60◦N indicating zonal mean as well as maximum perturbations (note that the relative and absolute perturbations can
