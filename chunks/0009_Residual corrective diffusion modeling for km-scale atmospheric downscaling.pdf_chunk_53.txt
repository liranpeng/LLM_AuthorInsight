Another important unsolved challenge is optimally calibrating
CorrDiffâ€™s generated uncertainty to better match its error levels.
This is somewhat unexpected since diffusion models for image
generation are known to be over-dispersive in the sense of
producing low-quality samples and variance-reducing techniques
are often used during the sampling to discourage such outliers40,41.
The lack of grid-point-level spread here could owe to a number of
