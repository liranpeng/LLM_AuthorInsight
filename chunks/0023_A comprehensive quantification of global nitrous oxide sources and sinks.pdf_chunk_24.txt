bottom-up approach (3.6 (2.7–4.5) Tg N yr−1) indicate a slight decline 
at a rate of 0.06 Tg N yr−1 per decade (P < 0.05), whereas the top-down 
approach gives a higher but stable value of 5.1 (3.4–7.1) Tg N yr−1 during 
1998–2016 (Table 1).
On the basis of bottom-up approaches, anthropogenic N2O emissions 
increased from 5.6 (3.6–8.7) Tg N yr−1 in the 1980s to 7.3 (4.2–11.4) Tg N 
yr−1 in 2007–2016, at a rate of 0.6 ± 0.2 Tg N yr−1 per decade (P < 0.05).
