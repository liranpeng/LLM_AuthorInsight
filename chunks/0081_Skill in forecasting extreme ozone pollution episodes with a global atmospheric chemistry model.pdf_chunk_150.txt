test different decades from the ACCMIP climate simulations
to detect a shift in such episodes that falls outside the ex-

Conclusions
In evaluating a future scenario for air quality, one can iden-
tify four major contributing factors: (1) global emissions
that alter atmospheric composition and thence baseline levels
(lowest percentiles) of near-surface O3 and particulate matter
(PM); (2) global changes in climate that also alter these base-
