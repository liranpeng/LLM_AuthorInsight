ESM convection superparameterization
The problem considered here consists of predicting subgrid-
scale tendencies of heat and moisture convection (i.e. time
rate of change) at all vertical levels and for every timestep30.
The convection parameterization for climate models is be-
coming a mature problem given the recent studies focus-
ing on it2,3,26,62,63. The parameterization input is similar
to the standard Community Earth System Model version
