spheric models show that MCF decay responds to the observed
changes in tropical temperatures and water vapor, increasing in a
warmer, wetter world. Also, the feedback of the primary isotope of
methane on OH is well established (3, 28â€“30), and it increases the
impact of emissions by 40% compared with the lifetime derived
from MCF decay. The difficulty lies in deciding which of the many
3D model results provides the most useful priors.
