Environmental context The need to describe the Earthâ€™s system or any of its components with a quantity that has units of time is ubiquitous. These quantities are used as metrics of the system to describe the response to a perturbation, the cumulative effect of an action or just the budget in terms of sources and sinks. Given a complex, non-linear system, there are many different ways to derive such quantities, and careful definitions are needed to avoid mistaken approximations while providing
