with the baseline physics of the atmospheric model and reduce model reliability. This study introduces the use of a novelty detector to mask ML corrections when the atmospheric state is deemed out‐of‐sample. The novelty detector is trained on profiles of temperature and specific humidity in a semi‐supervised fashion using samples from the coarsened reference fine‐resolution simulation. The novelty detector responds to particularly biased simulations relative to the reference simulation by
