under the admittedly unrealistic assumption of modern ﬁre and biogeography. At most two of the trace gases
yield similar dry matter burned histories for any of the four model scenarios. Interestingly, the shortest‐lived
gas, acetylene, yields the highest dry matter burned through time in all scenarios. This suggests that changes
in the geographic distribution of ﬁres could reconcile the burning histories. For example, sedimentary
