interpolation and does not face the same level of distributional
challenges.
To sidestep these challenges, we decompose the generation into two
steps (Fig. 6). The first step predicts the conditional mean using
(UNet) regression (see also Supplementary Section 3 and
Supplementary Fig. S1 for details), and the second step learns a
correction using a diffusion model as follows:
$${\bf{x}} = \underbrace{{\mathbb{E}}[{\bf{x}}| {\bf{y}}]}
_{:= {\boldsymbol{\mu }}({\rm{regression}})} + \quad
