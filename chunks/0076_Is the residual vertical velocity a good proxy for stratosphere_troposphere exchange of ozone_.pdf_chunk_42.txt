For the Southern Hemisphere (SH), a similar progression is seen. Thus, the eddy ﬂux (though not explicitly
calculated here) is a major part of the STE O3 ﬂux.
To evaluate the residual ﬂuxes, we compare the seasonality of the hemispheric residual ﬂuxes across the
100 hPa surface (solid line in Figure 1d) with that of the simulated hemispheric ﬂuxes across the same sur-
face (dashed line in Figure 1d). The simulated O3 ﬂux peaks in the winter for both NH and SH similar to the
