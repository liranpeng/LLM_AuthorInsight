but this is likely minor.
We estimated that 200 people traveled to EUREC4A. If
each is further assumed to have ﬂown 15 000 km (about the
round-trip distance from Frankfurt to Grantley Adams Inter-
national Airport in Barbados) in economy class, then we can
adopt an emission estimate of 75 gCO2km−1 per passenger
(from Atmosfair for a non-stop ﬂight with an Airbus 340–
500). This 200×15000 km×75 gCO2km−1 = 225 000 kg of
CO2 emissions. More modern aircraft have substantially re-
