will be reported in Bosler (2013).
Note that the remeshing scheme interpolates the La-
grangian parameter rather than the scalar. Hence LPM avoids
introducing overshoots and undershoots in the scalar, and
there is no artiﬁcial mixing (the error norms φmax and φmin
are zero throughout all test cases, and the mixing errors for
test case 5 are also zero).
Note also that mesh size is not well-deﬁned since the par-
ticles are moving, so instead we report the average angu-
