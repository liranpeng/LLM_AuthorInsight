ter refueling (about 90 min later) to execute a second round
of sampling, accompanied by HALO returning for another
210 min tour of the EUREC4A-Circle. All told this resulted in
18 coordinated (4 h) ﬂight segments, one of which involved
the P-3 substituting for HALO on one of its nighttime ﬂights.
A ﬁrst target of the ﬂight strategy was the measurement,
for each sounding circle, of the vertical proﬁle of mass diver-
gence using dropsondes (following Bony and Stevens, 2019).
