models (using each model’s 5-day mean as its reference case,
Table S3). Also, the slope decreases from about 1.01 to 0.96
through August as expected with declining photolysis rates
in the north.
The rms difference across the ﬁve days is also a measure of
how well the 5-day parcel mean can represent the true chemi-
cal model. Assuming that the cloud variability is random, the
5-day means with respect to other models are not really dif-
ferent unless that model–model rms exceeds some fraction
