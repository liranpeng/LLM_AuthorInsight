Cloud variations on synoptic scales are primary sources
of noise in this study. These are difﬁcult to standardize from
either model or observation, given the wide range of meth-
ods for treating cloud scattering and overlap. Cloud-driven
changes in reactivity are clear in comparisons across models
and also within the same model. Use of a single day for com-
parison is inadequate. This protocol selects ﬁve days across
the month to sample cloud ﬁelds, and this provides a stable
