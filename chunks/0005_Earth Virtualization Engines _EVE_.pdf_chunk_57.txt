EVE will allow impact communities, who link ecological changes to
patterns of weather and water, to leverage ever richer descriptions
of present and past climates to scenarios for the future and to
develop strategies for building resilience. EVE's ability to bring forth
such worlds will come as much from the fidelity of its new models
as from the power of its new technologies and its ability to
equitably engage those who need its information most.
