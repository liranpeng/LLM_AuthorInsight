tospheric water vapor (H2O) production, and (4) changes in the
production of certain aerosols. The most important reaction driving
these impacts is the destruction of hydrogen by OH:

OH is the most important and powerful oxidant in the
atmosphere8,9. Oxidation by OH is the major sink of hydrogen,
methane, and other compounds in the atmosphere. The levels of
