ocean’s upper kilometer using a wide assortment of in-
struments, including underway CTDs, moving vessel pro-
ﬁlers, vertical microstructure proﬁlers (VMP and MSS), ex-
pendable bathythermographs (XBTs), and expendable CTDs
(XCTDs). Three ocean gliders (one SeaExplorer and two
Slocum electric gliders) provided dense sampling (more
than 1300 proﬁles, most to at least 700 m, Fig. 5) of sub-
surface structures associated with mesoscale eddies. Of
