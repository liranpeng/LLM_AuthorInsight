opposing inï¬‚uences from a warming climate: lower baseline
O3 levels but higher O3 in polluted regions and seasons.7,234
These results are plotted alongside several studies that report
spatial ranges for daytime statistics during the high-O3 season.
Fig. 3 shows that climate change-induced increases in surface
O3 of up to 10 ppb have been estimated for populated regions
over the United States by 2050 and up to 6 ppb over Europe by
2030 during the high-O3 season. At the sub-continental scale,
