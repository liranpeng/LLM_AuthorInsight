certainties within a single climate-relevant framework. Where more accurate physics or numerical solutions 
are known, we can estimate the error in current RT codes, and where there is fundamental uncertainty, we can 
estimate the potential for error using different methods for framing the problem.
The solar heating module Solar-J (Hsu et al., 2017; hence H2017) is embedded in our chemistry-transport
