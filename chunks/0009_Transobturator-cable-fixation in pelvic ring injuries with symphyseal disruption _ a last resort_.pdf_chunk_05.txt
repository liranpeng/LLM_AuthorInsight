months. No complications associated with TOCF were observed during
the surgical procedure or follow-up.
Conclusion
TOCF showed no procedure-associated complications and effectively
supported symphyseal healing in all cases. The main indications were
obesity, poor bone quality in elderly patients, and revision cases. TOCF
could be considered as a last treatment option in open-book pelvic
injuries where plating or external fixation is at risk to fail.
