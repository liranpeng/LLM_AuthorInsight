motivated work in climate services to “downscale” models with
much reduced (100 km) granularity to a finer scale. Hence the
phrase “local granularity, globally” emphasizes the importance of
the kilometer scale for impacts, globally; for observations whose
footprint is often on a local scale, globally; and for how important
climate processes (ocean eddies, boundary currents, overflows and
throughflows, orographic effects, and atmospheric convection)
