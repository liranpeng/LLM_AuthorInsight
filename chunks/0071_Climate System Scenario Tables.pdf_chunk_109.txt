2.21 and 2.22, and also Figure 11.24a. Confidence intervals (5 to 95% for HadCRUT4 only) take into account measurement, sampling, bias and coverage uncertainties. Also shown are temperature 
increases between the CMIP5 reference period (1986–2005) and four earlier averaging periods, where 1850–1900 is the early instrumental temperature record. Uncertainties in these temperature 
differences are 5 to 95% confidence intervals.
