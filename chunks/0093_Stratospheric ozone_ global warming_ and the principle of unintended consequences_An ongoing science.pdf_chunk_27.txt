et al. (2013) hypothesized that mitigating HFC emissions could
play an important role in limiting warming to less than 2C and
could help reduce it by [projected] 0.25 to 0.35C by 2100.
Bianco et al. (2013) concluded that eliminating HFC (emissions)
“represents the biggest opportunity for GHG emission reduc-
tions behind [fossil fueled] power plants [emissions].”
IPCC (2007a) projections have considered options for no
