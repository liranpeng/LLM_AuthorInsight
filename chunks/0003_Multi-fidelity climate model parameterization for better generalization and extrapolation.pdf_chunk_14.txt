come the uncertainty underestimation. RPNs take advan-
tage of an explicit incorporation of prior knowledge in order
to improve the model predictions in regions where limited
or no training data is available58â€“60. There has been addi-
tional theoretical studies proving the conservative uncertainty
obtained with RPNs and their ability to reliably detect out-
of-distribution samples61. RPNs have also been proven to
