With GMI and UCI also running tracer F11X, we assemble similar diagnostics for surface F11X and find 
surprising results (see supplementary Figure S3 and Table S2). The surface patterns for F11X match those 
of their N2OX counterparts nearly exactly but with twice the amplitude. The cc values of F11X versus N2OX 
within each model range from 0.96 to 1.00 for the annual, QBO composite, or the 2010 anomalous QBO
