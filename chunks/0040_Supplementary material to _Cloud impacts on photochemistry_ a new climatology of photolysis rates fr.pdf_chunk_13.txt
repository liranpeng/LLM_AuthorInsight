50 ºN x 170 ºE – 225 ºE).  Averages are made over 24 hours for one day in mid-August as used in this paper.  For 
these data (unlike the J-value statistics), all hours are weighted equally independent of solar zenith angle. Column 
total COD for each region is given in the order/color-indexed numbers on the right of each COD panel.
