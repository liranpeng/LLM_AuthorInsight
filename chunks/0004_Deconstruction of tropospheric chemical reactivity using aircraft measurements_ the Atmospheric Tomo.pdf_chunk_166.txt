Figure 54. Altitude proﬁles of the mean L-CO (ppb d−1) over the
Paciﬁc and Atlantic basins for ATom-1234. See Fig. 51. Compare
with Fig. 32. Solid lines are MDS-3, and dashed lines are MDS-2b.
cause these are critical species based on the sensitivities (Ta-
ble 2). The NOx PDs are paired with v3 vs. v2b panels: they
show large shifts in the eastern Paciﬁc, as expected from ear-
lier comparisons. The tropical Atlantic NOx PDs also show
large shifts with the versions. Thus, the NOx PDs should
