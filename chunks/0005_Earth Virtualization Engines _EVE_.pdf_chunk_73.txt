models cannot simulate. The more coarse-grained models can
likewise be applied more conceptually to help rationalize processes
that EVE models do simulate. EVE will also enable a more
consistent application of regional models on similar (decadal)
timescales or yet more finely grained local models on shorter
timescales to support “wide scaling” – the investigation of local
change to the multitude of possible local interventions (e.g., water
