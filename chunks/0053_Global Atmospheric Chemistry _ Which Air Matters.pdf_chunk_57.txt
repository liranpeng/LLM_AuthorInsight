of intense emissions of short-lived species or in highly pol-
luted environments such as urban, industrial, or open ﬁres.
After pollution plumes have been separated from sources and
aged a few days, our key variables should deﬁne the reactiv-
ity. Such conditions apply to most of the troposphere, partic-
ularly the air over the vast Paciﬁc and Atlantic Ocean basins.
With aged pollution plumes, we expect that some key species
(e.g., alkenes, isoprene, aromatics, and higher alkanes) will
