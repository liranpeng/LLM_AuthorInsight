mapping between high-fidelity parameterization inputs and
outputs.
Another important aspect regarding the chosen architecture
of the MF-RPN model is the uncertainty propagation across
fidelity levels. Once properly trained, any uncertainty in the
paramterization input is propagated to the corresponding low-
fidelity parameterization output via the low-fidelity RPN (red
network in figure 1). These low-fidelity predictions are di-
rectly taken as inputs for the second ensemble (blue network in
