mate feedback when including the interactive stratospheric
ozone chemistry in an Earth system model. The negative
feedback reduces the climate sensitivity and is mainly caused
by the changes in longwave radiation associated with the
Brewerâ€“Dobson circulation-driven reduction of ozone and
water vapor at the tropical lower stratosphere and cirrus
cloud changes. Since the tropospheric ozone is prescribed in
