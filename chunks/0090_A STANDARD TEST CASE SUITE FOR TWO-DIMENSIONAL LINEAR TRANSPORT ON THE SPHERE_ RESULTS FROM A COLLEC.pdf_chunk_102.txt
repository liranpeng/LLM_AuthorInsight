linear Gaussian grid (thus larger truncation wave number)
gives better accuracy for the same number of grid points,
especially at low resolutions.
Trajectories are computed using the traditional method
based on bilinear interpolation along great circles (Stani-
forth and Côté, 1991). A two-time-level scheme (Temper-
ton and Staniforth, 1987) is implemented for efﬁciency. It
is conﬁrmed that the two-time-level scheme gives exactly the
same results as the three-time-level scheme used by Enomoto
