mately double those of Europe and the USA for future decades. For
A1B_HIGH, this results in an extra emission of w1.4 Tg N yr1 from
Asia by 2025, which decreases to w0.4 Tg N yr1 by 2050. For the
Middle East (ME), A1B_HIGH results in this region becoming the
second most important region for RTE by 2050 and for South
America, A1B_HIGH results in the trend in RTE exhibiting a modest
increase by 2025 (equating to differences of w0.2e0.3 Tg N yr1).
