surface aerosol and ozone based on observations (e.g. −1 to
−3 % yr−1 in aerosols over the USA and Europe). The global
mean radiative forcing due to ozone and aerosol changes over
the 1990–2015 period increased by +0.17 ± 0.08 W m−2,
with approximately one-third due to ozone. This increase
is more strongly positive than that reported in IPCC AR5.
The main reasons for the increased positive radiative forc-
ing of aerosols over this period are the substantial reduction
