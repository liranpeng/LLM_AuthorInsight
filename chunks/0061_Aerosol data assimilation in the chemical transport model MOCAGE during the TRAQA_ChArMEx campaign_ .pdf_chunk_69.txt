reported Poisson counting error is in the range 5â€“15 %. The
high-frequency instrument data are averaged into 1 min in-
tervals for model comparison, with a horizontal resolution of
about 8 km at cruise speed.

LOAC
Finally, we also use data from LOAC (Light Optical Particle
Counter) instruments (Renard et al., 2015) collected during
TRAQA. LOAC is a light aerosol optical counter measur-
