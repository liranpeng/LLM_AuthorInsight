sions, surface ozone is a maximum in mid- to high northern
latitudes, amounting to 30â€“50 ppbv on a zonal and annual
mean. Monthly-mean distributions (not shown) show max-

season in the polluted regions of the North-Eastern United

emissions, and over Central Africa connected with biomass
burning.
