Future (2010–2100) CH4 and CH4 lifetime
We now apply the parametric model to predict methane and
methane lifetime, with their uncertainties, for a future so-
cioeconomic scenario. We make predictions for RCP 8.5 (Ri-
ahi et al., 2007), a scenario with rapid climate warming, but
these methods apply to other scenarios as well. The pre-
