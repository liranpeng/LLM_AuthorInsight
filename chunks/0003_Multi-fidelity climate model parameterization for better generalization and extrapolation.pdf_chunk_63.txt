approach can extrapolate heat and moisture convection pre-
dictions over substantial climate warming situations, where
existing supervised (single-fidelity) methods struggle. The im-
provement includes even the tropics where convection stochas-
ticity is higher compared to other regions and where different
Earth system models exhibit many typical problems related
to sub-grid convection parameterizations. We also verified
that the proposed multifidelity-RPN uncertainty quantification
