Summary
Advances in climate model development mean that for
CMIP6 a larger set of climate models will include interactive
simulation of aerosols than at the time of CMIP5, and many
will include interactive chemistry of the troposphere and/or
stratosphere. AerChemMIP has therefore been designed to
quantify the effects of these NTCFs and reactive WMGHGs
on climate and also on atmospheric composition and surface
air quality.
