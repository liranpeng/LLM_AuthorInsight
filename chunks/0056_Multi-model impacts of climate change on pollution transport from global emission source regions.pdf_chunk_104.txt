in tropopause height (Holzer and Boer, 2001). At the same
time, a reduced vertical gradient may also reï¬‚ect an overall
increase in eddy mixing associated with the upward and pole-
ward shifts in zonal-mean winds (Wu et al., 2011). Similar
transport responses to GHG-induced changes in eddy mix-
ing have been documented in other studies (Orbe et. al. 2015;
Abalos et al., 2017). Since changes in eddy mixing near the
tropopause are also linked to changes in tropopause height,
