Convective ﬂuxes and cloud optical depths for water and
ice clouds, as diagnosed in ECMWF meteorology, vary an-
nually by 2 % and have small sensitivity (−0.03 to +0.01),
so these factors have very little impact on τCH4×OH (≪1%).
Due to the small impact in the UCI CTM, these perturba-
tion tests are not repeated in the other CTMs. Our results are
consistent with the known decrease in mass-weighted global
OH concentrations due to clouds (Voulgarakis et al., 2010)
