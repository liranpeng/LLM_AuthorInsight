ECMWF operational data (Hauglustaine et al., 2004).
The NMHC setup of the LMDz-INCA model was used.
It considers detailed tropospheric chemistry with a com-
prehensive representation of the photochemistry of non-

pounds (VOC) from biogenic, anthropogenic, and biomass
burning sources.
Most anthropogenic emissions were taken from the
