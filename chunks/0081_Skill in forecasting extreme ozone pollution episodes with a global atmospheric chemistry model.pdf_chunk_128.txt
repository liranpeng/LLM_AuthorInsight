where the weight for each time index is the areal extent of
the episode on that day. This method reduces the effect of
the tails of the episode (early and late days with few events),
providing a more robust measure of the duration of extreme
pollution. The mean daily areal extent is simply the total size
divided by the duration. Finally, we deﬁne the mean episode
size, ( ¯S), over a given time frame (e.g., individual years, full
decade) as the weighted geometric mean of AQX episodes:
¯S = exp
