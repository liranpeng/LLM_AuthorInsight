the peak extends to June, and the minimum occurs much
earlier in September–October. The SH ﬂux generally has the
opposite phase to the NH ﬂux, but here the two models sep-
arate in phase by about 4 months. None of these phase dif-
ferences can be accounted for by differences in the methods.
The shaded area about each line represents the ±1 SD about
the multi-year daily average, and both models have similar
year-to-year variability. Values here, ∼400 Tg O3 yr−1, fall
