pattern gives a level of detail that helps us identify possible
sources of model error.
The winter domain model bias of the average O3
(MB = CTM minus observation (OBS), Fig. 6a–b) is
+19 ± 6 ppb (standard deviation across the grid cells) for the
US and +18 ± 5 ppb for EU. The high-latitude background
air (northern EU, upper Midwest US) has only a small bias
(5–15 ppb); but air coming in from the mid-latitude oceans
(east and west coast US, southern EU) has a higher bias (20–
