get of 350 ppm the required extraction is 328 ppm, not 547â€“
350 = 197 ppm. The well-known reason (Cao and Caldeira,
2010) is that ocean outgassing increases and vegetation pro-
ductivity and ocean CO2 uptake decrease with decreasing at-
mospheric CO2, as explored in a wide range of Earth system
models (Jones et al., 2016).

that change, must address various uncertainties. One useful
