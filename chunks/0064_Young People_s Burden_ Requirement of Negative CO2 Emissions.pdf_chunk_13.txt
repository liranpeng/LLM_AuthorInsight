We advocate pursuit of this goal within a century to limit
the period with global temperature above that of the cur-
rent interglacial period, the Holocene.1 Limiting the period
and magnitude of temperature excursion above the Holocene
range is crucial to avoid strong stimulation of slow feed-
backs. Slow feedbacks include ice sheet disintegration and
thus sea level rise, which is probably the most threatening
climate impact, and release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) via
