rology, which has been degraded to 2◦× 2.5◦and 47 layers
for the CTM. GEOS-5 data are available only after 2004,
however, so we also simulate 1997–2009 using MERRA
meteorology at 4◦× 5◦and 47 layers. Temporal resolution
in GEOS-5 (MERRA) is 6 h (3 h) for most meteorological
quantities and 3 h (1 h) for surface quantities and mixing
depth.
The tropospheric chemistry mechanism in GEOS-Chem,
as recently updated by Mao et al. (2010), consists of 104
