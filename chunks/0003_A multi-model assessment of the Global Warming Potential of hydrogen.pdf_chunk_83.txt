spheric production and loss, but soil sink and emissions are not needed in the
simulations, as the hydrogen at the surface is prescribed. The models do diagnose
the soil sink (see Model descriptions below), and this loss in addition to the
atmospheric loss is used to calculate the lifetime in the models and hence the
estimated ï¬‚ux of hydrogen in the simulations.
The radiative forcing in the PERT_H2 experiment can then be normalized by
