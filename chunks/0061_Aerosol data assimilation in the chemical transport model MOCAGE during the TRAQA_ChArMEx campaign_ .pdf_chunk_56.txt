as a possible underestimation of AOD in the model, and this
is taken into account in the covariance matrices error deﬁ-
nitions. Therefore, the possibly smaller AOD values of the
background are compensated by a higher percentage for the
error of the model. In addition, it is considered that it is better
to have overestimated errors in the matrix B than vice versa
(Talagrand, 2003).
