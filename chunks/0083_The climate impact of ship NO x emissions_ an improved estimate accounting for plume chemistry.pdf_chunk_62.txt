studies with small absolute magnitudes that were clearly re-
lated to unjustiﬁed modeling assumptions. Early work by
Lee et al. (2007) used CH4 and O3 sensitivities to land
NOx emissions, rather than ship-speciﬁc sensitivities that
tend to be higher. The ship emission inventory used by one
multi-model study (Eyring et al., 2007) was subsequently
