temperature (Marcott and Shakun, 2015).
We emphasize that comparisons of current global temper-
ature with the earlier Holocene must bear in mind the cen-
tennial smoothing inherent in the Holocene data (Marcott et
al., 2013). Thus, the temperature in an anomalous single year
such as 2016 is not an appropriate comparison. However, the
temperature in 2016 based on the 1970–present linear trend
(at least 1 ◦C relative to the 1880–1920 mean) does provide a
