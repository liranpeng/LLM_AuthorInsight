Figure 3. Mean proﬁles of reactivity (rows: P-O3, L-O3, L-CH4 in ppb/d) in three domains (columns: C. Paciﬁc, 30◦S–30◦N by 180–210◦E;
E. Paciﬁc, 0–30◦N by 230–250◦E; Atlantic, 30◦S–30◦N by 326–343◦E). Air parcels are cosine(latitude)-weighted. ATom-1 (gray) results
are from Fig. 2, while model results are taken from the August climatologies in Prather et al. (2017).
