episodes. Prior Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios (SRES) allowed
unconstrained growth, whereas the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios
assume uniformly an aggressive reduction, of air pollutant emissions. New estimates from the
current generation of chemistryâ€“climate models with RCP emissions thus project improved air
