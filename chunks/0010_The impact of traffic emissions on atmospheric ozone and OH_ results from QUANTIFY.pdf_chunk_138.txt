lifetime by OH oxidation is shortest also due to the high tem-
peratures.
Both factors are also the reason for the smaller effects
of road and aircraft emissions on OH and on the methane
lifetime, since they occur in higher latitudes and altitudes
where annual mean OH concentrations and temperatures are
lower.

Sensitivity of OH production
From Fig. 10 it is evident that ship emissions strongly affect
the still relatively clean regions mostly in the tropics, but also
