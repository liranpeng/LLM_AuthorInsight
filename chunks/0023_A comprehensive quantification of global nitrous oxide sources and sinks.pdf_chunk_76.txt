observation networks: AGAGE, NOAA, and CSIRO. Top-down anthropogenic 
emissions were calculated by subtracting natural fluxes derived from 
bottom-up approaches. To aid the comparison, the four RCPs were shifted 
down so that the 2005 value is equal to the 2000–2009 average of the mean of 
top-down and bottom-up estimates. The SSPs are harmonized3 to match the 
historical emissions used in CMIP649; Extended Data Fig. 10 shows the 
unharmonized data.
