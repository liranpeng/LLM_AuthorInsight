The horizontal extent of convection
To distinguish narrow from wide convective structures, it is necessary to separate convective updrafts based on 
their width. To elucidate these differences, we measure the Turbulent Length Scale (TLS)56, which is a way to 
derive the horizontal breadth of the updrafts. We calculate the TLS at each vertical level and then combine the
