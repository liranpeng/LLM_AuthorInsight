N2O driven only by stratospheric loss. The comparison with observations is limited here, as we did not 
model surface emissions, and we rely on comparisons with the more extensive study of the annual N2O 
cycle by Nevison et al. (2004). We conclude in Section 5 with a discussion of how this work can provide an 
innovative model-measurement STE test.
The overall goal of developing more accurate quantification of STE here is to derive a best estimate of the
