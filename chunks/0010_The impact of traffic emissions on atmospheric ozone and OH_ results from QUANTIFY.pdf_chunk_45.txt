els around 1 ppbv. At NOx levels of 0.1–0.3 ppbv, which are
typical for this region, PO3 and thus the scaled ozone pertur-
bation is more sensitive to a small decrease of NOx than for
a total removal of the aircraft NOx source.
In contrast, the average effect of road trafﬁc is of opposite
sign. As will be shown below its effect on ozone in the upper
troposphere can be quite substantial. Since road trafﬁc emis-
sions largely occur over the continents in regions with high
