ity. Natural and managed ecosystems provide a large frac-
tion of the methane and nitrous oxide emissions, and also
emit aerosol and ozone precursors (e.g. through emissions of
soil nitrogen oxides, biogenic volatile organic compounds,
and wildﬁres). These sources are likely to be affected by cli-
mate change, leading to a variety of feedbacks (Arneth et
al., 2010) that to date have only been quantiﬁed from a lim-
ited number of studies (and models) and thus there is a need
