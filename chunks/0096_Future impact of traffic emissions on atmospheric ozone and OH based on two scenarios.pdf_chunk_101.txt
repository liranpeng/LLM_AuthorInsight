pact on global OH concentrations, and consequently yields
the greatest relative change in CH4 lifetime with 5.3 %. The
largest change in the CH4 lifetime reduction between 2000
and 2050 is for AIR which will induce a 4.1 % shorter life-
time in the middle of the 21st century. Part of the increase
for AIR and SHIP is presumably caused by regional changes
in the emission distributions, with large increases at low lat-
itudes, which favours enhancements of OH concentrations.
