cubed-sphere grid in that it is made up of N ×N grid patches
stretched to ﬁt the sphere. Whereas the cubed-sphere uses
six square patches, our grid consists of two square patches,
one for each hemisphere, as shown in Fig. A1. For all
tests, we used 2N × N grids with resolutions in the range
N = (30,60,120,240,480,960), corresponding to angles
λ = 90/N = (3.0◦,1.5◦,0.75◦,0.375◦,0.1875◦,0.09375◦).
For the tests involving a minimum effective angle, we used
