200 years, respectively (Prather et al., 2012). The isotope fractionation factors for the OH, soil, stratosphere,
and chlorine sinks are 0.995, 0.980, 0.997, and 0.940, respectively (Lassey et al., 2007). The model solves the
mass balance equations for CH4, 12CH4, and 13CH4 and results are reported as CH4 mole fraction
(nmol mol−1) and δ13CH4 (per mil, ‰).
