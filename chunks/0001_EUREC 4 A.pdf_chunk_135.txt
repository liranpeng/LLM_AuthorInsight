features presumed to be the signature of mesoscale circula-
tions. Analyses of Meteor data show a signature of the diel
cycle (0.54 K), but it is more pronounced (1.27 K) over the
BCO – both at the surface and as sensed by the BCO lidar at
400 m. Both a slight slackening of the winds and an upwind
adjustment in response to diurnal heating of the island could
be responsible for the ampliﬁcation of the diel cycle over the
BCO.
Possible mesoscale circulations are the focus of the mag-
