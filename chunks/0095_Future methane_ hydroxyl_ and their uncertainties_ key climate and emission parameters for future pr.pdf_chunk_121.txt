have been estimated in past work to grow 5–50 % by the
late 21st century (Wu et al., 2008), but these predictions are
highly speculative due to poor mechanistic understanding of
present-day global ﬂash rates. GHG-driven climate warming
tends to reduce convection globally (Held and Soden, 2006),
but could intensify convection in some regions (Del Genio
et al., 2007), so the total effect on lightning is unclear. In
this work we assume 10 % increase by 2100, but allow broad
