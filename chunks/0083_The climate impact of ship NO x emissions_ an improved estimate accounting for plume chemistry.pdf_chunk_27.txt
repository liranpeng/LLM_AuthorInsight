a factor of 2 between wind speeds of 2 and 18 m sâˆ’1. Our
updated plume-in-grid parameterization depends on 8 mete-
orological and chemical factors: ambient concentrations of
NOx and O3, solar zenith angle at emission time and 5 h
later, photolysis rates of NO2 and O3, temperature, and wind
speed. Figure S2 in the Supplement shows how the parame-
terization responds to each of these factors. Clouds affect the
parameterized plume chemistry through photolysis rates, but
