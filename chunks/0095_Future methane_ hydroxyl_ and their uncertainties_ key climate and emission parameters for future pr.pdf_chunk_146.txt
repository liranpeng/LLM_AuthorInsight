CMIP5 recommendations, which are based on the MAGICC
model, but the uncertainty encompasses the difference. Our
projected change in methane lifetime is consistent with an
ensemble of GCMs containing atmospheric chemistry, pro-
viding further evidence that the parametric model includes
the key processes. Uncertainty in 2100 methane abundance is
10 % based on the processes we have assessed here, which in-
clude a simple treatment of natural methane emissions. Water
