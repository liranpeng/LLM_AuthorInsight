uncertainty but crucial to understand because vegetation acts
as both a source and a sink for many air pollutants (e.g.,
ref. 13 and 199). The attribution of O3 and PM air pollution
between ‘‘anthropogenic’’ and ‘‘biogenic’’ sources is compli-
cated by chemistry that involves both anthropogenic and
biogenic precursors for both O3 and aerosol,141,343 and by
land-use changes which alter biogenic sources (e.g., ref. 344
and 345). A major uncertainty regarding BVOC feedbacks is
