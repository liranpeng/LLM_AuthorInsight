While the CTM τCH4×OH anomalies are consistently within
the observational uncertainty for both the AGAGE and
NOAA networks (shaded region of Fig. 2), the year-to-
year changes in the models generally do not correlate with
the MCF data. Residual anthropogenic or ocean emissions
could account for some MCF decay anomalies, but only if
these emissions change abruptly from year to year. Emission
anomalies of about 4 Gg yr−1 would be required to cause the
