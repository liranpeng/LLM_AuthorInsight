3.3. Evaluating Emission Scenarios
The UCI‐CTM sensitivities were used to calculate the levels of acetylene and ethane over Greenland and
Antarctica for a variety of emission scenarios by summing over the various types of emissions multiplied
by the sensitivity of that emission type. In all scenarios, biofuel emissions of acetylene and ethane were ﬁxed
at 0.5 Tg year−1 (van Aardenne et al., 2001). The modeled Greenland and Antarctic acetylene and ethane
