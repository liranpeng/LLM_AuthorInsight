i=1Pi. We present results in which the panels are ei-
ther the quadrilaterals of a cubed-sphere mesh, or the tri-
angles of an icosahedral triangular mesh. The mesh corre-
sponds to a discretization of the Lagrangian parameter. The
scheme tracks two sets of particles, at the centers and vertices
of the panels, indexed by j = 1,...,M + N, where N is the
number of panels and M the number of vertices. Each par-
ticle has a Lagrangian parameter value, αj, position, xj(t),
