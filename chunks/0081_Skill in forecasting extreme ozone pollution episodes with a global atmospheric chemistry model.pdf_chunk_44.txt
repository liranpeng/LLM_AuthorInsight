cells adjacent to CONUS. For EU we draw a similar mask
but also include areas in the North Sea and in the Mediter-
ranean Sea west of Italy. We then calculate a measure of the
quality of prediction, QP, for the points within this desired
mask to determine the ﬁnal grid masks for the US and EU.
We deﬁne QP as the effective number of independent stations
at a distance of 100 km that went into the interpolation.
QP = 100β
