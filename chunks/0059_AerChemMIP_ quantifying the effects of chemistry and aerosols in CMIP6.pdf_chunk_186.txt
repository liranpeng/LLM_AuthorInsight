MIP will also provide information on climate feedbacks
by calculating the radiative effect of natural emissions of
aerosols or ozone precursors in the same way as ERFs of an-
thropogenic species. Combining these ERFs with diagnosed
changes in natural emissions from the DECK 1 % yr−1 CO2
(1pctco2) or 4×CO2 (abrupt4co2) simulations would give
the climate feedback parameters. AerChemMIP is therefore
key to understanding the behaviours of models with aerosols
