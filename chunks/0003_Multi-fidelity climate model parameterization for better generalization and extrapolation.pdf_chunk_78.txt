for the CAM5 +8K specific humidity across all pressure lev-
els considered compared to the CAM5 +4K dataset (figure 5).
Hence CAM5 +8K provides a broader extrapolation regime
due to the increased holding capacity of moisture in the at-
mosphere with climate change (Clausius-Clapeyron). CAM5
+8K also provides a clearer extrapolation for the heating ten-
dency than CAM5 +4K when compared to the high-fidelity
SPCAM5 historical run simulation (figure 5). Based on the
