P-O3. These rms values appear to be about as close as any
two models can get. The intra-model rms for different years
(UCI 2016 versus 1997) is 10 %–13 % and shows that we are
seeing basic differences in the chemical models across GC,
GMI and UCI. F0AM is the closest to the central models, but
it will inherently have a larger rms because it is a 1 d calcula-
tion and not a 5 d average. NCAR’s rms is consistently higher
and likely related to what is seen in the 5 d σ values in Ta-
