tially extensive network of stable water isotopologue mea-

2 O, and HDO) distributed across mul-
tiple platforms. Seven laser spectrometers and ﬁve precipi-
tation sampling systems especially designed to avoid post-
sampling re-evaporation were deployed. At the BCO, two
laser spectrometers provided robust high-frequency measure-
ments of isotopologues in water vapor and 46 event-based
precipitation samples were collected. Three ships – the R/V
