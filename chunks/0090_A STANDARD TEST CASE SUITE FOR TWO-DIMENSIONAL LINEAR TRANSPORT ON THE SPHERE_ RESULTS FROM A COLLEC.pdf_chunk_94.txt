preserving low-order Eulerian solution using an algorithm
that ensures mass conservation and shape preservation.
For comparison the scheme has also been run in an aliased,
and therefore unphysical, setup without the directional dif-
fusion (abbreviated HEL-ND; No Diffusion); thus, the La-
grangian parcels retain their initial values throughout the
simulation. If using exact trajectories, HEL-ND has no er-
rors at the end of the simulation since the parcels will have
