Reactivity across the models
The difference in modeled reactivities for each parcel com-
bines variations in cloud ﬁelds with basic differences in
the chemical models (i.e., chemical mechanisms, numerical
methods, photolysis treatment of cloudy and clear sky). The
5-day means reduce the effect of cloud variations but leave
the fundamental differences in the photochemical modules,
