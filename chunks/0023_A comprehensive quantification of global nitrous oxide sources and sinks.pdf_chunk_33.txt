models16 also suggest that recent climate change—particularly warm-
ing—could have boosted soil nitrification and denitrification processes, 
contributing to the growing trend in N2O emissions together with increas-
ing nitrogen additions to agricultural soils16,25–27 (Extended Data Fig. 8).
Regional N2O budgets (2007–2016)
Bottom-up approaches give estimates of N2O emissions in each of the 
five source categories, whereas top-down approaches provide only
