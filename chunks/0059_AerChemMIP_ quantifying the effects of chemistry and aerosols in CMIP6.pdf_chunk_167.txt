questions, some variables will be used to speciﬁcally help
to evaluate model performance. Testing model behaviour
against observations is critical for gaining conﬁdence in their
simulation of the historical past and predictions of the future.
The output requested refers to variables that have been ob-
served by different observational networks (based on ground-
based, balloon, aircraft or satellite sensors) over the recent
past. Comparison to these data will enable investigation of
