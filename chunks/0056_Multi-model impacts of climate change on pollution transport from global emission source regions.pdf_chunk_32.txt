the probability of a parcel being subject to convective trans-
port. Although these two parameterisations are based on
a mass ﬂux approach, there can be a wide spread in simu-
lated convective mass ﬂuxes within a single parameterisation
(Scinocca and McFarlane, 2004; Lamarque et al., 2013). In
addition, how the transport of the CO tracer is implemented
will inﬂuence the impacts of the convection schemes. The
simulations were performed using decadal-average monthly
