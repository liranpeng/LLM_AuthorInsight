Direct aerosol effect
The total global annual mean radiative forcing of the change
since 1990 in direct aerosol effect is shown in Fig. 3 for seven
models, together with the estimate given in IPCC AR5. The
model mean is very close to the IPCC AR5 value, but the
model spread is large. The model mean direct aerosol effect
