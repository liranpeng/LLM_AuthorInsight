[CH4] = 1.76 ppm is the global-mean CH4 mole fraction in
2000, f is the CH4 feedback factor that prolongs the life-
time of CH4 perturbations, S = 1.15 is the enhancement of
FCH4 due to CH4-derived stratospheric water vapor (Myhre
et al., 2007), and a = 0.34 Â± 0.13 describes the perturba-
tions to O3 abundance and RF that accompany global CH4
changes. The a term derives from a literature survey of mul-
tiple CTMs and radiative transfer models (see SI and Holmes
