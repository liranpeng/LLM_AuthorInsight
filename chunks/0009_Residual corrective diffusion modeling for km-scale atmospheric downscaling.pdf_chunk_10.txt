of ensemble members used to quantify uncertainties16.
A common inexpensive alternative is to learn a statistical
downscaling from these dynamical downscaling simulations and
observations17. This is typically done by learning the values of
several parameters of a statistical mapping (e.g. quantile mapping,
generalized linear regression) that best match a regional high
resolution data18. In this context, ML downscaling enters as an
advanced (non linear) form of statistical downscaling19 with
