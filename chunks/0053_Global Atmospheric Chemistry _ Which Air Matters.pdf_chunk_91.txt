calculated reactivities of that parcel. For example, the ba-
sic weight of a parcel (moles of air) can be scaled by P-O3
(ppb day−1), and the ﬁnal weight is the moles-O3 day−1. In
this case the sum of weighted parcels in a region gives the
moles of O3 produced per day in that region. These reac-
tivities can be calculated with A-runs for both models and
measurements. Thus, the modeled and measured probability
distributions reﬂect the parcels most important in determin-
