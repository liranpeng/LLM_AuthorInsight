and are expected to decrease in regions with increased
precipitation.186,241–246 Regional and seasonal changes in pre-
cipitation must be considered since global soluble aerosol
burdens do not typically scale with global precipitation
changes.98,247 Changes in mixing depths and ventilation of
the continental boundary layer also contribute to the sign of
the aerosol changes but are highly uncertain.7,219,222,248
Large feedbacks are possible from ‘‘natural’’ aerosol sources
