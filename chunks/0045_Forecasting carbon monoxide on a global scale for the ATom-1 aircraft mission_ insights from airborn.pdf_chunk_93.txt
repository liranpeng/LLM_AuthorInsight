Thus we might expect Indonesian biomass burning variabil-
ity to have a greater inﬂuence on CO variability during the
September–October season, which was sampled in ATom-3.
How does 2016 compare to previous years? The MOPITT
CO column shows tropical Atlantic CO was near the 75th
percentile, while the 700 hPa MOPITT level shows it close to
the median. This difference arises because the MOPITT col-
umn also includes information from the upper troposphere,
