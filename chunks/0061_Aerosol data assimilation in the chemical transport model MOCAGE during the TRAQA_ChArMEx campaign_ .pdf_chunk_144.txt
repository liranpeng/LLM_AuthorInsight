choice of the control variable is essential when the model
prognostic and the observed quantities differ as in the case
of AOD. The differences in our systems are the number of
bins to which the increment is repartitioned (11 bins for
Ô¨Åve species in Benedetti et al., 2009 and 24 bins for four
species in our system) and the assimilation method (4-D-
VAR against 3-D-FGAT). Benedetti et al. (2009) derived the
matrix B using the NMC (National Meteorological Center)
