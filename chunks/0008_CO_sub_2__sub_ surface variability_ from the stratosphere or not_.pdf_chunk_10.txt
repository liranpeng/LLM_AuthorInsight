gaps ﬁlled by ﬂask data at the same site. Only one point is interpolated (SMO, May 2015). CGO is ﬂask only. (b) The mean annual cycle
in surface CO2 (ppm) at four sites (BRW not shown) using 1985 through 2021 calculated from the residuals after the polynomial ﬁt was
removed. The eCO2 model results are shown as dotted lines for SMO and SPO with the same color coding; eCO2 has similar phasing at
