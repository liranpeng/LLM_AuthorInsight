of the chemistryâ€“climate interactions13 in Table 1. Below, we
review this recent work as well as studies considering only RF
from air pollutants.
The interactions between air pollutants and climate are
often studied in the context of future emission scenarios. For
projecting the future evolution of air quality under climate
change, the most widely used emission trajectories to date are
those described in the Special Report on Emission Scenarios
