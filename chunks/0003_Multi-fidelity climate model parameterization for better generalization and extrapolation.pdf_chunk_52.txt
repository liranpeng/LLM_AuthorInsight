warmer climates and hence the tropics (the warmest region
of the world) provide test data-points that are well outside
the training datasets distributions. In addition, the tropics is a
challenging region to model in terms of convection and ESMs
exhibit many typical problems within this region that are re-
lated to sub-grid convection parameterizations. Among these
problems we can mention the double inter-tropical conver-
gence zone (ITCZ)72, too much drizzle and missing precipita-
