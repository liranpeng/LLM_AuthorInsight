species as well as different patterns or locations of the most
reactive parcels. For example, we list the models’ average
reactivities for the tropical Paciﬁc and the globe in Table 1c.
The tropical Paciﬁc average P-O3 is similar across models
and is about 1/2 that of the global average, which is domi-
nated polluted, near-surface parcels over land. The L-O3 is
typically the same for the Paciﬁc and the globe; and the L-
CH4 is greater over the Paciﬁc than over the globe. Model
