al. (1979) concluded that equilibrium sensitivity, i.e., global
warming after a time sufﬁcient for the planet to restore en-
ergy balance with space, was 3 ± 1.5 ◦C for 2 × CO2 or
0.75 ◦C (W m−2)−1 forcing. The Charney analysis was based
on climate models in which ice sheets and all long-lived
GHGs (except for the speciﬁed CO2 doubling) were ﬁxed.
The climate sensitivity thus inferred is the “fast-feedback”
climate sensitivity. The central value found in a wide range
