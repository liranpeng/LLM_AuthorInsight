Opportunities and lessons learned
As a quick look at the opportunities provided by the ATom
data, we present an example based on the Wolfe et al. (2019)
study, which used the F0AM model and semi-analytical ar-
guments to show that troposphere HCHO columns (measur-
able by satellite and ATom) are related to OH columns (mea-
sured by ATom) and thus to CH4 loss. Figure 6 extends the
Wolfe et al. study using the individual air parcels and plot-
