below 4 km.
In Fig. 4, we also look at the histograms for the key HOx-
related species HOOH (third row) and HCHO (fourth row).
For these species, the ATom–model agreement is generally
good. If anything, the models tend to have too much HOOH.
ATom shows systematically large occurrences of low HOOH
(50–200 ppt, especially central Paciﬁc), indicating, perhaps,
that convective or cloud scavenging of HOOH is more effec-
tive than is modeled. HCHO shows reasonable agreement in
