Figure 8. Scatter plot of reactivities and J-values for 5d-mean air parcels for UCI alternate meteorological years (2015, 1997) against the
standard year 2016.
The GFDL and NCAR CCMs could not maintain the ﬁxed,
data-stream T and q values over the 24 h integration, which
leads to larger rms differences because reactivities depend
on both T and q. This explains in part why the GFDL and
