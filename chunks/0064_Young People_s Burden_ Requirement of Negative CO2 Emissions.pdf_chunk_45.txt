to a “Little Ice Age” minimum in the early 1800s (that mini-
mum being better deﬁned by higher resolution data of Abram
et al., 2016). Concatenation of the modern and Holocene
temperature records (Fig. 3; Appendix A5) assumes that
1880–1920 mean temperature is 0.1 ◦C warmer than the
Little Ice Age minimum (Abram et al., 2016). The early
Holocene maximum in the Marcott et al. (2013) data thus
reaches +0.5 ◦C relative to the 1880–1920 mean of modern
