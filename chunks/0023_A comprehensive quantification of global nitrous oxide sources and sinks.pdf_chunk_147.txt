burden and its rate of change during 1980–2016 were derived from 
mean maritime surface mixing ratios of N2O (refs. 78,79) with a conversion 
factor of 4.79 Tg N ppb−1 (ref. 80). Combining uncertainties in measuring 
the mean surface mixing ratios78 and that of converting surface mix-
ing ratios to a global mean abundance80, we estimate an uncertainty 
in the burden of ±1.4%. Annual change in atmospheric abundance is 
calculated from the combined NOAA and AGAGE record of surface
