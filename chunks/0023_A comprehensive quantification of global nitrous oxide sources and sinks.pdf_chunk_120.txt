quantified the contribution of natural sources to total emission from 
reservoirs, lakes and estuaries at 44% (36%–52%), with consideration of 
all nitrogen inputs (that is, inorganic, organic, dissolved and particulate 
forms). We combined the estimate from lightning with that from atmos-
pheric production into an integrated category denoted ‘Lightning 
and atmospheric production’. We make a simplification by consider-
ing the category ‘Lightning and atmospheric production’ as purely
