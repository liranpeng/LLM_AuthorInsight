lifetimes. The methane GWP customarily accounts for the
direct RF from the emitted gas, as well as indirect RF caused
by methane-induced increases in ozone, stratospheric water
vapor, and feedback on the methane lifetime (Forster et al.,
2007). Here we evaluate the methane GWP implied by the
perturbation experiments. Radiative forcing of methane and
ozone are calculated for the control simulation and a simula-
tion with 5 % more methane, using the University of Oslo ra-
