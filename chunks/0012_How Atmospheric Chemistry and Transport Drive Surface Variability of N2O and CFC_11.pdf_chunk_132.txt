of emissions. The annual cycle in stratospheric influx (hard to validate with observations) is modeled to be 
only slightly larger than the QBO pattern. In the NH, the models without emissions can match much of the 
observations. In the SH, the models have a much weaker annual cycle and differ in phasing when compared 
to the observations, indicating possible influence of seasonal transport and SH sources. Thus, we have confi-
