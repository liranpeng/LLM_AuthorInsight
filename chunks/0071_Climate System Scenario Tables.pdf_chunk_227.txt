Notes:
See Table 8.3, 8.A.1. ERF is calculated from AR5 radiative efficiency and projected abundances 
in Scenario A1 of WMO/UNEP assessment (WMO 2010). The 68% confidence interval shown is 
approximated by combining uncertainty in the radiative efficiency of each gas (±6.1%) and the 
decay of each gas since 2010 from Table AII.4.16 (±15%). All sources of uncertainty are assumed
