Identifying robust regional air pollution and climate responses
The northern mid-latitudes have garnered the most attention
in the literature in terms of air quality and climate interactions;
more work is needed to understand the future evolution of air
quality in the tropics and southern hemisphere. More reliable
projections of air quality require conÔ¨Ådence in the regional
climate responses, including precipitation, the positioning
