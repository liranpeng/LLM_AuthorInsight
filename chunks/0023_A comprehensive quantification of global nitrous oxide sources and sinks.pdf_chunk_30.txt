however, has been partly offset by an increase in soil N2O emissions 
attributed to the temporary increase in emissions after deforestation 
(the post-deforestation pulse effect) and to background emissions from 
converted croplands or pastures21 (see Methods; Extended Data Fig. 7).
From the ensemble of process-based land model emissions15,16, we esti-
mate a global agricultural soil emission factor of 1.8% (1.3%–2.3%), which
