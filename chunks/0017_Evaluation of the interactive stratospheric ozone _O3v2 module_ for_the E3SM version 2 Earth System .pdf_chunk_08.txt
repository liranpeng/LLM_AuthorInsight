mation for ozone. Ozone is a short-lived reactive gas, is not
directly emitted, has many sources and sinks in the atmo-
sphere, and maintains sharp gradients at dynamical bound-
aries. Running a detailed atmospheric chemistry model for
ozone, including both stratospheric and tropospheric chem-
ical regimes, within a climate model is costly, often pro-
hibitively so, and thus most climate simulations adopt a mean
climatological distribution of ozone based on present-day ob-
