cated further southward (∼20◦S) (Fig. 1). Thus, in summer
tropical convection is weakly co-located with biomass burn-
ing emissions, resulting in lower CO-tracer mixing ratios in
the tropical mid-troposphere as a whole and a more conﬁned
region of peak CO-tracer mixing ratios over Central Africa
(Fig. 5), compared to winter (Fig. 4). The inﬂuence of the
ITCZ position is also seen in the CO-tracer vertical gradient
(the ratio of the CO tracer relative to its value at the sur-
