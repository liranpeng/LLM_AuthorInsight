pseudo-observation in a unique grid cell according to its lat-
itude, longitude, and pressure. If another parcel is already
in that cell, then it is shifted east–west or north–south to a
neighboring model cell. For coarse-resolution models, mul-

to modify in order to try to match the local solar time of
