ﬁles of NOx(v2b), NOxﬁt(v3), and HOOH for the three tropi-
cal regions in Fig. 57. The central Paciﬁc is not much affected
by the v2b–v3 update, but the eastern Paciﬁc and tropical At-
lantic noticeably change. For Paciﬁc HOOH, we ﬁnd that the
1–5 km peak is mostly in the eastern Paciﬁc and thus relate
high levels of HOOH and related HOx activity to outﬂow
from continents.
The 2D curtain ﬁles for the Paciﬁc and Atlantic basins
show the level of heterogeneity in NOx for ATom-1234 in
