connected with straight lines to deﬁne the upstream La-
grangian area. Note that it is essential for mass conservation
that the upstream areas collectively span the entire domain
and that the reconstruction function integrates to the cell-
averaged value within each Eulerian grid cell (Erath et al.,
2013). Mass conservation in ﬂux-form schemes is not sub-
ject to these constraints.
The CSLAM scheme may also be cast in ﬂux form (Har-
ris et al., 2010) to produce schemes that are identical even
