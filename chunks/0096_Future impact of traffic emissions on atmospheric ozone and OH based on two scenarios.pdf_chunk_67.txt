For reference, the model mean and standard deviation of the
methane lifetime in the BASE simulation is 8.4 (± 1.1) yr for
2050 A1B compared to 8.3 (± 1.0) yr in 2000.
The sensitivity of OH to trafﬁc emissions is largest in re-
gions where the amounts of sunlight and water vapour are
high, and the background concentrations of ozone, NOx and
NMHCs are low. As discussed in Hoor et al. (2009) this leads
to the largest changes in methane lifetime for SHIP, which
