ous absorption is an ongoing effort (Etminan et al., 2016; Mlawer et al., 2012; Paynter & Ramaswamy, 2014; 
Pincus et al., 2015; Radel et al., 2015), but parallel efforts on cloud absorption are limited.
4.  Scattering Phase Functions and Multiple Scattering
Ideally, the sunlight scattered by clouds, aerosols and gases is resolved semi-continuously in all directions 
within the atmosphere, but in practice, RT solutions for solar heating keep track of a limited number of
