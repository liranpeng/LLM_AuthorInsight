ning emissions, and possibly further stratospheric ozone de-
pletion due to enhanced heterogeneous processing in a cool-
ing stratosphere. Climate change may also alter the general
circulation of the atmosphere and dynamical processes on
smaller scales, such as boundary layer ventilation, convec-
tion activity, and stratosphere-troposphere exchange. These
considerations suggest that climate change should be consid-
ered in model studies of ozone change over long periods of
time.
