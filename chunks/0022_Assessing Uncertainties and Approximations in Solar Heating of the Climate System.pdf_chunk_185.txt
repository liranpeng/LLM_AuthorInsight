light and 1.1 W m−2 less heating of the climate system (atmosphere and surface) than do spherical, 
refracting atmospheres (T1/R23&24). Errors can reach 4 W m−2 (monthly averages) at high latitudes. 
Spherical solar ray-tracing with refraction can and should be readily implemented with simple ray trac-
ing code (P2019) and incorporated in standard 2-stream codes (Spurr & Natraj, 2011). There will be
