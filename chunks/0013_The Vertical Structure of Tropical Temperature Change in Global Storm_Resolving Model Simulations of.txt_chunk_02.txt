Global storm‐resolving model (GSRM) simulations (kilometer‐scale horizontal resolution) of the atmosphere can capture the interaction between the scales of deep cumulus convection and the large‐scale dynamics and thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere. Here, we assess the vertical structure of tropical temperature change in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's GSRM X‐SHiELD, perturbed by a uniform sea surface temperature (SST) warming and/or increased CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ concentration.
