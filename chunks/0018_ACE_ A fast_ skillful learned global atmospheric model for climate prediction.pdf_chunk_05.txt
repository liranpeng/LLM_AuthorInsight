moisture and momentum must be predicted to enable assessment of climate sensitivity and coupling
with other components such as the ocean. Appropriate forcings should be used—e.g. sea surface
temperature (SST) in the case of an atmosphere-only model. Its long-term averages should be
unbiased compared to a reference dataset. Finally, the model’s performance must generalize across a
broad range of plausible SST distributions and CO2 concentrations.
