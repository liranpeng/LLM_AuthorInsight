Model calibration
Analysis of the ensemble spread of our 32-member CorrDiff
predictions shows they are not yet optimally calibrated. Figure 2
demonstrates that the predictions are overall under-dispersive for
most channels – the ensemble spread is too small relative to
ensemble mean error and rank histograms indicate that observed
values frequently fall above or below the range of predicted values.
