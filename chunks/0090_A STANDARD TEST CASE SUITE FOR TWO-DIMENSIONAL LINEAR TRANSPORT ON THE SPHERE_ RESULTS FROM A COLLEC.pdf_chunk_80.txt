when the slope limiter for shape preservation is applied.
Note that casting the scheme in ﬂux form allows for ﬂux
limiters such as FCT that can obviously not be used in
the Lagrangian form (e.g., Lauritzen et al., 2011b). Since
CSLAM integrates over fewer overlap areas than its ﬂux-
form version, it is more efﬁcient in its Lagrangian form. The
CSLAM version used in this comparison was implemented
on an equiangular gnomonic cubed-sphere grid. CSLAM
