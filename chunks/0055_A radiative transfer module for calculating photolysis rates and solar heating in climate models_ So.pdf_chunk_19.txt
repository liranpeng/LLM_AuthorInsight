this problem, a commonly used delta-scaling technique is
applied by removing the large forward-scattering peak, thus
reducing the optical depth (Joseph et al., 1976; Wiscombe,
1977). In addition, the Henyey–Greenstein (HG) phase func-
tion (Henyey and Greenstein, 1941) is often used to tune
the two-stream scattering to better represent the scattering of
large particles for speciﬁc sun angles. Unfortunately, the HG
phase function lacks the realistic back-scattering peak found
