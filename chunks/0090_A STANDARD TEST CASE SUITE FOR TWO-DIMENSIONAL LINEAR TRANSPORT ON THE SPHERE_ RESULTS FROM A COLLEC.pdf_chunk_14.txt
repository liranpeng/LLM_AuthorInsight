Despite the high degree of deformation in the (moving)
vortex test problem, in particular when simulated beyond
the original speciﬁcation of simulation length (Kent et al.,
2012; Pudykiewicz, 2011), it has an analytical solution. The
“boomerang” ﬂows, on the other hand, do not have easily
accessible analytical solutions until the end of the speci-
ﬁed simulation time. Contrary to most idealized tracer trans-
port test cases, Nair and Lauritzen (2010) proposed a di-
