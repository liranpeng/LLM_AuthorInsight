to the known structure of the lower troposphere, i.e., near
the surface, in the middle, near the top, and just above the
sub-cloud layer, as well as in and just above the cloud layer.
Past studies using a single aircraft, albeit in a more homo-

close boundary layer moisture and energy budgets (Stevens
et al., 2003). Doing so also aids quantiÔ¨Åcation of the verti-
