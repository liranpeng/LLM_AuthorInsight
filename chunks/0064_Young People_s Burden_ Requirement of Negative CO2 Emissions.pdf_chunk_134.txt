This leads to mean stratospheric aerosol climate forcing of
−0.3 W m−2 for remainder of the 21st century, similar to
the mean stratospheric aerosol forcing for 1850–2015 (Ta-
ble A10). Reconstruction of historical solar forcing (Cod-
dington et al., 2016; Kopp et al., 2016), based on data in
Fig. A11, is extended with an 11-year cycle.
Individual and net climate forcings for the several fossil
fuel emission reduction rates are shown in Fig. 11a and c.
