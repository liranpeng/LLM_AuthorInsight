Mao et al., 2009) is primarily determined by the longer-lived
reactive species listed here, which can be derived from the
key species, but it is not really a product of the 3-D mod-
els. Effectively, L-OH provides a climatology of a weighted
basket of species. The models’ predicted L-OH using their
own key species could be tested with the L-OH observations,
but then we are just testing the model’s key species and our
direct comparisons are more useful. Actinic ﬂuxes and thus
