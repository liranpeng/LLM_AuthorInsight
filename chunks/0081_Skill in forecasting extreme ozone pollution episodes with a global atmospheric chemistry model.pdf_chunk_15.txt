year, and pollution level by comparing different percentiles at
each grid cell while maintaining exact-day matches (concur-
rent sampling) over the 2 years. Simple comparison of high-
and low-end statistics of the ozone distribution is found to
be misleading. In Sect. 4 we deﬁne extreme pollution events
for each grid cell in a climatological sense, as the 100 worst
days (i.e., highest MDA8 concentrations) in a decade (∼97.3
percentile) or the 20 worst days in 2 years when comparing
