Here the models were still nearly all ofﬂine chemistry trans-
port models, and none of the climate models used in AR4
(those participating in the CMIP3 project) included tropo-
spheric ozone chemistry. The radiative forcing of ozone in all
cases was calculated using ofﬂine radiative transfer models,
usually for “pre-industrial”, “present” and one or two future
time slices. It was not until the CMIP5 project that a few of
the climate models included interactive tropospheric chem-
