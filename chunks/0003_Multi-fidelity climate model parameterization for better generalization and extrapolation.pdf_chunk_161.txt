variations show a better performance overall for the SF-HF-RPN model compared to the deterministic NN. mostly for the
vertical level 494 hPa, while the improvement for the two other vertical levels is mainly limited to the second half of the testing
period of a year.
The seasonality effect on the models performance is not quite trivial. We remind that the SF-HF-RPN and deterministic NN.
