Here, we present new estimates of the GWP100 of hydrogen,
using
ﬁve
global
atmospheric
chemistry
models
(GFDL,
OsloCTM, INCA, WACCM, and UKCA). We calculate GWP100
using a steady-state perturbation approach that takes all effects of
atmospheric hydrogen into account in a comprehensive way. The
models are forced by present-day (2010) hydrogen and methane
surface concentrations. As idealized experiments, we perturb
