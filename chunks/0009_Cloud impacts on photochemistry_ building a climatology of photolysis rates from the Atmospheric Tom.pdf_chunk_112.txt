CAFS measurement. Work on the CAFS / TUV calibration
seeks to achieve this zero bias, and it continues beyond the
cutoff date of the ATom-1 data used here. The OSA affects
our 2 Js differently: for J-O1D with peak photolysis about
305 nm, the OSA under typical conditions (SZA = 20◦, sur-
face wind = 10 m s−1, chlorophyll = 0.05 mg m−3) is 0.038,
while for J-NO2 with peak photolysis at 380 nm, the OSA is
0.048. OSA depends critically on the incident angle of radi-
