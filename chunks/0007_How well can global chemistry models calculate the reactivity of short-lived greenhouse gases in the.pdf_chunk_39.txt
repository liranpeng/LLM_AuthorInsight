rectly or simply into reactivities, where GISS L-O3 is higher
(expected) but L-CH4 is lower (unexpected). For J-NO2,
model differences are not so great and show largest values at
20–50◦N consistent with the longer summer daytime hours.
The spread in J-NO2 is partly understandable because of
ambiguous choices in interpolating the temperature depen-
dence of recommended NO2 cross sections and quantum
yields (i.e., the absorption cross sections are given at 220
