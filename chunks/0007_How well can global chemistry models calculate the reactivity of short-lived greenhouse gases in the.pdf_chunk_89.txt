UCI model are almost identical (< 1 %), while the differences
across the three reference models are much larger (±5 %) and
clearly distinguishable.
How the time-of-day of parcels in the data stream might
affect reactivity is tested with the UCI model initializing
the calculation at midnight (12:00 UT) instead of noon (see
Fig. S8, Table S8). In this study, we chose parcels at 180◦W
and, since the global models begin each day at 00:00 UT,
