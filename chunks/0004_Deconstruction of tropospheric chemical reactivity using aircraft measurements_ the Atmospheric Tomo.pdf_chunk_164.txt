Figures 61–64 show the PDs of CO (ppb), O3 (ppb), rela-
tive humidity over water (RHw, %), and NOx (log(ppt)) for
the tropical ocean regions (central Paciﬁc, eastern Paciﬁc,
tropical Atlantic). The PDs are calculated for the lower tropo-
sphere (0–6 km) and the full ATom-sampled troposphere (0–
12 km). For the ﬁrst three quantities, the legend for each de-
ployment lists the mean value, standard deviation, and skew-
