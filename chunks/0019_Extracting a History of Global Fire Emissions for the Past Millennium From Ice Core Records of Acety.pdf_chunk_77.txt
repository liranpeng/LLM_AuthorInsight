ﬁres, and the boreal burning emissions must be allowed to vary independently in order to simulate the dif-
ferent trends in Greenland and Antarctic ice cores (Nicewonger et al., 2018, 2020). In contrast, Antarctic
acetylene and ethane exhibits very low sensitivity to boreal burning emissions. Antarctic ice core records
of acetylene and ethane primarily reﬂect tropical burning, which comprises the bulk of global biomass burn-
