(plume plus grid chemistry, right panels). Values are shown from the
CTM with parametric plume chemistry only where ship NOx emis-
sions exceed 104 molec m−2 s−1. Inset numbers give global aver-
ages.

Figure 2 shows simulated, time-averaged OPE of ship NOx
with parametric plume chemistry. OPE is deﬁned here as
1P(Ox)/1L(NOx), where P(X) and L(X) are the time-
integrated production and loss of species X, Ox is the odd
