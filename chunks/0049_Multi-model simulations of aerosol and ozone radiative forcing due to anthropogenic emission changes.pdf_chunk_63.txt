is partly due to their use of a constant CH4 value in the
trend calculations. Quantifying the contribution from the var-
ious individual ozone precursors is complicated due to non-
linearity (Stevenson et al., 2013).

Summary and conclusions
A suite of models simulated ozone and aerosol forcing over
the 1990â€“2015 period, using new emission data from the Eu-
ropean Union project ECLIPSE (Stohl et al., 2015). In areas
where there are good and harmonised measurement networks
