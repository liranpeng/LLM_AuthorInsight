restrict these comparisons to high sun, cos(SZA) > 0.8, to re-
duce 3-D effects that are not modeled here, which leaves
11 504 (block 1) and 4867 (block 2) measurements for the
CAFS / TUV 3 s averages. For the models, the number of
hourly samples with cos(SZA) > 0.8 is about 18 % for both
blocks and thus the number of samples depends on model
resolution (e.g., 240 000 for UCI and 1 400 000 for NCAR in
block 1). Although the analysis here is limited to the PaciÔ¨Åc
