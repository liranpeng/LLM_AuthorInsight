molecules per cm2), AOD (mean aerosol optical depth at 550 nm), ERF 
(effective radiative forcing, W mâ€“2), and other climate system quantities 
are calculated for scenarios using methodologies based on the latest 
climate chemistry and climate carbon models (see Chapters 2, 6, 7, 
8, 10, 11 and 12). Results are shown for individual years (e.g., 2010 
= year 2010) and decadal averages (e.g., 2020d = average of years 
2016 through 2025), although some 10-year periods are different, see
