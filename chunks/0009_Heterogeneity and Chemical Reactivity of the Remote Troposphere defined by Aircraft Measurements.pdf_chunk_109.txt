this amount. The ATom statistics indicate a lightning source
must be vertically mixed. In the eastern Paciﬁc, the ATom
0–4 km troposphere appears again to have large amounts of
air with 20–50 ppt, while the full troposphere more closely
matches the models, except for the large occurrence of air
with 100–300 ppt NOx. These high-NOx upper troposphere
regions are probably direct outﬂow from very deep convec-
tion with lightning in the monsoon regions over Mexico at
