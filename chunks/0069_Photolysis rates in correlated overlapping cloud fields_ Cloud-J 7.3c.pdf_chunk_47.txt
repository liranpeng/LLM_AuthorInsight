are large, indicating that 640 different FCAs produce cancel-
ing errors in the mean. The rms errors for G0 and G3 are
worrisome: more than 15 % in the boundary layer and 5 to
11 % in the full troposphere. The G6 errors are almost linear
with the cc value. The G6/.99 with highly correlated overlap
is similar to G3 which has MAX overlap throughout most
of the atmosphere. The G6/.00 with random overlap is the
closest to the correlated model G6/0.33.
