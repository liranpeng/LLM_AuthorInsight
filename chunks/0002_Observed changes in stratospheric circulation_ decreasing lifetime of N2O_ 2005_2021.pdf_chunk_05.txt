around the mid latitudes (Plumb and Mahlman, 1987; Neu
and Plumb, 1999; Butchart, 2014). Observational metrics
for an enhanced BDC are based on trends in the age of
air (AoA) using surrogate gases such as SF6. While mod-
els predict an enhanced BDC, the SF6 observations indi-
cate an unchanged or decreasing BDC but with large uncer-
tainty (Karpechko et al., 2018; Abalos et al., 2021; Garney
et al., 2022). The comparison of models and measurements
