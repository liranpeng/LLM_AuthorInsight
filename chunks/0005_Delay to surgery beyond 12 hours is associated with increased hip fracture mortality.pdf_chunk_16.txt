variables remained significant on multivariate analysis 
(Fig. 3). The odds of 30-day mortality for delay to surgery 
from time of fall were 1.550 (CI 1.026–2.459, p = 0.048) at 
the 12 h threshold (Table 5). This was also not significant at 
any other time threshold (Table 6).
Discussion
National mortality rates for elderly patients with hip frac-
tures have varied considerably in recent years [1], partly as a 
result of widespread covid-19 infection[27–30] and changes
