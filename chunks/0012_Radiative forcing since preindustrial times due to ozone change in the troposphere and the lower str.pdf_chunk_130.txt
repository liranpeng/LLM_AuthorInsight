The
University of Oslo and University of Reading radiative trans-
fer models use their respective model meteorologies for all
calculations, so that differences within a set of RF results
from the same radiative transfer model are entirely due to
differences in the modeled ozone changes.
3.1
Radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone change
The University of Oslo radiative transfer model (“UiO-
RTM”) is the same as was used in Berntsen et al. (1997),
