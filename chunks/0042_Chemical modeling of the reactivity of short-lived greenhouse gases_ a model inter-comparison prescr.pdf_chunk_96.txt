ing T and q’s reported from the GFDL and NCAR models.
The rms reactivity differences for these two models are 2–3
times larger than those of the reference models (GSFC, GC,
UCI, see Table 3); while J-value differences (much less af-
fected by temperature) are similar.
For the ﬁve days, each with 14 880 parcels, the mean val-
ues of either GFDL or NCAR T and q’s are similar to the
data stream but their rms differences are large: about 3.6◦K
