ric approaches, which are shown in Fig. 5, that produce zero
or positive trends over the same period (Prather et al., 2001;
Meinshausen et al., 2011a).
Figure 6 identiﬁes the contribution of each variable to the
total change in τCH4×OH. Rising atmospheric methane has the
largest inﬂuence on τCH4×OH, but the positive methane feed-
back effect (3.5 %) is more than compensated by negative
climate and emission terms. Temperature and water vapor,
which have increased due to GHGs, decrease τCH4×OH by
