of the true multi-modal posterior distribution when applied to
deep learning frameworks56. In addition, it has been shown
that dropout and standard deep ensemble methods often pro-
vide minimal uncertainty estimates which prevents their use
in applications requiring sufficiently accurate approximation
of posterior distributions56,57.
Randomized Prior Networks (RPNs)58 were developed in
order to provide a compromise between acceptable computa-
