O2 photolysis wrongly reduces the net STE into the troposphere, biasing the net STE to lower values. This
sometimes does not show up in the LS sequence (C29 NH), but in other cases, the LMS domain has similar
biases. The use of an O3 isosurface is thus not preferred. In the NH, but not SH, seasonal amplitude (S-rms) is
larger for e90 than either O3 surface and truly reï¬‚ects the seasonality of STE.
