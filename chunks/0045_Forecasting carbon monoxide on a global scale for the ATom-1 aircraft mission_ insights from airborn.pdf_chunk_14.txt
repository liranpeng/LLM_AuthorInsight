and place of ATom-1 measurements Ô¨Åt into a global, multi-
year climatology of CO. In particular, we assess the extent to
which measurements from the ATom-1 period represent the
CO and aerosol distributions over the last decade and a half.
In this study, we place the August 2016 ATom observations
in the context of interannual variability and assess the contri-
butions of different emission sources to the various regions
sampled during the campaign. We focus on CO, a tracer of
