ozone change obtained in this study. However, the radiative
forcing in the Harvard-GISS “tuned” model is considerably
larger, pointing to the uncertainty in modeled ozone change
since preindustrial times.

Conclusions and outlook
In this analysis ozone changes in the troposphere and lower
stratosphere calculated by seven CCMs and three CTMs for
the period 1850–2000 have been used to calculate radiative
forcing. The CCMs have calculated both chemical and cli-
