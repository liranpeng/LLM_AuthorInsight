based on previously established experience with O2 and O3
cross sections and the need to calculate accurate J values.
We accept that RRTMG-SW and its parent code RRTM rep-
resent current best practice and accuracy in characterizing
the absorption of infrared sunlight (0.8 to 12 µm) in the
Earth’s atmosphere and have adopted the RRTMG-SW code
exactly for bins and all gaseous absorbers. Solar-J’s compu-
