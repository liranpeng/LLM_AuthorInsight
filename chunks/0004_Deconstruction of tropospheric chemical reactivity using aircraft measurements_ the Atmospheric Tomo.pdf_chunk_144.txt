basins and ATom-1234 shown in each panel. The solid col-
ored lines are calculated for one day with v3 NOxﬁt, and the
dashed colored lines are calculated for v2b NOx. For P-O3,
the difference is visible at different altitudes for ATom-234,
but the proﬁle shape is clearly changed for ATom-3 Paciﬁc
10–12 km and ATom-2 Atlantic 0–2 km. Remembering that
only NOx changes here with v3 and that P-O3 has the high-
est sensitivity to NOx, we expect the other reactivities (L-O3,
