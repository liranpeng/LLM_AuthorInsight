the scientiﬁc community for IPCC (2013). This is not a lim-
itation for the past, i.e., for the period 1850–present, because
we employ measured GHG changes, which include any GHG
change due to slow feedbacks. Also, we know that ice sheets
did not change signiﬁcantly in size in that period; there may
have been some change in Greenland’s albedo and expansion
of forests in the Northern Hemisphere (Pearson et al., 2013),
but those feedbacks so far have only a small global effect.
