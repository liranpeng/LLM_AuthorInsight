centrations consistent with ﬁeld observations over several
hours of ship plume aging (Chen et al., 2005).
In this work, we update the Gaussian plume model to
calculate CH4 oxidation within the ship plume and verify
that the updated model still reproduces ﬁeld observations of
NOx, O3, and OH concentrations (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
ment). We also add wind speed as a factor in the look-up
table, since CH4 oxidation and O3 production can vary by
