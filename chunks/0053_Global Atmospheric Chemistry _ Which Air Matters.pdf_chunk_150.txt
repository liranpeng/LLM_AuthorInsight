tochemical module by using A-runs with the same string of
simulated measurements, is underway.
The multi-model comparison has provided a range of sci-
entiﬁc results:
– All six models show distinctly different reactivity pro-
ﬁles in the Paciﬁc basin, with model–model differences
much larger than the A-run and C-run differences; mod-
els that look similar in one reactivity can appear differ-
ent in another (e.g., L-CH4 in B and C vs. L-O3).
