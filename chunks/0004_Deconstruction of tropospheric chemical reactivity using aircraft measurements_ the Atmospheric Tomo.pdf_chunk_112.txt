have a much smaller range than in the Paciﬁc and Atlantic basin plots. Troposphere-only parcels are shown, with the stratosphere deﬁned as
H2O < 30 ppm, O3 > 80 ppb, and CO < 120 ppb. See Fig. 6.
for the lifetime of O3 perturbations is discussed with chemi-
cal feedbacks in Sect. 6.

Second-order terms
Considering that most chemical reactions are of the forms
R = k(T )XY or k(T )X2, we should evaluate the second-
order terms in the Taylor expansion. We ﬁrst tested the
