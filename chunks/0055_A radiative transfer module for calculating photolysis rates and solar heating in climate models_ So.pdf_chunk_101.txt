agation to the high latitudes (Hsu et al., 2013). At high lat-
itudes, RRTMG error is in the opposite direction, resulting
in a colder polar stratosphere with possibly stronger winter
vortices.
Solar-J traces the solar beam through a spherical atmo-
sphere back to the sun. RRTMG assumes a ﬂat Earth. Both
then calculate the subsequent scattering and absorption in
a plane-parallel, ﬂat atmosphere, but with different solar
source terms at each level. Solar-J is able to simulate both
