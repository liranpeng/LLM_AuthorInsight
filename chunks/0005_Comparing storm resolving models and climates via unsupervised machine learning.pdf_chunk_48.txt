the change in the atmosphere’s structure with warming, which we refer to as a distribution shift. Specifically, let 
(π0K

) the correspond-
ing quantities in a climate globally warmed by four Kelvin. Then, the probability shifts πk = (π+4K

K ∈{1, 2, 3} reveal the effects of climate change on convection patterns.
