exploratory sampling of speciﬁc regions in the remote Pa-
ciﬁc with a full chemical payload measuring most of the key
species (Hoell et al., 1996, 1999; Raper et al., 2001; Davis
et al., 2003). The MOZAIC-IAGOS program uses in-service
aircraft and has provided a unique multi-year, objective cli-

major ﬂight routes at cruise altitudes (8–12 km) and at pro-
ﬁles above airports (Marenco et al., 1998; Thouret et al.,
