is not dominating, we indeed see that the shape-preserving
schemes produce range-preserving unmixing.
Quantiﬁcation of mixing
The quantiﬁcation of mixing, ℓi, i = “r”, “u”, “o”, is de-
picted in Fig. 15 using a histogram. The purpose of this
ﬁgure is to show how ℓi varies among schemes at the res-
olutions 1.5◦and 0.75◦as well as to observe how shape-
preserving ﬁlters affect ℓi for each individual scheme. The
histogram is ordered according to “minimal” resolution 1λm
