Understanding convection via vertical structure
To analyze the dominant vertical structure of convection, we calculate the horizontal variance of vertical velocity 
within each image. For this, we compute the horizontal mean wi separately at each vertical level (Note this is 
done over a 2D field at each grid cell, not globally, so wi is not equal to 0), and then subtract it to create the
