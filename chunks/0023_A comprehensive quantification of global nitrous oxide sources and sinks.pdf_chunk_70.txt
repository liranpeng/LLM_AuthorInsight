in agriculture.
There are numerous mitigation options in the agriculture sector 
that are available for immediate deployment, including increasing 
the efficiency of nitrogen use both in animal production (through 
the tuning of feed rations to reduce nitrogen excretion) and in crop 
production (through precision delivery of nitrogen fertilizers, split 
applications and better timing to match nitrogen applications to crop 
demand, conservation tillage, prevention of waterlogging, and the
