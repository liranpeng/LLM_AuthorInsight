CSLAM3/4, CAM-FV1.2). The UCISOM scheme has a
strictly shape-preserving limiting option. However, to avoid
“excessive” diffusion, the limiter has been relaxed, which ex-
plains the undershoots with that scheme. If a scheme shows
ripples with a strictly shape-preserving ﬁlter, then it may be
due to inconsistent coupling between the air mass and tracer
mass ﬁelds when the mixing ratio is extracted. For example, a
scheme that is not “free-stream”-preserving will suffer from
this deﬁciency.
