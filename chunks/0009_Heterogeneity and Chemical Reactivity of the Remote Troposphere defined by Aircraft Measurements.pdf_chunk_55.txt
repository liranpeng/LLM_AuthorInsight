Unfortunately, while investigating sensitivities and uncer-
tainties in the RDS for a future study, we found an inconsis-
tency between the reported concentrations of both pernitric
acid (HNO4) and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) with respect
to the chemical kinetics used in the models. High concen-
trations (attributed to instrument noise) were reported under
conditions where the thermal decomposition frequency was
> 0.4 per hour in the lower troposphere (> 253 K for HNO4
