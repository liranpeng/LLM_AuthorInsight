Global temperature deﬁned by the linear ﬁt to tempera-
ture since 1970 now exceeds 1 ◦C7 relative to the 1880–
1920 mean (Fig. 2b), where the 1880–1920 mean pro-
vides our best estimate of “preindustrial” temperature (Ap-
5Extreme end points affect linear trends, but if the 2016 tem-
perature is excluded the calculated trend (0.176 ◦C decade−1) still
rounds to 0.18 ◦C decade−1.
