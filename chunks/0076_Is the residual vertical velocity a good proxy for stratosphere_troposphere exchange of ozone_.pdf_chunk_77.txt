rate ﬂux diagnostics methods. Thus, the two simulations, based on ECMWF IFS data, provide a good analog
for diﬀerent chemistry-climate models and climate change simulations. As similarly pointed out in Olsen
et al. [2013], one cannot simply quantify the multiyear downward transport by the BDC using the residual
advective velocity and scale it to represent the corresponding O3 STE.
We recommend that STE O3 ﬂuxes be directly calculated in numerical models using the tropospheric column
