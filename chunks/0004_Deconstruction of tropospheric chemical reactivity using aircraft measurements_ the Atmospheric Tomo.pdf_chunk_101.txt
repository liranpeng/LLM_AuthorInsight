ﬂights of ATom-1 (53◦S to 60◦N) with respect to the species
measured by ATom. Sensitivity analyses are often calcu-
lated with CCMs to assess the factors controlling the trends
and variability in CH4 lifetime (Holmes et al., 2013). With
CCMs, the calculation includes emissions, scavenging, trans-
port, and chemistry, but here using ATom observations we are
limited to a 24 h snapshot with only the chemical evolution of
the parcels. We believe that this limitation does not affect our
