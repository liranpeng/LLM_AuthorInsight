where K is the number of observations sites and weights wk
are deﬁned as follows. In standard inverse-distance weight-
ing wk = |x−xk|−β, with β typically in the range 1 ≤β ≤4.
We optimize β as described below after adjusting the weights
for distant and clustered observations. Weights are set to
zero when |x −xk| exceeds a threshold L to avoid mean-
