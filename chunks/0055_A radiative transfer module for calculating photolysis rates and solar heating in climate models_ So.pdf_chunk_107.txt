at 1.25 km and falls to zero by 2.3 km altitude. Because of
the increasing thickness of the model layers with altitude,
the LWP and layer τ are not as smoothly peaked. We deem
this proﬁle realistic from comparing to the observed range for
coastal marine low clouds (see Fig. 4 of Hu et al., 2007 for
July liquid cloud radii distribution and Fig. 1a of Painemal et
al., 2016 for LWP).
Table 5 summarizes the clear-sky radiative budget and the
stratus cloud radiative effect (CRE, W m−2, calculated as
