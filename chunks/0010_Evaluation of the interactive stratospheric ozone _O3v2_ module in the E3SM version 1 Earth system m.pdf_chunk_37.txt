model metrics that address the simulation of stratospheric
ozone. Thus, it is important to separate the ozone column
data (in DU, Dobson units, milli-cm-amagats) into strato-
sphere and troposphere (see Ziemke et al., 2019, for deriva-
tion and analysis of the tropospheric column). This is not
typically done, but it is important since tropospheric ozone
has its own driving forces for both trends and interannual
variability. In fact the trends in column ozone over the past
