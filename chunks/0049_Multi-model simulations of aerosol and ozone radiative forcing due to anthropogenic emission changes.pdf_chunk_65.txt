uncertainties are large, and the model diversity of aerosolâ€“
cloud interaction is especially pronounced. The model range
in the direct aerosol effect can be explained by the indi-
vidual aerosol components and the diversity in modelling
these processes. The model range in the forcing of the di-
rect aerosol effect of nitrate aerosols is large and needs fur-
ther investigation. The model range in the direct aerosol ef-
fect of BC is also large, but recent progress on BC lifetime
