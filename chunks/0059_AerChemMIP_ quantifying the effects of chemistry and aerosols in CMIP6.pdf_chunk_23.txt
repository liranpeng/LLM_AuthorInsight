gases and aerosols may affect the temperature response to a
given WMGHG concentration level. Better exploration and
documentation of the changes in atmospheric composition
in a changing climate is of interest for many other purposes
such as choosing among different air quality mitigation op-
tions or understanding perturbations to ecosystems and bio-
geochemical cycles. Finally, uniform evaluation of the mod-
els will expose systematic biases and better constrain our
