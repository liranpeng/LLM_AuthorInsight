air masses that were sampled two days earlier during the outbound flights.
Since the GV range is substantially reduced when flown at lower levels, the amount of time 
that could be flown for low-level boundary sampling was limited to about 50% of the flight 
time between California and Hawaii. Thus a strategy was developed that allowed for two 
types of samplingâ€”1) surveying and 2) in situ. In the surveying mode, the MBL structures,
