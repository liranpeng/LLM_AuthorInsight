station (Mauna Loa). Red curve is monthly global mean relative to the same month of prior year; black curve is 12-month running mean
of red curve. (b) CO2 growth rate is highly correlated with global temperature, with the CO2 change lagging global temperature change by
7â€“8 months.
jected this century with continued high fossil fuel emissions,
equivalent to doubling atmospheric CO2, would likely lead
to substantial ice sheet collapse and multi-meter sea level
