sink or emissions. The models diagnose their own soil sink (see
Methods), and this is used together with atmospheric loss, to
calculate the lifetime in the models. The corresponding emissions
can be estimated as the total sink and the total production must
balance. In d) the soil sink and estimated emissions are shown.
The soil sink values have a large range between 44–73 Tg yr−1,
while the estimated emissions range between 29–68 Tg yr−1. The
