evolution of clouds along the trajectories sampled.
The environments sampled during some of the CSET cases showed substantial variability in 
the aerosols and associated cloud characteristics. An example of this variability in the 
extreme is shown for the RF02 (7 July 2015) and RF03(9 July 2015) cases when fires in 
Canada produced smoke plumes that were advected into the CSET sampling area and 
impacted clouds in Fig. 10. The effective cloud radius estimates from the GOES satellite
