tion in the northern extratropical UTLS. Although air trafﬁc
has the strongest effect on upper tropospheric ozone mixing
ratios between 30–60◦N particularly road emissions have a
substantial impact on ozone in that region also on the global
scale.
The efﬁciency of ozone production per NOx molecule
emitted is highest for aircraft emissions being three times
higher than the emissions from ships, which in turn perturb
ozone more efﬁciently than NOx from road trafﬁc. The high
