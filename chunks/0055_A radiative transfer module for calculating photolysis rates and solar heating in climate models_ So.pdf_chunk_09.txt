J. Hsu et al.: A radiative transfer module
of aerosols and clouds (Boucher et al., 2013). In comparison,
relatively little attention has been paid to improving the treat-
ment of aerosol and cloud scattering in climate models. This
is both surprising and not. Solutions of the radiative trans-
fer (RT) equations in scattering media are well documented
with numerous methods and readily available packages such
as TUV (Tie et al., 2003; Palancar et al., 2011) and SCIA-
