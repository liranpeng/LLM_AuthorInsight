quantization (see “Methods” for details), in particular if the number of clusters is large. We find that VAEs are 
essential to our dimensionality reduction task. Directly attempting the clustering in the raw data space does not 
result in stable and reproducible clusters. Likewise, a simpler dimensionality reduction technique such as PCA 
also fails to create robust results (Fig. 8). Furthermore, we find that the VAE-based clusters are interpretable and
