form cloud layers is still quite different across models, and
fractional overlapping cloud ﬁelds are often ignored, (e.g.,
Prather, 2015). Likewise, we do not attempt to control the
proﬁles of O3 and aerosol above and below the air parcels
insofar as they impact photolysis. Hence we diagnose pho-
tolysis rates (J-values) in addition to reactivities.
An inherent uncertainty is the day-to-day variability of
clouds experienced by each parcel. Thus for the single data
