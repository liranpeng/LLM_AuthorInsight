Spatial heterogeneity of tropospheric chemistry
A critical unknown for tropospheric chemistry modeling is
what resolution is needed to correctly calculate the budgets
of key gases. A similar question was addressed in Yu et
al. (2016) for the isoprene oxidation pathways using a model
with variable resolution (500, 250, and 30 km) compared
to aircraft measurements; see also ship plume chemistry in
