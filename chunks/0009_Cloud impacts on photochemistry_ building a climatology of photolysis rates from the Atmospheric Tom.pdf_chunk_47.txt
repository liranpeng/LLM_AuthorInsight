and J-clear (TUV) for the tropical Paciﬁc, the J-NO2 vari-
ability is driven almost entirely by clouds as expected, while
the J-O1D variability is driven ﬁrstly by O3 column and sun
angle (both CAFS and TUV), while there are clearly cloud
contributions (CAFS only) at lower altitudes (> 700 hPa).
Figure 1 shows a full comparison of the CAFS J proﬁles
with the 10 model results in four panels (2 Js × 2 geographic
blocks). The CAFS Js ﬁt within the range of models; their
