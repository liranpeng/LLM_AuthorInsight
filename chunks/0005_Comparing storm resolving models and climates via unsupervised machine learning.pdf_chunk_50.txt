convection over warm ocean waters and particularly the Pacific Warm ­pool30, with shallow convection becoming 
less prevalent in these unstable areas. Finally, as shown in Fig. 6c, the rare “Green Cumulus” mode becomes more 
common over semi-arid land masses, consistent with the overall intensification and expansion of arid zones (dry 
get drier mechanism)31,32.
We find evidence of the vertical shift in the structure of each convective regime as temperatures warm,
