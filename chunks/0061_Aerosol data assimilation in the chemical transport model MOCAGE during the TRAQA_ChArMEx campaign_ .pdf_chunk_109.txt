factor that could contribute to the difference between the
modelled and the assimilated curve is a possible declining
effect with time of previous assimilation cycles on the as-
similated curve.
During ﬂight C (Fig. 8c), the aircraft ﬂew directly through
the desert dust plume. The concentrations are elevated over
a wide range of heights. The assimilation model run signif-
icantly improves the aerosol number concentration, by hav-
ing it close to the measured ones for most of the ﬂight path
