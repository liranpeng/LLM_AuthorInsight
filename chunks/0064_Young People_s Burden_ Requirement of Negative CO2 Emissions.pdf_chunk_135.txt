Scenarios with linearly growing CO2 extraction at rates re-
quired to yield 350 or 450 ppm airborne CO2 in 2100 are in
Fig. 11b and d. These forcings and the assumed climate re-
sponse function deﬁne expected global temperature for the
entire industrial era considered here (Fig. 12). We extended
the global temperature calculations from 2100 to 2200 by
continuing the % yr−1 change in CO2 emissions. In the cases
with CO2 extraction we kept the GHG climate forcing ﬁxed
