The impact of anthropogenic aerosol on clouds is more
uncertain. The ﬁrst aerosol indirect eﬀect, also known as the
cloud albedo eﬀect, was estimated by the IPCC AR4 to be
0.7 W m2 (range 0.3 to 1.8 W m2).10 Quaas et al.83 used
satellite data to estimate a smaller cloud albedo eﬀect of
0.2 W m2, potentially suggesting that models may be over-
estimating the eﬀect. However, a more recent multi-model
