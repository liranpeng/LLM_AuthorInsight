All tests above were based on traditional error norms com-
puted at time t = T when the ﬂow, in the absence of any nu-
merical errors, has advected the distributions back to their
initial position and shape. As discussed in Lauritzen and
Thuburn (2012), the ﬁrst half of the simulation, where rel-
atively well-resolved features collapse in scale (at t = T /2
the initial condition cosine bells have been deformed into
thin ﬁlaments), is typical for atmospheric ﬂow. The second
