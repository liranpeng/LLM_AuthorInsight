by deployment with reforestation and afforestation and with
crops used for BECCS; this could signiﬁcantly enhance the
combined carbon sequestration potential of these methods.
For cost estimates, we ﬁrst consider restoration of airborne
CO2 to 350 ppm in 2100 (Fig. 10b), which would keep global
warming below 1.5 ◦C and bring global temperature back
close to the Holocene maximum by the end of the century
(Fig. 12b). This scenario keeps the temperature excursion
