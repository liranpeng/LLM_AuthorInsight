intermodel differences. For three models, the road forcing
is highest, followed by shipping followed by aviation. For
p-TOMCAT this order of importance is reversed.
The forcings are within their stated uncertainties in broad
agreement with those reported by Fuglestvedt et al. (2008)
except for road trafﬁc, for which a value of 54±11 mWm−2
was reported. A main reason for the weaker radiative forc-
ing is the use of lower road emissions in this study com-
