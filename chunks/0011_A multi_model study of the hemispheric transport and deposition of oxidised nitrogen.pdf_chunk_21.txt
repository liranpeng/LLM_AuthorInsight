monthly varying sea surface temperature and sea ice fields
to drive their meteorology (Table S1). Each simulation was
1 year long, but all models were executed for a minimum of
6 months beforehand to bring the concentrations of reactive
species into balance with the particular meteorology, emis-
sions and chemical mechanisms used.
[9] The simulations consist of a control run, using the
best estimate emissions for 2001, and a series of experi-
ments where the anthropogenic emissions of NOx were
