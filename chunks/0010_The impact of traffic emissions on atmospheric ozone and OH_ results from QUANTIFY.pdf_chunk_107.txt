important in the boundary layer below 950 hPa, where the
mean perturbation relative to the background can be as high
as 16% (see also Fig. 8). As evident from Fig. 8 the contri-
bution of ship emissions is particularly important in the sub-
tropical monsoon regions and the tropics, where convection
leads to upward transport of the emissions and to a relative
contribution of 50% up to the tropical tropopause.
The relative contribution of road emissions peaks in the
