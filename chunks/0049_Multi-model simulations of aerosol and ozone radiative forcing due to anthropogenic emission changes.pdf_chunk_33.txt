1990; MacIntosh et al., 2016).
Six models simulated changes in annually averaged PM2.5
(particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than
2.5 µm) over the 1990–2015 period. A model mean linear
trend is ﬁtted and shown as a function of latitude and longi-
tude; see Fig. 2a. Regional changes in the model mean range
from 2 to 3 % yr−1 reductions over much of the USA and
Europe to 1 to 2 % yr−1 increases over much of southern
and eastern Asia. The inter-model variation is small, as the
