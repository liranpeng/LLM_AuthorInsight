LF-RPN model improves further compared to the SF-HF-
RPN model for the tropics between the 400 and 600 hPa
pressure levels, which is a smaller region compared to the
improvement observed for the heat tendency. The LF-RPN
model also shows higher R2 values for both polar regions. The
MF-RPN model improves further upon the LF-RPN in the
tropical region between the 200 and 900 hPa vertical levels,
and also in the temperate zone between 250 and 700 hPa
