strong dependence on inter-annual meteorological variability.
Over South and East Asia, the PM2.5 projections do not rank
according to the RCP RFs. Instead, RCP6.0 represents the
high end of the PM2.5 range and RCP4.5 represents the low
end. Over South Asia, the PM2.5 projections are strongly tied
to the OC emissions (Fig. 7). South Asian SO2 emissions
decline similarly under all of the RCPs, with the exception
of RCP6.0 in which SO2 emissions may contribute to raising
