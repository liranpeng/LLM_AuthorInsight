burning source from their other sources (Bock et al., 2017; Ferretti et al., 2005; Mischler et al., 2009; Sapart
et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2010). Uncertainties in the value of the isotopic source magnitudes through time ulti-
mately leads to challenges interpreting the CO and CH4 data and may explain some of the differences between
trends in different ice core proxy records (Sowers, 2010) (Figure 1).
