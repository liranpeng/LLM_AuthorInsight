modeled patterns mostly match their standard-QBO composites despite minor differences (i.e., reversal 
from negative to positive in the SH for GMI).
Thus, for more than a year, N2O showed a sustained growth of 0.25 ppb/yr above the long-term average 
(about 0.8 ppb/yr over the period analyzed here). This growth was not caused by a reduction in stratospheric 
influx of N2O-depleted air that we modeled. The simplest explanation is that starting in late 2009, there was
