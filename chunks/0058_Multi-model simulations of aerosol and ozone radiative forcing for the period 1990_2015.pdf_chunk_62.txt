tion Pathways 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario, which has a weaker in-
crease in the forcing than the RCP8.5 scenario. The stronger
ozone forcing in this work compared to IPCC AR5 is likely
to be mainly caused by an increase in NOx over the 1990â€“
2010 period that is more than twice that in the emission data
used in IPCC AR5; see Fig. 1. Changes in CO and VOCs
are relatively small in the ECLIPSE data and those used for
IPCC AR5. The smaller ozone trend from the EMEP model
