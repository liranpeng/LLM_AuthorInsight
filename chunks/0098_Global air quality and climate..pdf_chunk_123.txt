individual models.38,58,65,66 This uncertainty leads to discre-
pancies in the magnitude and, in the case of Europe under the
RCP8.5 scenario, the sign of the overall surface O3 change
(Fig. 4). Future increases in shipping emissions, which are
subjected to less stringent regulations than land-based emis-
sion sectors, may also contribute to raising baseline pollution
levels in some regions.293,294 Both rising baseline O3 levels and
a warming climate could contribute to lengthening the O3
