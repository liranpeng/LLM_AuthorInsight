much as tropospheric ozone (10.4 DU ppm(CH4)−1), but the
change is small compared to the total stratospheric column.
We ﬁnd that stratospheric water vapor produced by oxi-
dation of methane causes small decreases in stratospheric
ozone (−4.3 DU ppm(CH4)−1). Although these stratospheric
effects have greater uncertainty because they are assessed
