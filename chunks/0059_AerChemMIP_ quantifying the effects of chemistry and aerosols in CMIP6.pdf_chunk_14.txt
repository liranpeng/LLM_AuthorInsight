pound (VOC) emissions and methane abundance (mostly
affecting the troposphere) and decreases in ozone driven
by ozone depleting substances (ODSs), such as chloroﬂu-
orocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs)
(mostly affecting the stratosphere) (Shindell et al., 2013b).
The net ERF due to ozone is primarily the result of multi-
ple emission changes. For example, one of the largest com-
