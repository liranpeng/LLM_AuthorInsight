the North Atlantic ﬂight corridor. More recent studies cal-
culated an overall maximum effect of 5% for the year 2000
in the northern tropopause region (Grewe et al., 2002). De-
pending on season the values typically range between 3 ppbv
and 7.7 ppbv in January and September, respectively (Gauss
et al., 2006). The global annual averaged radiative forcing
due to the additional O3 from air trafﬁc is estimated to be of
the order of 20 mW/m2 (Sausen et al., 2005).
