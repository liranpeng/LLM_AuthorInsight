Table 3. Data potentially relevant for computational efﬁciency. Columns are scheme acronym, width of halo or computational stencil to
update tracer value, number of stages for multi-step time-stepping algorithms (right-hand side evaluations), CN time step restriction (“Lips-
chitz” is a ﬂow-dependent time step limitation), and what information can be reused for each additional tracer.
