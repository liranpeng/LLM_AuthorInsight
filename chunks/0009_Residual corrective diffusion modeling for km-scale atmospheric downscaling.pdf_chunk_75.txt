first predict the mean Î¼ using a regression model, which is then
stochastically corrected using an Elucidated Diffusion Model (EDM)
r, together producing the probabilistic high-resolution 2 km-scale
regional forecast. Bottom right: diffusion model is conditioned with
the coarse-resolution input to generate the residual r after a few
denoising steps. Bottom left: the score function for diffusion is
learned based on the UNet architecture.
