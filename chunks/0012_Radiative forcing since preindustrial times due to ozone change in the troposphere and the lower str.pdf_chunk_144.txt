M. Gauss et al.: Radiative forcing due to ozone changes between 1850 and 2000
Fig. 7. Adjusted radiative forcing (Wm−2) between 1850 and 2000 due to stratospheric ozone change (between the tropopause and 30 km
altitude), taking into account chemical change only (“2 minus 1c”). Results are shown only for models that calculate stratospheric chemistry
