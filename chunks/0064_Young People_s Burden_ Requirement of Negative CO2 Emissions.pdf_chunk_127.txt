However, this limitation to fast feedbacks may soon become
important; it is only in the past few decades that global tem-
perature rose above the prior Holocene range and only in the
past 2 years that it shot far above that range. This limitation
must be borne in mind when we consider the role of slow
feedbacks in establishing the dangerous level of warming.
We calculate global temperature change T at time t in
response to any climate forcing scenario using the Greenâ€™s
function (Hansen, 2008)
