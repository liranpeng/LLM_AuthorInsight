For ice-water clouds, we have two T-matrix computations
supplied by M. Mishchenko for Cloud-J (Mishchenko et al.,
2004) for warm (irregular) and cold (hexagonal) ice clouds.
These included Q and the scattering phase function (includ-
ing A0:7) for the visible region (∼600 nm) and were used
at all Solar-J wavelengths. When there is signiﬁcant absorp-
tion, the values of SSA, and to some extent Q, are complex
