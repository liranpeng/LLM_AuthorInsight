lation model (ECHAM5-OM) simulations. NCAR applied
data from Parallel Climate Model simulations described by
Washington et al. (2000), whereas LMDzINCA used SSTs
based on Rayner et al. (1996). STOCHEM HadGEM1 used
AMIP-II datasets for the present day climate, while for the
preindustrial simulation the model applied data from a long
term integration of the Hadley Centre HadCM3 coupled
atmosphere-ocean climate model. Also UM CAM applied
data from a Hadley Centre coupled ocean-atmosphere gen-
