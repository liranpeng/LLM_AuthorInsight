In contrast to the other GSRMs, which treat continental connection as a single regime, we have identified a third 
unique mode that we call “Green Cumulus,” which is exclusively found over specific sub-regions of semi-arid 
tropical land areas (see Fig. S11a).
Changing probabilities of convective modes in response to global warming
We again use technical notation to measure the shift in convection patterns between the control and warmed
