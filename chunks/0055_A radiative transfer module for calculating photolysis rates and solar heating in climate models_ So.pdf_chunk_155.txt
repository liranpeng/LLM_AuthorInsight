A proﬁling of the Solar-J code shows that the Fast-J
core, consisting of a scattering matrix generator and block-
tridiagonal solver, is the dominant cost. These two subrou-
tines are already well optimized in terms of single CPU
multi-threading; however, porting Fast-J to computers with
graphical processing units (GPUs) has shown promise for
greater speed. One effort targeted a single GPU and demon-
strated speedups via CUDA (Compute Uniﬁed Device Archi-
