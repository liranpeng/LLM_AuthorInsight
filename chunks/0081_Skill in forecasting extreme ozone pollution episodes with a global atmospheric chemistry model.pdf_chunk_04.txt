istry, and air pollution are noted in early climateâ€“chemistry
studies and have come to the forefront recently (e.g., Jacob
et al., 1993; Johnson et al., 1999; Prather et al., 2001; Jacob
and Winner, 2009; HTAP, 2010; Fiore et al., 2012; Kirtman
et al., 2013). Some studies indicate that climate change may
increase the intensity, duration, or frequency of ozone (O3)
pollution episodes (Mickley et al., 2004; Leibensberger et al.,
2008; Jacob and Winner, 2009). Future changes in air quality
