on the choice of the fourth-order hyperviscosity coefﬁcient
for low-resolution simulations with HOMME. For speciﬁc
choices used in HOMME, see Appendix A8.
HOMME has been incorporated as a dynamical core op-
tion in NCAR’s Community Atmosphere Model (CAM,
Evans et al., 2013). The conﬁguration using the HOMME
spectral element dynamical core in CAM is referred to as
CAM-SE (Dennis et al., 2012). The test case suite was also
run with CAM-SE (equivalent to HOMME-p3) but using the
