We do not report ( ¯Z)(X) for grid boxes where over half of
the interior points Z(xi) are zero.

Quality of prediction and the interpolation mask
The interpolation procedure should be limited to the region
being modeled and where a reliable prediction can be made.
We begin with a desired mask of 1◦× 1◦cells and then check
if the interpolation is adequate. For the US, we use the land-
mass of the contiguous states (CONUS) and include ocean
