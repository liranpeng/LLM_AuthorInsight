ciﬁc (3–8 km) is clear in Fig. 2 and likely due to easterly mid-
tropospheric ﬂow from convection over Mexico at that spe-
ciﬁc time (29 July 2016). Similarly, the ATom reactivity at a
low level (1–3 km) in the Atlantic is associated with biomass
burning in Africa and was measured in other trace species.
Thus, in terms of L-O3, the ATom–model differences may
be due to speciﬁc meteorological conditions, and this could
be tested with CTMs using 2016 meteorology and wildﬁres.
