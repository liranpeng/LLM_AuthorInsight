ated standard deviations (given in brackets after each value)
give an indication of the spread in model results. The largest
impacts of each region on another are EU on EA (2.4%),
NA on EU (2.1%), SA on EA (6.4%) and EA on NA
(1.3%). These proportions should be compared with the
amounts of NOy exported. For example, SA exports 20% of
the NOx emitted, of which 32% is deposited in EA. The
scatter in the model results is most likely to be due to
