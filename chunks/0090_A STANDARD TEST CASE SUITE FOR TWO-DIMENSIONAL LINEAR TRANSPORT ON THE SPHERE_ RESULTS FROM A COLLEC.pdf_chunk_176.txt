other words, the larger τm is, the better the scheme preserves
the “peaks” of the cosine bells.
The histogram in Fig. 6 is mainly shown to investigate vi-
sually if there is a relationship between “minimal resolution”
and τm. Had there been a simple linear relationship, the val-
ues of τm would decrease/increase from the left to right in the
histogram. As for the numerical convergence rates (Fig. 4),
there is no simple relationship indicating that ℓf measures
