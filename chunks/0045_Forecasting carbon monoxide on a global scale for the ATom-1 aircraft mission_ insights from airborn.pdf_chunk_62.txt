ring over Alaska and northwest Canada, features also seen
in the GEOS-5 simulation. Over the Atlantic section, CO
maxima with slightly lower values occur around the same
latitude over west Greenland as shown both in observations
and model simulation. CO over the northernmost locations
along the ATom-1 circuit see some low values both in model
and observations, particularly north of 30◦N and south of
40◦S, due to the measurements occurring in the stratosphere
