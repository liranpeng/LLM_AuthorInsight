set of global aerosol (mostly ofﬂine) models for AR4 and
AR5. The complex path from precursor emissions to aerosol
loads, to optical and cloud-perturbing properties, to ﬁnally
forcing has been simulated with well-documented diversity
(Schulz et al., 2006; Myhre et al., 2013b; Ghan et al., 2016).
More recently, aerosol forcing was quantiﬁed in ACCMIP,
with many models using the same setups as used in CMIP5.
These results were combined with additional simulations un-
