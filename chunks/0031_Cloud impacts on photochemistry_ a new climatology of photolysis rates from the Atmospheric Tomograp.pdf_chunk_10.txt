a new standard test of cloud effects. The observations quan-
tify how clouds alter photochemistry and are compared here
with parallel analyses from nine global atmospheric chem-
istry models.
Since the early models of atmospheric chemistry, the sci-
entiﬁc community has tried various approximations and ﬁxes
for “those pesky clouds”. Overhead clouds can shadow the
sun, resulting in diminished J values beneath and within the
lower parts of thick clouds. Cloud scattering results in en-
