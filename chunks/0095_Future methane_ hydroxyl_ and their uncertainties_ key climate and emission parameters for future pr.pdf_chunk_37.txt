et al., 2010). Søvde et al. (2012) provide a full description
of lightning emissions in UCI CTM and Oslo CTM3, and
Murray et al. (2012) do the same for GEOS-Chem. Light-
ning NOx emissions average 6 Tg(N) yr−1 in GEOS-Chem
and 5 Tg(N) yr−1 in UCI CTM and Oslo CTM3.

Recent (1997–2009) variability of CH4 lifetime
Figure 1 shows τCH4×OH for 1997–2009, as simulated by
the 3 CTMs. The tropospheric OH lifetimes range from 8.5
to 10.1 yr. The longest of these lifetimes (GEOS-Chem) is
