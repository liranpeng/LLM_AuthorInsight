branches oﬀat 40–50◦N in the lower stratosphere going poleward as well as equatorward. The poleward
branch eventually converges in the polar region before entering the troposphere, representing the classical
descent branch of the BDC into the Arctic, e.g., Liang et al. [2009]. The equatorward branch intersects the 250
ppb level at about 40◦N and then the 120 ppb and e90-tropopause in the subtropics before entering the tro-
