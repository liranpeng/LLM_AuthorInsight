teor. The lower panel documents kilometer-scale wind speed
variations on the order of 2 ms−1 that extend into the sur-
face layer (derived from the short-range wind lidar, deﬁned
with respect to 3-hourly running means). One question asked
is whether, for a given surface friction, convectively driven
ﬂows can sustain a relatively large near-surface wind, and
weaker surface layer wind shear, than expected from shear-
driven turbulence alone. The third panel shows that the ratio
