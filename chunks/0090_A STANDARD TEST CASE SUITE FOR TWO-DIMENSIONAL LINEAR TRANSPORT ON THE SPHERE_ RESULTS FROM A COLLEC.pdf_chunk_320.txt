here used L = 2.
While limiter L = 3 can eliminate ripples on both sides of
sharp gradients, it leads to a linear decline of the peak tracer
abundance, even when the tracer has a large constant plateau
that is resolved by many cells, as in the slotted cylinder. A
simple test of UCISOM is done with a constant plateau of
tracer value (110 tracer units in 12 Ã— 12 cells) embedded in
a background (10 units on a cylinder of circumference 32
cells) and moving diagonally round the cylinder. After sev-
