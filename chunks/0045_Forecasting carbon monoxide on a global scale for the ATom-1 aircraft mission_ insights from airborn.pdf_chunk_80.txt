a larger contribution from Northern Hemisphere source re-
gions. Asian non-BB explains over a third of the total CO
for the North Paciﬁc ﬂights (ﬂights 2–3), while Asian and N.
American non-BB sources make comparable contributions to
the North Atlantic and N. American ﬂights (ﬂights 9–11).
Since Figs. 5 and 6 reveal differences in source contribu-
tions between the lower troposphere and the middle and up-
per troposphere, we also examine the source contributions
