tion differs considerably between the models (see Table S2),
and is likely to be a principal source of uncertainty in the
source-receptor relationships; this process is more efficient
at removing NOy than dry deposition. Some models do not
include uptake of NOy by aerosols. Only one model
simulates the formation, transport and deposition of ammo-
nium nitrate. Some of the scatter in the sensitivities will be
due to the different sources of meteorology, despite the
