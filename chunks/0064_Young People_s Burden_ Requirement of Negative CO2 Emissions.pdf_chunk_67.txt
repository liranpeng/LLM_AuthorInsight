mospheric CH4 causes tropospheric ozone (O3) and strato-
spheric water vapor to increase (Myhre et al., 2013). Uncer-
tainties, discussed by Myhre et al. (2013), are typically 10–
15 % for GHG forcings. The aerosol forcing uncertainty, de-
scribed by a probability distribution function (Boucher et al.,
2013), is of order 50 %. Our estimate of aerosol plus surface
albedo forcing (−1.2 W m−2) differs from the −1.5 W m−2
