rameter β = 0.25. It uses the FCT shape-reserving limiter
described in Zalesak (1979); no additional explicit diffusion
is used in these tests. The Voronoi meshes described as 1.5◦,
0.75◦, and 0.67◦refer to the average cell-center spacing rel-
ative to an arc length at the Equator, and these meshes use
21 506, 86 018, and 107 522 cells, respectively, to tile the
sphere. The tests are performed using CN ∼0.8, which cor-
responds to 768, 1536, and 1800 time steps to complete the
