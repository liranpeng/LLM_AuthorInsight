The RICO and BACEX observations provided insight into entrainment and precipitation 
processes in small cumulus clouds (e.g., Nuijens et al., 2009; Minor et al., 2012; Zuidema et 
al., 2012a) and provide a background for the CSET observations in the fair weather cumulus 
regions sampled.
Although recent field programs have advanced our understanding of processes operating in 
the two cloud regimes central to CSET, they have not directly addressed the stratocumulus to
