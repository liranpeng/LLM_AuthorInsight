in Hawaii with a 1 day lead time, demonstrating the ability to
simultaneously forecast. Moreover, diffusion models have been used
directly for probabilistic weather forecasting and
nowcasting34,35,36,37 – including global ensemble predictions that
outperform conventional weather prediction on a range of
important stochastic metrics at 0.25-degree resolution8. See
Supplementary Section 1 for more details.
Building upon these works, we turn to our challenge of interest –
