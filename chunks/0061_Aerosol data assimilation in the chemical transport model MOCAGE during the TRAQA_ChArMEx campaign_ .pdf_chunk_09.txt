At the same time, the number and quality of aerosol obser-
vations has also increased through advances in sensing tech-
nology and techniques. The last decade of aerosol research
has brought on more accurate measurements of more speciÔ¨Åc

and over long periods of time (De Leeuw et al., 2011). In
essence, we are in a golden age of aerosol data, but still look-
