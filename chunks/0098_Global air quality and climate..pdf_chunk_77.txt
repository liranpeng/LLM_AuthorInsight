Climate impact assessments have largely neglected feedbacks
between air pollutants and biogeochemical cycles.74 O3 deposi-
tion on vegetation suppresses CO2 uptake by the land or
vegetation sink.175 One study suggests the magnitudes of the
O3 direct RF and the O3 indirect RF through CO2 are
comparable.33 Aerosols reduce the total amount of radiation
reaching the surface but can enhance the diï¬€use component,
which may penetrate deeper into a vegetation canopy depending
