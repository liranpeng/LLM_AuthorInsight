the satellite observations. Thus, for STE ﬂux as a function of
latitude and month, we compare across models (in this case
with the UCI CTM).
In O3v2 the net STE ozone ﬂux is calculated from the loss
in the near-surface (lowest 4) atmospheric layers. Ozone is
conserved in the rest of the troposphere and thus the STE ﬂux
is taken up by these lowest layers. It is resolved geographi-
cally and monthly but because of the tropospheric transport
from tropopause to lowest layers, the STE ozone ﬂux di-
