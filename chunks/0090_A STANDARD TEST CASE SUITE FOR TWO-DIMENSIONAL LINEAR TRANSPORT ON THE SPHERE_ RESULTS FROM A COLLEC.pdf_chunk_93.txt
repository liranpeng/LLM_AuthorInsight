of unresolvable deformation into parcel ﬁlaments, which one
may also describe as aliasing in Lagrangian space. The Eu-
lerian solution is simply a ﬁrst-order forecast; in this case, a
ﬁrst-order version of CSLAM is used. Hence HEL is cate-
gorized under ﬁnite-volume semi-Lagrangian schemes, and
the Lagrangian parcel part of the algorithm is viewed as a
shape-preserving limiter in the context of this intercompari-
son. Lagrangian parcel values are used to nudge the shape-
