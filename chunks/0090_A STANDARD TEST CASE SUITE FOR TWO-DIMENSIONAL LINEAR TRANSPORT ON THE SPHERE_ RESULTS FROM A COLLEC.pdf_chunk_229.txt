tion of SBC-CN5.2 (at 1λ = 1λm), all schemes see a re-
duction in ℓu when using a shape-preserving limiter. Shape-
preserving limiters usually degrade conventional error norms
compared to the unlimited scheme. On the contrary, the “un-
mixing” diagnostic, which accounts for spurious unmixing,
improves.
The effect of shape-preserving ﬁlters on “real” mixing
varies among the schemes. Some schemes see a reduction
in ℓr, and some see an increase in “real” mixing compared to
