the Southern Ocean and the Arctic basin but, as expected
from global chemistry models, these regions contribute lit-
tle to the global O3 and CH4 budgets.
ATom’s regular proﬁling of the ocean basins allows for
weighted averages to build probability densities for key
species and reactivities. Although the individual curtain plots
for each ocean transect show clear meteorological variabil-
