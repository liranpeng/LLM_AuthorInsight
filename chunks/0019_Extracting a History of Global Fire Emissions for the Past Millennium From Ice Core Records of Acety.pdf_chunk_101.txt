sensitivity to emissions from South America as compared to any other southern latitude site (Table 1).
To test the inﬂuence of spatial changes in the distribution of ﬁre, we moved all non‐boreal biomass burn-
ing ethane and acetylene emissions to South America (Figure 6), while keeping the same vegetation type
distribution in South America as modern day (i.e., no changes to the emission factors). This reduces the
