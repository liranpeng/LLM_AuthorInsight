properties
To compare Solar-J and RRTMG-SW, we adopt a standard
atmospheric column model, typical of the tropical oceans
(surface albedo is 0.06) and deÔ¨Åne three cases: clear sky, a
stratus liquid-water cloud, and a cirrus ice-water cloud. Both
cloudy cases assume 100 % cloud cover; the cloud overlap
algorithms of Cloud-J are not invoked. Aerosols are not in-
cluded either. Atmosphere and cloud properties are given in
Table 3. Each test case is evaluated at four different solar
