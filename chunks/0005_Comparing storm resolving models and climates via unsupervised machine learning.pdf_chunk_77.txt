Figure 1.   An overview of our machine learning based approach. We extract 2D vertical velocity fields from 
GSRM’s across the tropics. We use a variational autoencoder to reduce these high dimensional vertical velocity 
fields to low dimensional latent representations for analysis. Clustering of these latent representations reveals 
three unique regimes of tropical convection. We can compare the “Distance” between these GSRMs by looking
