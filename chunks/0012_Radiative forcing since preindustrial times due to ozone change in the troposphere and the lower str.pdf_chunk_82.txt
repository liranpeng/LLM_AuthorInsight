Models without stratospheric chemistry
had to simulate scenario 1b instead of 1c (LMDzINCA,
UM CAM, STOCHEM HadAM3). Although the CHASER
and STOCHEM HadGEM1 models do not have comprehen-
sive stratospheric chemistry schemes they could perform sce-
nario 1c, since their methods of calculating stratospheric
change take into account changes in chlorine and bromine.
During the integrations the CTMs used the same meteo-
rology repeatedly (year 2000) and applied a sufÔ¨Åcient inte-
