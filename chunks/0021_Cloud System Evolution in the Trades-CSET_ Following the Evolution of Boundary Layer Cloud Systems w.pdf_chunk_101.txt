correspond to the equivalent end points of the 48-52 hour trajectories. A blowup of the lidar 
and the radar sampling made on the BC segments for RF10 and RF11 are shown in Fig. 8. 
These segments clearly show a strong change in the cloud type and amount between the 
beginning and the end of the trajectories. After two days there is substantially less low cloud 
in the end of the trajectory sampling than in the beginning. There is also a notable deepening
