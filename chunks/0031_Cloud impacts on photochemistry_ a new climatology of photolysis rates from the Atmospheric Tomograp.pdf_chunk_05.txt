ing circumnavigations of the troposphere capturing each of
the seasons during 2016–2018. This work examines J values
from the Paciﬁc Ocean ﬂights of the ﬁrst deployment, but
publishes the complete Atom-1 data set (29 July to 23 August
2016). We compare the observed J values (every 3 s along
ﬂight track) with those calculated by nine global chemistry–
climate/transport models (globally gridded, hourly, for a
mid-August day). To compare these disparate data sets, we
