on a more uniform set of background conditions than those
occurring in the stratosphere, and this is to be expected. The
20 % O3 differences between O3v2 and O3v1 in the low-
ermost stratosphere have little impact on this metric, as ex-
pected. If all models used Linoz chemistry, this metric would
not be useful, but since many have their own independent
chemistry modules, we expect this to be a useful check.
