cycles in transport and surface emissions. The three models each use a different meteorology to drive the 
atmospheric circulation, but they all predict a clear QBO signal similar to that in the NOAA surface data. 
The larger annual cycle driven by seasonality of emissions and transport including stratospheric influence 
has previously been studied by Nevison et al. (2004). Section 4 looks at the modeled annual cycle in surface
