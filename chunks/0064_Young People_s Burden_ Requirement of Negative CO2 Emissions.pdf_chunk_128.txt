where R(t′) is the product of equilibrium global climate sen-
sitivity and the dimensionless climate response function (per-
cent of equilibrium response), dF(t′)/dt′ is the annual in-
crement of the net forcing, and Fv is the negative of the
average volcanic aerosol forcing during the few centuries
preceding 1850. Fv × R(t) is a small correction term that
