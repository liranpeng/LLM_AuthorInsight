sion of the convex hull shape towards the upper left corner of
the scatterplot. The FARSIGHT and CLAW schemes result
in a much different shape that differs from an “extension” of
the convex hull shape.
As alluded to above, it is immediately visible in the scat-
terplots if the “shape-preserving” versions of the schemes are
strictly shape-preserving. For example, CAM-FV has slight
overshooting mixing even though the dimensionally split
application of one-dimensional operators is strictly shape-
