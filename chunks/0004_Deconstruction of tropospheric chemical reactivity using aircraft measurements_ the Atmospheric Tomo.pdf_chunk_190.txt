Figure 67 shows this linearized O3 loss frequency (1/T T,
units of per day) for the Paciﬁc and Atlantic ﬂight proﬁles
of ATom-1. High values > 0.15 d−1 occur throughout the
northern tropics below 5 km. In the upper troposphere, the
timescale for O3 is slow, 20 d or longer. Basin-mean loss fre-
quency is similar in both the Paciﬁc (0.065 d−1) and Atlantic
