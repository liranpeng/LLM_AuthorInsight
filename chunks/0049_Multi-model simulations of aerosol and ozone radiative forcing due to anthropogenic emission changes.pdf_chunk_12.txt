scattering, while others enhance absorption of solar radia-
tion. They may also affect cloud formation, albedo and life-
time through a range of mechanisms (Boucher et al., 2013;
Kaufman et al., 2002). Since the net aerosol forcing is nega-
tive (cooling), a reduction in anthropogenic primary aerosol
emissions and emissions of aerosol precursors implies a pos-
itive forcing over the time period of emission reductions.
The aerosols have a variety of types and composition
