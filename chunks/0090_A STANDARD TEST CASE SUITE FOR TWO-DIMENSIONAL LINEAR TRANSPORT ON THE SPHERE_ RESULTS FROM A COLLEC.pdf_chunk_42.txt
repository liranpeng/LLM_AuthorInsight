and Baumgardner, 2000), which would require integrating a
polynomial of degree K2. Instead, the ﬂux is approximated
by
⟨φ(x,y) · ρ(x,y)⟩≈⟨φ(x,y)⟩· ⟨ρ(x,y)⟩,

which eliminates the non-linear interaction between non-
constant terms in the polynomials of φ and ρ. This simpliﬁ-
cation reduces the order of the polynomial: instead of having
