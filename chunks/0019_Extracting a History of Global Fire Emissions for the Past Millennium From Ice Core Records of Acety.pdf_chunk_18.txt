over the past millennium as indicating a complexity of the methane and methane isotope budgets.
Interpretation of the methane isotope signal in terms of pyrogenic emissions requires assumptions about
trends in microbial emissions and knowledge of the end‐member isotopic composition of multiple sources.
Acetylene has a simple biogeochemical cycle, with ﬁre as the major source during the preindustrial
