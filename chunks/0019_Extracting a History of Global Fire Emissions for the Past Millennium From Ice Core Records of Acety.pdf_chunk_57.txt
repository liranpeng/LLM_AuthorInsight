for the depletion in atmospheric Î´13CO2 since industrialization (Rubino et al., 2013; Table S1). The model
includes CH4 losses to OH, soil, and the stratosphere and simulations are done with and without a chlorine
sink. The lifetimes of CH4 with respect to OH, soil, stratosphere, and chlorine are 11.2, 200, 120, and
