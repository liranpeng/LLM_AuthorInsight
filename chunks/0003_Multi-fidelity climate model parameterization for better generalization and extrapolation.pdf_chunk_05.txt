Introduction
Due to limited computational resources and the many scales
required in climate or turbulent simulations, unresolved sub-
grid processes are approximated through parameterization
schemes, or closures in numerical models. Parameterizations
serve as approximate representations of small-scale processes
and are the most dominant source of uncertainty in models
predictions. To reduce these structural closures errors and
uncertainties, several recent pieces of work have proposed
