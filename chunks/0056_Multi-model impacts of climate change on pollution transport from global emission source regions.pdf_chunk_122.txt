eraged zonal wind Ô¨Åelds were archived. Another limitation is
that, while the use of a single tracer emitted from all global
CO-sources highlights transport associated with the global
continental emission source regions, it precludes an in-depth
analysis of regional changes in transport patterns under cli-
mate change.
Nevertheless, this multi-model study presents a clear and
robust picture of the effect of climate change on the trans-
