The reactivity data stream (RDS)
The concept of using an MDS to initialize 3D global chem-
istry models and calculate an RDS was developed in the pre-
ATom methodology papers (P2017; P2018). In this paper, we
use the original six models for their August chemical statis-
tics, and we use Ô¨Åve of them plus a box model to calculate the
reactivities; see Table 1. The RDS is really a protocol applied
