different method.
The mean total ozone perturbations in Fig. 3 exhibit strong
hemispheric differences of the trafÔ¨Åc emissions with almost
zero effect in the southern hemisphere, but maximum effects
of about 4 DU during northern hemisphere summer (3 DU
during winter). All models simulate a similar location of
the strongest ozone perturbation extending from the north-
ern subtropical Atlantic to central Europe.
The maximum ozone perturbation is strongest pronounced
during northern summer.
