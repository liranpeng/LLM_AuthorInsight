2012; Ringler et al., 2011), is a generalization of one-
dimensional Taylor series approximations to the ﬂux op-
erators (Wicker and Skamarock, 2002; Hundsdorfer et al.,
1995) for a Voronoi tessellation of the sphere. Speciﬁcally,
these operators are generalizations of third- and fourth-order
operators currently used in atmospheric models employ-
ing regular, orthogonal rectangular meshes as, for exam-
ple, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model,
