differnt emissions, one needs to minimize non-linearities in
the chemistry calculations. The total removal of one emis-
sion source could lead to responses of the chemical system
such that the sum of the effects of each individual transporta-
tion sector exceeds the effect of all trafÔ¨Åc emission sources
switched off simultaneously. Furthermore the unscaled re-
sponse of the chemical system is expected to be closer to the
effect of realistic emission changes rather than a total emis-
