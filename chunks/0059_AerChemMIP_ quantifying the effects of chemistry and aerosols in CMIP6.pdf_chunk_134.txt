CMIP6. A speciﬁc problem may be the expected diversity
in model complexity, as mentioned in Sect. 3. Models may
contain interactive aerosols, tropospheric chemistry, strato-
spheric chemistry and any combination of these. AerChem-
MIP requests all output unless unavailable from an individual
model conﬁguration with good reason.
The diagnostics requested for the AerChemMIP ex-
periments are assembled in an Excel sheet in the sup-
plementary material for this paper (also available at
