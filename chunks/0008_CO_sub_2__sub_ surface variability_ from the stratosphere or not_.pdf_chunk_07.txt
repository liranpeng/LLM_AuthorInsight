the inclusion of CO2-depleted stratospheric air in column
CO2 calculations (Nassar et al., 2011; Deng et al., 2015;
Frankenberg et al., 2016; Pandey et al., 2016). For exam-
ple, Le Quéré et al. (2018) are concerned with how emissions
will mix throughout the troposphere and the stratosphere, but
not how stratospheric air will come back down to the sur-
face. Only studies of the CO2 triple-oxygen isotope signature
(117O) are concerned with accurate STE ﬂuxes, recognizing
