where we have expanded the forcing of methane to include uncertainties in the
radiative efﬁciency rCH4 and feedback factor ff CH4.
We ﬁnd a total uncertainty of 2.8.
For the terms that do not measure expanded uncertainty, we use the model
mean value. For each of the sigma-terms, we use either the standard deviation of
the model spread for the model ensemble, or values from literature. Details on the
