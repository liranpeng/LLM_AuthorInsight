The benefits of the CorrDiff downscaling compared to interpolating
ERA5 can be more clearly quantified by examining the logarithm of
the PDF of the windspeed, Fig. 5e. In the ERA5 the wind speed PDF
has a sharp cutoff such that high wind speed values in excess of 27 
ms−1 are missing. CorrDiff partially restores the tail of the typhoon
wind speed PDF, and is capable of predicting wind speeds up to 40
