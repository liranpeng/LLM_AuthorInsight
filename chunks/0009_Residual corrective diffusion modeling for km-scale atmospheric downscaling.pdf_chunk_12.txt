including mode collapse, training instabilities, and difficulties in
capturing long tails of distributions27,28,29.
Alternatively, diffusion models offer training stability30,31 alongside
demonstrable skill in probabilistically generating km-scales.32 used
a diffusion model for predicting rain density in the UK from
vorticity as an input, thus demonstrating potential for channel
synthesis.33 used a diffusion model for downscaling solar irradiance
