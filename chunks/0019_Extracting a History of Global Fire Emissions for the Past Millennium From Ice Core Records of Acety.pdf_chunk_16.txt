emissions from charcoal records would require considering known biases such as the underrepresentation
of ﬁres in grassland/dry shrubland biomes where low woody biomass limits charcoal production
(Marlon et al., 2008). This biome accounts for over half of the modern‐day carbon emission from ﬁres
(van der Werf et al., 2017).
Ice core trace gas measurements of methane and δ13CH4, ethane, acetylene, and carbon monoxide also have
