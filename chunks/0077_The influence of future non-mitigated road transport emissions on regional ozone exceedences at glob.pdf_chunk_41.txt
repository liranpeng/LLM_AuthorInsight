anthropogenic NOx emissions follow a similar pattern to that shown
for East China, peak near-surface O3 values are highest for 2025. For
the tropical sub-regions increases in peak near-surface O3 levels
occur by 2025, which dampens the seasonal cycle signiﬁcantly for
West Africa by contributing up to w20 ppb during August. For India
