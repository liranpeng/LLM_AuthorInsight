uses fully two-dimensional polynomial-based reconstruction
functions of degree two for air density ρ(x,y) and tracer
mixing ratio φ(x,y). Shape preservation is obtained with
fully two-dimensional slope-limiting (Barth and Jespersen,
1989). Integration over overlap areas on the cubed-sphere is
performed via line integrals in gnomonic cubed-sphere co-
ordinates. In Lauritzen et al. (2010) line integrals along co-
ordinate lines were computed using exact line-integral for-
