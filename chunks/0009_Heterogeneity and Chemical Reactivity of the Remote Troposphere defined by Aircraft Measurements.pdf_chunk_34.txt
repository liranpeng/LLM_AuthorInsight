H. Guo et al.: Heterogeneity and chemical reactivity of the remote troposphere
Many studies have explored the ability of chemistry–
transport models (CTMs) to resolve ﬁner scales such as pol-
lution layers (Eastham and Jacob, 2017; Rastigejev et al.,
2010; Tie et al., 2010; Young et al., 2018; Zhuang et al.,
2018), but these have not had the chemical observations
(statistics) to evaluate model performance. In a great use of
