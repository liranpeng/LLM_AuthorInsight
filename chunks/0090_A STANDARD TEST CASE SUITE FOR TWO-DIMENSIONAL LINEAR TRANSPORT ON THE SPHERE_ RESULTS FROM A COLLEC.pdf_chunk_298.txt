Spherical grid generation
The schemes SLFV-SL and SLFV-ML are implemented on a
spherical icosahedral-hexagonal grid (Sadourny et al., 1968).
We start with a spherical icosahedron, consisting of 20 equi-
lateral spherical triangles. To achieve the desired resolution
the edges of these 20 spherical triangles are divided into
N equal parts. Connecting these new points with great cir-
