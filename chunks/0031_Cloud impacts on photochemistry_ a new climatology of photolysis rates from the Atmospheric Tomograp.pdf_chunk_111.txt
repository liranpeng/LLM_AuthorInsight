variations in surface albedo. Nevertheless, the ocean surface
albedo (OSA) is variable (Jin et al., 2011), but most of these
models, including TUV, assume a uniform low albedo in the
range of 0.05 to 0.10. For the modeled ratio J-cloudy to J-
clear, using a Ô¨Åxed albedo is not so important since both
J values use the same albedo. For the CAFS / TUV ratio,
however, it is essential to have the TUV model use the OSA
that best corresponds to the sea surface conditions under the
