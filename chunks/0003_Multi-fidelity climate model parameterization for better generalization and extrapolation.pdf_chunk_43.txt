ics. For most of the vertical levels beyond the two extreme
ones, MF-RPN is improving upon LF-RPN which in turn is
outperforming deterministic NN and SF-HF-RPN models. In
addition, for lowest and highest vertical levels, MF-RPN is im-
proving upon the deterministic NN and SF-HF-RPN models
which in turn are outperforming the LF-RPN model. Hence,
the MF-RPN has the ability to get the best of the both worlds
by aggregating both datasets of different fidelity levels as (1)
