through successive proﬁles, particularly in the northern trop-
ics. The Atlantic P-O3 shows high-altitude reactivity similar
to the eastern Paciﬁc. Likewise, the large values of L-O3 and
L-CH4 match the eastern Paciﬁc and not the central Paciﬁc.
Unlike either Paciﬁc transect, the Atlantic L-O3 and L-CH4
show some high reactivity below 1 km altitude. Overall, the
ATom-1 proﬁling clearly identiﬁes extended air masses of
high L-O3 and L-CH4 extending over 2–5 km in altitude and
