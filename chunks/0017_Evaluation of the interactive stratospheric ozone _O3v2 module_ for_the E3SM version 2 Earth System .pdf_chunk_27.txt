Model simulations
The model simulations analyzed in this study are summa-
rized in Table 1. The control simulation uses one of the
three Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP)
type simulations (see Golaz et al., 2019 for more details)
forced with prescribed SSTs and sea ice concentrations (the
