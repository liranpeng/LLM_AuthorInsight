Key Points:
•	 Known errors and uncertainties in 
solar heating codes are evaluated 
within a single framework providing 
climate-relevant diagnostics
•	 Spectral resolution of cloud 
absorption, ice cloud optics, and 
cloud overlap schemes have large 
potential errors
•	 Other significant error sources 
from numerical or physical
