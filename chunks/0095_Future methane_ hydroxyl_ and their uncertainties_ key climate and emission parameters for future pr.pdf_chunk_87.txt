We ﬁnd that 85% of methane oxidation by tropospheric
OH occurs between 40◦S and 40◦N and that this region also
controls the interannual variability of τCH4×OH in the CTMs.
The same latitudes also dominate the variability of global-
mean temperature, water vapor, lightning NOx and biomass
burning, so the parametric model performs nearly as well if
these input variables are averaged over 40◦S to 40◦N in-
stead of globally. Stratospheric ozone exerts the greatest in-
