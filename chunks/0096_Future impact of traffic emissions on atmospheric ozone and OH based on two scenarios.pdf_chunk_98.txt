Conclusions
The future impact of trafﬁc emissions on atmospheric ozone
and OH has been studied and quantiﬁed using six atmo-
spheric chemistry models. The purpose of this paper is
twofold. First, new results were presented for a scenario rep-
resenting a possible high development of emissions (SRES
A1B). Second, the radiative forcing results calculated for
A1B were put in a larger context by comparing with recent
literature presenting impacts of trafﬁc emissions in possible
