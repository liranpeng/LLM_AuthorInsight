triggered. Thorough documentation of natural emissions and
3-D ﬁelds of reactive gases and aerosols is needed.
To relate natural emission changes to forcing, speciﬁc ex-
periments are designed in AerChemMIP which resemble the
ERF experiments (see Table 7). In these feedback experi-
ments radiation ﬂux and cloud variables are requested as in
the ERF forcing experiments. Other variables such as those
characterising aerosol and cloud optical properties, and land–
