thus be responsible for the underestimate. The tagged tracer
for biomass burning shows a small increase at the time of
the underestimated plumes near hour 22 of the Anchorage–
Kona ﬂight (Fig. 1d, g), suggesting that those underesti-
mates are due to the insufﬁcient magnitude of the simulated
biomass burning plumes. An exception is in the tropical Pa-
ciﬁc (Kona–Pago Pago ﬂight), in which GEOS-5 predicted
some enhancements, driven by fossil fuels, not seen in the
