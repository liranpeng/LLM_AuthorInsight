air today, the planet must be out of energy balance with the
planet gaining energy (via reduced heat radiation to space),
and more global warming is “in the pipeline”.
A useful check on understanding of ongoing climate
change is provided by the consistency of the net cli-
mate forcing (Fig. 4), Earth’s energy imbalance, observed
global warming, and climate sensitivity. Observed warm-
ing since 1880–1920 is 1.05 ◦C9 based on the linear ﬁt
to the 132-month running mean (Fig. 2b), which lim-
