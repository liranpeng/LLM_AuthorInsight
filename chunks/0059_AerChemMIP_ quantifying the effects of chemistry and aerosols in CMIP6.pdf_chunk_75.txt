columns refer to the speciﬁcations for concentrations (CH4, N2O and CFC/HCFC) or emissions (aerosol and ozone precursors). “Hist”
means the concentrations or emissions should evolve as for the CMIP6 historical simulation; a year means the concentrations or emissions
should be ﬁxed to that year. Three ensemble members are requested for each experiment.
