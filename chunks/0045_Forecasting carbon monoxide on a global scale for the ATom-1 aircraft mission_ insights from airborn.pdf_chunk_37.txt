Analysis of CO along the meridional ﬂight tracks
We compare CO from GEOS-5 to the QCLS CO obser-
vations for speciﬁc ﬂights, using the 10 s merge ﬁles. The
GEOS-5 CO is taken from the 3-D ﬁeld at the time closest
to the midpoint of the ﬂight and interpolated in space to the
ﬂight track. The ATom ﬂight tracks are shown in Fig. S3. Al-
though we brieﬂy discuss the other ﬂights as well, we focus
