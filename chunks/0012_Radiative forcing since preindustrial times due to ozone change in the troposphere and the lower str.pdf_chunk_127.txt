creased STE. The models of the present study appear to be
more prone to the increase in STE, and, in the case of some
models, to increased NOx production from lightning. The
inclusion of climate change leads to a slightly smaller strato-
spheric ozone column reduction in the models, which may
add to the positive effect of STE.

Radiative transfer calculations
The ozone changes discussed in the previous section are
used as input for detailed radiative forcing calculations. Sec-
