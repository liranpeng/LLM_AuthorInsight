ever, these layers have a negligible impact on N2O loss be-
cause very little of the critical ultraviolet radiation reaches
below 100 hPa. Each latitude proﬁle is weighted by the area
of the Earth ±2◦latitude on either side except for latitudes 1
(90–82◦S) and 43 (82–90◦N). For each column we calculate
the proﬁle of N2O loss from photolysis (J-N2O) and reaction
with the electronically excited atomic oxygen O(1D) from
the three reactions.
N2O + hv →N2 + O
(R1)
N2O + O(1D) →N2 + O2
