the cloud as a direct solar beam rather than as scattered light.
In RRTMG-SW (except for the Fu96 ice-cloud approxima-
tion), the HG phase function (Henyey and Greenstein, 1941)
is further used to approximate the scattering of aerosols and
clouds because of its simple power series formulation. The
HG phase function does not represent realistic scattering be-
cause it does not have the backward-scattering peak of real
aerosols and clouds. As might be expected, errors in two-
