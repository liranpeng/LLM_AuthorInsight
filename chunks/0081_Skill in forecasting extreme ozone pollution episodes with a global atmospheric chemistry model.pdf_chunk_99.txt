events. With this deﬁnition a random model is expected to
correctly identify 2.7 % of events. This metric does not take
into account the geographic pattern or persistence of AQX,
for which we apply clustering algorithms (see Sect. 4.4).
Skill here is calculated over all months of both years (2005–
2006), although almost all AQX events occur from May to
September.
Figure 9 shows the geographic pattern of CTM skill for US
and EU domains. For the US it is 24.4 ± 12 % (standard devi-
