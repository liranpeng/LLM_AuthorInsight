interactive, can be adjusted to near zero by selecting the fixed OSA, but there remains a strong latitudinal 
error of 3 W m−2 in ocean heating associated with high sun, see Figure 7. The zonal rms errors are large, 
2–8 W m−2, because of the wide diurnal range of solar zenith angles over the day, but given the thermal 
inertia of the upper ocean layers, this probably averages out. Overall, these results are similar to those found 
in Séférian et al. (2018).
