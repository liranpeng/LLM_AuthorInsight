tiﬁed in Sect. 3.2 and 3.3 as important inﬂuences on inter-
annual variability, we include CH4 abundance and anthro-
pogenic NOx, CO and VOC emissions for the historical re-
construction. NOx emissions are divided into land, ship and
aviation sectors because their sensitivities differ signiﬁcantly.
In total, the expanded parametric model includes 11 vari-
ables. For the 11 sensitivity parameters, αi in Eq. (3), we
adopt values from the average and spread of sensitivities in
