from ECMWF meteorology are used for photolysis. Simpli-
ﬁed stratospheric O3 chemistry is simulated with Linoz (ver-
sion 2, Hsu and Prather, 2009) and used for photolysis calcu-
lations and stratosphere-troposphere exchange. Aerosol ef-
fects on chemistry are neglected, which biases τCH4×OH low
by up to 5 % in addition to the aerosol-induced photolysis
bias described above for Oslo CTM3 (Martin et al., 2003;
Macintyre and Evans, 2010).
