provisional given that our chosen validation sample of 205
independent calendar times imperfectly samples especially low
likelihood/high-impact extremes.
While encouraging, CorrDiff’s emulation of radar statistics is also
imperfect; generated radar variance is somewhat under-estimated
on length scales greater than 100 km and over-estimated for the 10–
50 km length scales (Fig. 1c), associated with an overall
overdispersive PDF (Fig. 1f).
