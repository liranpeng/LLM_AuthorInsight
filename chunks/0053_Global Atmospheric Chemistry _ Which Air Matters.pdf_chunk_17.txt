rounding atmosphere, e.g., Prather and Jaffe (1990), Thuburn
and Tan (1997), Esler (2003), and Pisso et al.2009). Charac-
terizing chemical species in the atmosphere as having mean
abundances, or even mean vertical proﬁles, with a standard
deviation to represent the observed variability, does not re-
ally describe how these models generate heterogeneity and
how the different species co-vary. Assuredly, the atmosphere
has more processes and structures than are in our current,
