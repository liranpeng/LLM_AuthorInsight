Fast-J/. Cloud-J 7.3c as described here is included as a zip ﬁle
and includes new coding to correct failures in compilation or
execution (v7.3b) as well as reducing the cloud correlation
factor when there are decorrelation-length gaps between any
of the MAX-COR groups (v7.3c). Although with v7.3c some
J values changed in the third decimal place, changes in the
GMDD ﬁgures and tables were undiscernible. Subscribe to
