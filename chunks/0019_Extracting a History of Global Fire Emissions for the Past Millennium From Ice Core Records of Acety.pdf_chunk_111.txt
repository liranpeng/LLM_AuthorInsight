over long time periods, and during periods of large climate shifts. We are unable to fully address all the com-
plexities of the methane budget in this study, but acknowledge that some of the differences in the ﬁre his-
tories between acetylene, ethane, and methane may be due to the methane isotopic‐end‐member values
used in our model.
5. Conclusions
The focus of this study is on developing a quantitative record of changes in biomass burning over the past
