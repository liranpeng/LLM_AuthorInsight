lifetimes of chemically controlled greenhouse
gases from climate simulations. To this end, we
have successfully implemented Fast-J (radiation
algorithm determining key chemical photolysis
rates) and Linoz v3.0 (linearized photochemistry
for interactive O3, N2O, NOy and CH4) packages in
LLNL-CESM and for the first time demonstrated how
change in O2 photolysis rate within its
uncertainty range can significantly impact on the
stratospheric climate and ozone abundances. From
