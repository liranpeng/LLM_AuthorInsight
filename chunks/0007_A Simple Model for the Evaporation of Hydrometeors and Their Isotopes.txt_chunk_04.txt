of raindrops, of exchange with the environment, evaporation, and kinetic molecular diffusion. A parameterization of size‐dependent molecular and eddy diffusion is formulated that enriches raindrops much more strongly (+5‰ for deuterated water [HDO] and +3.5‰ for H218 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}^{18}$ O) than equilibrium evaporation as they become smaller than 1 mm. The effect on evaporated vapor is also assessed. Rain evaporation enriches subcloud vapor by +12‰ per mm rain (for HDO), explaining
