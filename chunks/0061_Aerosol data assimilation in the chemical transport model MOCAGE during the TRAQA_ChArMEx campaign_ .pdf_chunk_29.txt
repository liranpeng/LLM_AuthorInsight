aerosol emissions for BC and OC. We use daily BB emis-
sions for better synoptic forecasts, which is not possible with
the monthly mean emissions of Lamarque et al. (2010).
Sea salt particles are emitted using the semi-empirical
source function from Jaeglé et al. (2011), which includes
a particle size, wind speed, and sea surface water tempera-
ture dependence. Desert dust aerosols are emitted by a dy-
