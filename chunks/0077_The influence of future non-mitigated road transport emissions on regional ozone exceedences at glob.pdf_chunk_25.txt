For most of the world regions shown the additional NOx from RTE
A1B_HIGH falls to w0.1 Tg N yr1 by 2050 when compared to A1B,
thus being negligible in terms of total global N emissions.
3. Methodology
3.1. Multi-model ensemble
The multi-model ensemble used here is similar to that used to
assess the present-day and future impact of TE on tropospheric
composition and oxidative capacity (Hoor et al., 2009; Hodnebrog
et al., 2011, 2012). For the purpose of this study the ensemble in-
