data points concatenated over space and time. For longitude-
latitude structure, the error metrics are evaluated on points
concatenated across time. For pressure-latitude structure, the
error metrics are evaluated on points concatenated over time
and longitude. Models errors are evaluated on daily averages
as performed in Mooers et al.30 in order to have a compre-
hensive assessment of the models performance. For the MAE
metric, heat and moisture tendencies are scaled by the specific
