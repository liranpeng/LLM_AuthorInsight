erage J value for the chemistry module, again reducing the
occurrence of clear-sky J values. Thus, the result above (i.e.,
that Ô¨Åve models have about 50 % nearly clear-sky J values
down to the surface) is inexplicable unless they have col-
umn optical depths of 0.3 or very small effective cloud frac-
tions. At some model resolution, probably of order tens of
kilometers, the CAFS measurements may be a statistical rep-
resentation over that grid, and our comparisons, even with
