and NO2 + O. We tested other key J values like those of
HNO3 and NO2, but found that their errors fell between the
ﬁrst two.
The J value tests are summarized in Table 1. We use
a high-resolution snapshot from the European Center for
Medium-range Weather Forecasts, similar to what is used (at
lower resolution) in the UC Irvine and University of Oslo
chemistry-transport models (Søvde et al., 2012; Hsu and
Prather, 2014). The 640 FCAs are a 3 h average of a single
