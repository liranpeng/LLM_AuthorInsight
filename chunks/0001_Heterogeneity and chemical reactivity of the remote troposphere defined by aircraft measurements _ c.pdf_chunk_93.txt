give similar results when presented with the ATom-1 MDS.
The broad agreement of the cumulative reactive PDs across a
range of model formulations using differing levels of chem-
ical complexity shows this approach is robust. The different
protocols for calculating reactivities as well as the uncer-
tainty in cloud Ô¨Åelds appear to have a small impact on the
shape of the cumulative PDs but are informative regarding
the minimum structural uncertainty in estimating the 24 h re-
