schemes that participated in this intercomparison and the ac-
companying scheme acronyms are given in Table 1.
In this study grid spacings are quantiﬁed in terms of aver-
age resolution at the Equator irrespective of the discretization
grid. Schemes are compared using this deﬁnition of horizon-
tal resolution. If the reader is interested in schemes for mesh-
reﬁnement applications, for example, only a subset of the
schemes and grids presented here will have that capability.
