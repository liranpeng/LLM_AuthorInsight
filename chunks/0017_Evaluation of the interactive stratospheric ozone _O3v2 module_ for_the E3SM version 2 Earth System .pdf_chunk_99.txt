tropopause lifting at the tropics (see Sect. 4.1). These consis-
tent changes likely hint that the same mechanism (Brewer–
Dobson circulation) is responsible for the E3SM sensitivity
change.
In summary, the E3SM climate representation is slightly
altered (some slight improvements but more small degrada-
tions) with the new O3v2 scheme compared to the default
O3v1 scheme. Nevertheless, the changes do not affect the ﬁ-
