The subtropical NE Pacific stratocumulus to cumulus transition sampled during CSET 
flights has long been a canonical modeling challenge. Two benchmark cases of Sc-Cu 
transition have been used for international modeling inter-comparison efforts as part of the 
Global Atmospheric System Study (GASS) and its predecessor, GCSS. The first of these 
was from the 1992 NE Atlantic ASTEX project described previously (Bretherton et al. 1995,
