stratosphere, however, is a balance between production, ver-
tical transport, and photochemical loss above 40 km, and we
cannot estimate it from the production alone.
In parallel with our MLS N2O data analysis, S. E. Stra-
han led a full chemistry-transport modeling study of the MLS
period using the MERRA-2 wind Ô¨Åelds and focusing on the
chemistry of N2O, NOy, and O3. Their results support our
analysis and show that more rapid vertical ascent in the tropi-
