in each model layer. The “% clear” is the sum of fractions (%) with
log10(total COD) < −0.5; and the “< log(OD)>” is the average of
log10(total COD) > −0.5. The cloud ﬁelds come from the ECMWF
IFS cycle 38 system run at T159L60N160 resolution. On average
the number of ICAs per cell in the tropical block is about 170, al-
though individual cells may have > 1000. In spite of the high, 40–
60 % fraction of clear columns, the quadrature-averaged J values
usually include some cloudy fraction.
