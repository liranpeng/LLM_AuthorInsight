the hydrogen ﬂux in the perturbed simulations (the emissions
needed to sustain the concentration perturbation and hence include
chemical feedbacks) and the contribution to ERF via methane
changes added (see Method and Supplementary Table 3).
Increased hydrogen in the atmosphere leads to higher methane
levels. This gives an ERF from methane (green bars) of
0.46 mW m−2 (0.39–0.51 mW m−2 model range) per ﬂux
hydrogen (Tg yr−1). The methane increase changes both ozone
