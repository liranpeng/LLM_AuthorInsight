of acetylene and ethane levels over Greenland and Antarctica to various sources (Nicewonger et al., 2018,
2020). Sensitivities were estimated by deﬁning a reference model simulation of the modern atmosphere
and adding acetylene‐like and ethane‐like tracer species (Nicewonger et al., 2018, 2020). These tracers react
with the same OH lifetime and stratospheric loss rate as acetylene and ethane but do not affect the abun-
