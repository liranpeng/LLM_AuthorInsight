Paciﬁc, which is understandable since that longitude includes
Papua New Guinea and eastern tropical Australia. Most im-
portantly, the differences for 165–210◦E are less than those
across the six models (Fig. 7a). We need to develop an objec-
tive measure for comparing 2-D plots between models and
ATom measurements and for judging if their differences are
within the range of representativeness. Fortunately, the ﬁt-
