ling tracer transport, emissions, and scavenging. Differences
in reactivity across models are driven only by the chemical
mechanism and the diurnal cycle of photolysis rates, which
are driven in turn by temperature, water vapor, solar zenith
angle, clouds, and possibly aerosols and overhead ozone,
which are calculated in each model. We evaluate six global
