gases, acetylene, ethane, and methane, in order to determine if a single global “ﬁre history” (dry matter
burned) can be reconstructed over the last 1,000 years. All three ice core records indicate a large decline in
their respective biomass burning emissions after 1500 CE. However, a single ﬁre history of dry matter
burned over the last 1,000 years is not easily reconstructed from the ice core records even when enacting
