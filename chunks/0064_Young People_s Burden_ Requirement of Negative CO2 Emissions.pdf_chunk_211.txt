ate targets for GHG amount and global temperature, and we
thus infer an urgent need for (1) rapid phasedown of fossil
fuel emissions, (2) actions that draw down atmospheric CO2,
and (3) actions that, at minimum, eliminate net growth of
non-CO2 climate forcings. These tasks are formidable and,
with the exception of the Montreal Protocol agreement on
hydroï¬‚uorocarbons (HFCs) that will halt the growth of their
climate forcing (Appendix A13), they are not being pursued
