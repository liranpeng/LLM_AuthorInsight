terms of 24 h average rates and hence the units of ppb per day.
Reactivity deﬁned here requires sunlight; nighttime sources
of OH from alkenes and isoprene via ozonolysis or nitrate
radicals (Paulson and Orlando, 1996) are important primar-
ily in continental air over emission sources. This calculation
integrates over the diurnal cycle of photolysis rates driven by
changing solar zenith angle, clouds, O3, and aerosol proﬁles,
all of which are simulated in CTM–CCMs.
