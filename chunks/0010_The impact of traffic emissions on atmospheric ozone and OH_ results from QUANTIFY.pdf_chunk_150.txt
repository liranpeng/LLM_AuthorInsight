42 mWm−2 DU−1 from IPCC (2001). Together these lead
to a methane-induced ozone radiative forcing which is 0.42
times the methane radiative forcing. This method assumes
that the methane change is in equilibrium with the change in
OH, which will require several decades of constant emissions
to achieve.
The mean “net” forcing from the three components (Ta-
ble 8) is positive for road and aviation and negative for ship-
ping, as also found by Fuglestvedt et al. (2008). However,
