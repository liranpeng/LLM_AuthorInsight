computation, and the methods for approximating the average
of J values over all ICAs (Sect. 3) use at most four Fast-J
calculations no matter how many ICAs.
Two other cloud-overlap models tested here are the MAX-
RAN groupings G0 and G3 (Feng et al., 2004; Neu et
al., 2007). Model G0 assumes that all vertically adjacent
cloudy layers are a MAX group (maximally overlapped), and
all such groups separated by a clear layer are RAN over-
lapped. This model seems logical but has difﬁculty ﬁnding
