CWC are given, the corresponding wavelength-dependent
properties are derived from tables or formulae. In Solar-
J, the scattering phase function is truncated at eight terms,
but in RRTMG-SW’s two-stream model only the ﬁrst term
(A1/3 = g) is retained. For liquid water, RRTMG-SW adopts
the parameterization scheme by Hu and Stamnes (1993). For
ice clouds, three different parameterizations are available,
and all are tested here (Ebert and Curry, 1992, henceforth
