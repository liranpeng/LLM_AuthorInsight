G2023) calculated the reactivities for all 10 s air parcels from
the ﬁrst deployment ATom-1 (29 July–23 August 2016) and
compared their statistics with six global chemistry models’
sample days in mid-August. Note that the ﬁrst published ver-
sion (Guo et al., 2021) was withdrawn due to some errors in
the reactivities and is corrected with G2023.
Here we report reactivities for all four seasonal deploy-
ments (ATom-1234; see Fig. 1) and examine how their sta-
