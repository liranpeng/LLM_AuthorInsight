play an important role in modulating the CO-tracer changes
at these higher altitudes. In particular, all of the models fea-
ture a poleward shift in their zonal-mean zonal winds un-

et al., 2005; Orbe et al., 2015), leading to reductions in zonal-
mean winds in adjacent regions of the mid-latitude tropo-
sphere in both seasons, although they are generally largest
in winter (Fig. 10). However, although the broad patterns of
