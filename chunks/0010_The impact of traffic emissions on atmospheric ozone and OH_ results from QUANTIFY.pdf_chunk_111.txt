per extratropical troposphere is about 15% larger than that
of ships. Directly at the tropopause and in the lower strato-
sphere the contribution of aircraft dominates in the northern
hemisphere, whereas in the southern hemisphere upper tro-
posphere its effect on ozone is the smallest of the three types
of trafÔ¨Åc.
Note also that the relative contributions as given in Fig. 8
are based on the small emission perturbation and therefore
the relative fractions of each sector are different from the
