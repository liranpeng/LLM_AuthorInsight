ligible compared to the natural water cycle11, but in the strato-
sphere, this reaction can affect the water vapor levels. Finally,
changes in OH, ozone, and other oxidants may also affect the
formation of particles, especially sulfate, secondary organic
aerosols, and nitrate, and alter their size distributions12
Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) allow comparisons of the
global warming impacts of different gases, and hence hydrogen
