ms−1 compared with the maximum value of 50ms−1 in the target.
The diffusion component of CorrDiff is responsible for the most
extreme wind speeds in its predictions. In contrast, the mean
axisymmetric structure of the typhoon (Fig. 5f), is controlled more
by the UNet, which reveals the influence of CorrDiff on typhoon
geometry: With downscaling the radius of maximum winds
decreases from 75 km in ERA5 to about 50 km in CorrDiff,
compared with 25 km in the WRF model. At the same time, the
