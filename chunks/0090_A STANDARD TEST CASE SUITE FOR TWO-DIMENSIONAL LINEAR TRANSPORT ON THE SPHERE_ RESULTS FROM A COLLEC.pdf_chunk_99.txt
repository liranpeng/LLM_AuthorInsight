ing value to remain within a predeﬁned interval. Hence the
scheme is not necessarily locally shape-preserving. The par-
allel implementation uses dynamic communication to al-
low arbitrarily ﬁne domain decomposition regardless of time
step. However, it does incur the expense of a global synchro-
nization at each time step, and the mass ﬁxer uses global re-
ductions. For this class of schemes, free-stream preservation
is trivial since a constant φ will remain constant through-
