high-resolution models or observations38. A useful downscaling
model should simultaneously correct their size and intensity in
addition to generating appropriate fine-scale structure.
An example illustrating the benefits and limitations of CorrDiff for
downscaling typhoon Haikui (2023) is shown in Fig. 5. Compared
to the ground truth (Fig. 5d), the ERA5 reanalysis (Fig. 5a) poorly
resolves the typhoon, depicting it as overly wide and with no closed
