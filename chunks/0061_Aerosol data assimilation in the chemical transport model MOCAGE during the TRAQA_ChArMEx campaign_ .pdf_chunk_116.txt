The third LOAC ﬂight (Fig. 9c) measured moderate
aerosol concentrations coinciding with an air pollution
episode. The assimilation model run matches well with the
measured concentrations. The direct model run underesti-
mates the concentrations only in lower levels. However,
when compared with the assimilation model run, the assim-
ilation changes the aerosol vertical proﬁle signiﬁcantly: the
concentrations are increased much more in the lower levels,
