based weather prediction architectures [23] and adaptations of Fourier Neural Operators for arbitrary
geometric discretizations have been proven in low dimensional settings that could be readily extended
to SFNO [14].
Vertical coarse-graining
After the horizontal regridding is done for all variables, anticipating the
requirements for precise mass and energy conservation, we vertically integrate the 3D variables (air
