AIR and SHIP have low CO/NOx ratios and are efﬁcient in
perturbing OH.
The impact of AIR on OH concentrations in northern sum-
mer 2050 A1B peaks south of the North Atlantic ﬂight corri-
dor (where the humidity is larger and solar zenith angle lower
than further north) with a value of 3 × 105 molecules cm−3
(Fig. 4), which is almost twice the value predicted for the
same year under the B1 scenario (H2011). In year 2000,
SHIP was the transport sector which had the largest impact
