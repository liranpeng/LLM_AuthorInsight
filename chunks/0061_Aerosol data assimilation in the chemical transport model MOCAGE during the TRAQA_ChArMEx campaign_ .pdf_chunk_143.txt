in assimilation. In addition, it is difﬁcult to deﬁne the model
error covariance matrix in it. Another possibility would be
to apply techniques of bias correction (e.g. Dee and Uppala,
2008).
The impact of the AOD assimilation on the model found
in our study is coherent with ﬁndings of other studies (Zhang
et al., 2008; Schutgens et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011). Our ap-
proach is the most similar to the approach used by Benedetti
et al. (2009). We choose the same control variable, and the
