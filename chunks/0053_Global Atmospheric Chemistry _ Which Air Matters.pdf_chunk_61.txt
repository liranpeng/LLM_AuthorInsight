a C-run), we calculate the reactivity at a given grid cell, but
not that of a parcel. Air parcels move, change location, and
mix with neighboring parcels: i.e., there is no way to track
quantitatively what might be considered the original parcel.
Effectively, we keep integrating the rates in that grid cell as
different parcels travel through it and are mixed within it. Let
us take a large enough domain of grid cells (e.g., tropical Pa-
ciﬁc, 150–210◦E, from surface to 200 hPa) and calculate the
