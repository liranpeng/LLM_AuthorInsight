and summer are fairly similar (not shown).
Examining the spatial changes in tropical CO-tracer con-
centrations in the lower to mid-troposphere in relation to
the future increases and decreases described above, a clear
dipole pattern emerges across all four CCMs (Figs. 4 and
5). In particular, during winter, there is a large increase cen-
tred over equatorial and Central Africa (the regions with peak
biomass burning) and a decrease south of this of similar
