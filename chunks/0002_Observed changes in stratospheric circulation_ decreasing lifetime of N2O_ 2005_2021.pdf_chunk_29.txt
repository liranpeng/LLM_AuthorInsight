tive drift of the V5 MLS data in the lower stratosphere af-
ter 2010 as shown in Fig. 16 of Livesey et al. (2021). It
is unlikely to be real because suppression of vertical trans-
port of N2O below 30 hPa can hardly lead to increases in

itive trends at these pressures following the analysis of
Froidevaux et al. (2022). The trend increases rapidly, reach-
ing +5.5 Â± 1.2 %/decade in the central zone (10 hPa) and
