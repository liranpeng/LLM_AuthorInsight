The initial grid in TTS-I is based on polygons generated by
using a spherical centroidal Voronoi tessellation (Du et al.,
1999; Ringler et al., 2008; Ju et al., 2011), where the density
function that controls the distribution of polygons is set to
unity. The polygons are then traced throughout the integra-
tion. Due to the large deformation of the background ï¬‚ow,
the edges of the polygons will inevitably cross. To avoid this
ill-conditioned problem, a novel curvature-guard algorithm
