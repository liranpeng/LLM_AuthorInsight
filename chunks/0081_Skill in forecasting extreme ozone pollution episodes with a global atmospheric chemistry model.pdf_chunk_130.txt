nus cumulative distribution function) of the percentage of the
total areal extent of all events as a function of episode size
is shown in Fig. 11. For years 2005–2006 and gridded US
observations, about 74 % of all events occurred in episodes
greater than 100 × 104 km2-days and about 31 % in episodes
greater than 1000 × 104 km2-days; for the CTM, the corre-
sponding fractions are 66% greater than 100 × 104 km2-days
and 37 % greater than 1000 × 104 km2-days (Fig. 11a). For
