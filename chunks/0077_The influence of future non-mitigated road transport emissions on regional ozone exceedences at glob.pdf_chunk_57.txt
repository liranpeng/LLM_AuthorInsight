For the USA there is an area of exceedence from the East to the
West Coast, with some southern states exhibiting ER values of be-
tween 1.1 and 1.2 (i.e.) near-surface O3 mixing ratios reach 72 ppb.
Again, the strong photochemical activity which occurs at the more
southern latitudes under high NOx conditions enhances the in-situ
production of tropospheric O3. For 2025, mitigation of NTS emis-
sions reduces the ER values by up to 0.1, although looking at the
