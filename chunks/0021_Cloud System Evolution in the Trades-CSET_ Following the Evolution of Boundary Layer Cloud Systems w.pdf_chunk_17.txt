the north-Pacific trade-winds using the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V (GV, formerly known as 
HIAPER (High Performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research)) 
on flights between California and Hawaii. The long range of the NSF GV allowed for the 
sampling of air masses on low-level trajectories extending from California to Hawaii and
