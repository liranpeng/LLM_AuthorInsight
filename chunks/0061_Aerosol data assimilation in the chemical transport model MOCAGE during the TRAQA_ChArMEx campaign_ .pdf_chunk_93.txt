In situ aircraft concentration measurements
To further assess the performance of the assimilation model
run we evaluate the impact of the AOD assimilation on
aerosol properties other than AOD. To do this, we compare
the modelled aerosol number concentrations with the aerosol
concentrations measured in situ during the TRAQA period
by the PCASP instrument. During the campaign, ﬂights with
