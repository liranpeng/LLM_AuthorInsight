numeral convergence rates matching the formal order of ac-
curacy for higher order schemes (see, for example, Harris
et al., 2010). The meridional component of the velocity ﬁeld
v is not inﬁnitely smooth at the poles. However, since all
ﬁelds are constant at the poles (and in the vicinity of the
poles) and since all metrics are based on mixing ratio φ and
not tracer mass, this lack of smoothness in the derivative of v
has not been found to inﬂuence the results. Hence this setup
