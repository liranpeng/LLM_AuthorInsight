because mass-weighted averaging emphasizes below-cloud
OH concentrations and we ﬁnd compensating increases in
methane loss above clouds. In addition, past analyses of con-
vective ﬂuxes have found both positive and negative inﬂu-
ences on τCH4×OH depending on the convection scheme and
perturbation used (Lawrence and Salzmann, 2008).
Methane abundance and anthropogenic NOx, CO, and
VOC emissions vary smoothly between years, but changed
by 1–2 % over the 2000–2010 (Dlugokencky et al., 2011;
