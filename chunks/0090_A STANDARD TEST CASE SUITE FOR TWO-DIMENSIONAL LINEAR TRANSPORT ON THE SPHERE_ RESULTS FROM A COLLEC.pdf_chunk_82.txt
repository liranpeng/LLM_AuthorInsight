mulas (Ullrich et al., 2009). However, it was later found that
these may become ill-conditioned at high resolution: switch-
ing to Gaussian quadrature makes the algorithm robust but at
the cost of mass conservation unless mass consistency is en-
forced locally using the consistency enforcement algorithm
by Erath et al. (2013), which does not affect the locality and
efﬁciency of the CSLAM algorithm. The coupling between
ρφ and φ is by using the following reconstruction function
