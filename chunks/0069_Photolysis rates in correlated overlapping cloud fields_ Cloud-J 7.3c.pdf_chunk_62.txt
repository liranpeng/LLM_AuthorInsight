cal species, cross sections including quantum yields are pa-
rameterized as a function of wavelength (ν) and tempera-
ture (T ) (e.g., Atkinson et al., 2008; Sander et al., 2011).
In this case, Fast-J calculates solar-ﬂux-weighted, average
cross sections for each wavelength bin (Wild et al., 2000;
Bian and Prather, 2002). These tables are created for a set of
ﬁxed T ’s, and then the cross section used for each bin in each
atmospheric layer is interpolated in T . Many VOCs have
