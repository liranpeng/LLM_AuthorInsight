aerosol types, between size bins or with gases. The aerosol
dry deposition scheme is described in Nho-Kim et al. (2004).
The sedimentation is implemented as described in Seinfeld
and Pandis (1998). For the wet deposition, the model uses
Giorgi and Chameides (1986) for the implementation of the

The emission inventories for BC and OC are prepared as
follows. The anthropogenic component comes from Lamar-
