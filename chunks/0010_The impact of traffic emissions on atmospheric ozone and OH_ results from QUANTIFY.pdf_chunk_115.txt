than at the surface. Therefore each NOx molecule can be re-
cycled more often to produce ozone before being removed
via precipitation scavenging and dry deposition of HNO3.
Note that despite some individual differences, all models
indicate the largest efﬁciency to perturb ozone for NOx emis-
sions from aircraft and the weakest efﬁciency for road traf-
ﬁc. Ship emissions occur largely in remote areas with much
lower background pollution compared to road emissions. In
