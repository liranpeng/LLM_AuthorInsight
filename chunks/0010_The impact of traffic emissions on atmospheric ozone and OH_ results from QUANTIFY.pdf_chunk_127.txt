hand these low NOx concentrations accompanied with high
OH make the system more sensitive for NOx perturbations
than in polluted areas (Lelieveld et al., 2002). Furthermore,
road emissions occur at higher altitudes and latitudes where
average water vapor concentrations and solar irradiation are
lower and in regions where other anthropogenic sources of
pollution cause enhanced NOx levels. The combination of
these factors leads to a lower sensitivity of OH to perturba-
