depth (COD) based on method of implementing fractional clouds:
Cloud-J independent column atmospheres (ICAs, blue dots); sim-
ple cloud averaging over each cell (COD × CF, green dots) and
B-averaging (COD × CF3/2, orange dots). The 600 nm COD for
two large regions (tropical Paciﬁc, 20◦S–20◦N × 160–240◦E, and
North Paciﬁc, 20–50◦N × 170–225◦E. is collected for 16 Au-
gust 2016 from eight 3 h averages of COD and cloud fraction (CF)
