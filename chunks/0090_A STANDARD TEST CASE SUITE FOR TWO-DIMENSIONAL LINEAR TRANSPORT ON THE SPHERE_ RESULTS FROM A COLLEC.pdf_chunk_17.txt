linear relation between two tracers. The amount of mixing,
essentially introduced by truncation errors, was quantiﬁed
using novel mixing diagnostics.
In an attempt to standardize scheme testing under idealized
ﬂow settings as well as to reduce the number of tests while
still assessing a wide range of aspects of accuracy considered
important for geophysical applications, LSPT2012 proposed
a “minimal” test case suite with speciﬁc guidelines on reso-
