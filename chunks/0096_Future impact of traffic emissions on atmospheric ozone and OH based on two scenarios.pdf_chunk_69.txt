and SHIP in year 2000 (Table 1), the efﬁciency in perturb-
ing methane lifetime is relatively large also for this sector
(Table 3).
In the future, changes in methane lifetime changes largely
reﬂect the evolution of emissions for the various transport
sectors. AIR will have the largest increase, from 1.3 to 4.1 %
between 2000 and 2050 A1B, and SHIP remains the sector
with the largest impact on methane lifetime, with a 5.3 % per-
turbation in 2050 (Table 3). It is likely that regional changes
