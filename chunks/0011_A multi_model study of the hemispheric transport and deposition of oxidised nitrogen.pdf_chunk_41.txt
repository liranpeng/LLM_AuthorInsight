the other three. These results, particularly the latter, suggest
that the impact of intercontinental transport on regional NOy
deposition is small. A continental scale focus on NOx
emission controls might be the most effective policy to
reduce nitrogen deposition fluxes.
[18] The differences between the deposition fluxes from
the models will originate from many areas, including
differing resolutions and the complexity of their chemical
mechanisms. The fraction of NOy removed by wet deposi-
