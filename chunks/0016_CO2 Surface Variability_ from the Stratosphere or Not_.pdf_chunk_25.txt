2014; Wenzel et al., 2016). Here, I calculate the cycle simply
by averaging each calendar month of the year, with results
shown in Fig. 1b. The annual amplitudes (max–min) are 16.4,
6.4, 0.92, 1.02, and 1.14 ppm for BRW, MLO, SMO, CGO,
and SPO, respectively. These are consistent with those previ-
ous studies, although SH cycles remain understudied and not
well evaluated. In some months SMO at 14◦S can be north
of the South Paciﬁc Convergence Zone and thus inﬂuenced
