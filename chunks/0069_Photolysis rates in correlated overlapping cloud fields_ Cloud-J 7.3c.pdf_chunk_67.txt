For most VOCs the pressure dependence changes across the
wavelengths within a model bin, and thus the T dependence
averaged cross sections has different values at different P ,
but cannot be simply post-interpolated as a function of P be-
cause of the wavelength dependence of B. A 2-D set of cross
sections for each wavelength bin, interpolated as a function
of T and P , could be developed but would add to the com-
plexity and cost of Fast-J.
Recognizing that VOCs are predominantly tropospheric
