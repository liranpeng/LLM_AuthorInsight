than those projected under the older SRES (A1, A2, B1, B2)
scenarios.17,66 Alternative, lower pollutant emission scenarios to
the SRES scenarios (CLE, MFR)29 tend to cover the RCP range.
The RCPs assume aggressive control of NOx and other O3
precursor emission controls globally,23 falling below the current
legislation (CLE29) 2030 projections and reaching levels by 2050
that are equivalent to maximum feasible reductions (MFR29).
Even within this narrow RCP range for global emissions, larger
