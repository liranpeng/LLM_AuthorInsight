tem, visibility, etc.) between 2015 and 2055 (as the time
frame over which aerosol and precursor emissions are ex-
pected to be signiÔ¨Åcant; Shindell et al., 2012a; Fiore et al.,
2015). Such impact analysis can be performed by contrasting
two simulations: (a) a reference with weak air quality poli-
cies and relatively high aerosol and ozone precursor emis-
sions; and (b) a perturbation experiment where strong air
