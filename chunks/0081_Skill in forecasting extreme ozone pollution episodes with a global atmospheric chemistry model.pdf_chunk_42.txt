2 cells. The trapezoidal integration weights account for lat-
itudinal variation of the points. Thus the weight w∗
i of each
point xi for i = 1 : 25 in the grid cell X is
w∗
i = Ti cosθi,
(3)
where θi is the latitude and Ti is the trapezoidal integration
weight, which takes values of 0.25 for corner points, 0.5 for
edge points, and 1.0 for the interior points. The calculation of
the average ozone value at the grid cell X, (( ¯Z)(X)), is then
the weighted sum of ozone at points xi, Zi:
¯Z (X) =
