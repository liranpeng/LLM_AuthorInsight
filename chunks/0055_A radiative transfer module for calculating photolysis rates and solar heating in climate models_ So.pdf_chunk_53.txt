These parameterization schemes in RRTMG-SW aim to ﬁt
the ice-cloud optical properties – extinction coefﬁcient, SSA,
and g – as a polynomial function of re and CWC. Note that
Fu’s parameterization is based on the generalized effective
diameter (Dge) but can be related to the input re through
Eq. (3.12) of Fu (1996). Ebert and Curry’s parameteriza-
tion has been applied in the Community Atmosphere Model
