the response in the CO tracer is characterised by high in-
ternal variability, this dipole pattern is statistically signiﬁ-
cant across most of its extent in all of the CCMs. However,
there are small differences across models. Similar patterns of
change are simulated by the UM-CAM and STOC-HadAM3
CCMs (Figs. 4e–f and 5e–f) since they use the same driving
GCM. A stronger and more extensive area of increase and
a weaker area of decrease is simulated by the CMAM model
