some steepening of the gradients is taking place.
If a scheme is not shape-preserving, scatter points may
shift outside the convex hull either into the range-preserving
unmixing or overshooting area. Probably the most detrimen-
tal type of unmixing is overshooting unmixing or equiva-
lently range-expanding unmixing, which in this experimental
