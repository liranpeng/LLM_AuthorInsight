all‐SAV ﬁre characteristics were applied to all four of the scenarios in Table 2. The results show only a
slight reduction in the discrepancies between the inferred dry matter burned from acetylene, ethane,
and methane (Figure 5). Clearly, changing the emission factors to result in the highest ratio of emission
to dry matter burned alone cannot resolve these discrepancies between the inferred dry matter histories
from the three gases.
