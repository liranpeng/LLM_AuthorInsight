neous reactivities can be inferred from measurements of re-
active chemical species and the radiation ﬁeld combined with
laboratory cross sections and reaction rate coefﬁcients, e.g.,
Olson et al. (2012). Attempts to follow the chemical evolu-
tion of air parcels with aircraft measurements is limited and
quasi-Lagrangian at best (Nault et al., 2016). Even the con-
cept of isolated Lagrangian parcels is limited, since parcels
shear and mix rapidly as they go from a large, chemically
