(DeConto and Pollard, 2016). Ice sheet response time de-
creases rapidly in models as the forcing increases, because
processes such as hydrofracturing and collapse of marine-
terminating ice cliffs spur ice sheet disintegration (Pollard et
al., 2015). All amplifying feedbacks, including atmospheric
water vapor, sea ice cover, soil carbon release and ice sheet
melt could be reduced by rapid emissions phasedown. This
would reduce the risk of climate change running out of hu-
