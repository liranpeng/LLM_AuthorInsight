occur during El Ni˜no years (1982–1983, 1987–1988, and
1997–1998) driven mainly by water vapor and reinforced
by a smaller effect from temperature. τCH4×OH is also de-
pressed through much of the 1990s when stratospheric ozone
was low, due to the solar cycle and Mt. Pinatubo, enhanc-
ing UV penetration and photolysis in the troposphere. The
largest spikes in τCH4×OH occur when the solar cycle max-
imum and La Ni˜na are synchronous, as in 1989 and 1999–
