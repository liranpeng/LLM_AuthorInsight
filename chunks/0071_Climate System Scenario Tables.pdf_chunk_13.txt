changes in natural carbon dioxide (CO2) sources and sinks for 2010–
2100 based on this assessment (Chapters 6 and 12). Present-day natu­
ral and anthropogenic emissions of CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) are 
assessed and used to scale the RCP anthropogenic emissions to be con­
sistent with these best estimates (Chapters 6 and 11). Current model
