Figure 5. Same as Fig. 4 but for JJA. Note the different scales for (i) UM-CAM and STOC-HadAM3 and (ii) CMAM and GISS-E2-R for
the difference plots.
The largest changes occur in boreal winter, with decreases
of ∼2–6 ppb (∼5–10 %) in CO-tracer mixing ratios near
the surface at the Equator, and especially in the middle
