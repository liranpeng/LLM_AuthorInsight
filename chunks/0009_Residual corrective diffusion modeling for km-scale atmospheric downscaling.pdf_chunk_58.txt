dynamical and statistical downscaling is limited (see Supplementary
SectionÂ 7.3 for details). This paper focused on generation quality,
and not on optimal inference speed, for which gains could be easily
anticipated. Our CorrDiff prototype is using a dozen iterations
thanks to the initial regression step. Refinement of the technique
could reduce the number of iterations to only a few by using
distillation methods27,42,43 and pursuing other performance
optimization techniques44,45.
