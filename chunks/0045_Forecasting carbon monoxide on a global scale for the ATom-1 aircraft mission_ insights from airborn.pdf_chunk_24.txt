Model description
We use chemical forecasts and analyses from the GEOS-5
forward processing (FP) system to quantify the contribution
of different emission sources to the observed CO distribution
and to identify the origin of observed plumes. A global model
is necessary for this analysis since CO is transported globally.
The FP stream from the Global Modeling and Assimilation
OfÔ¨Åce (GMAO) generates GEOS-5 forecast products as well
