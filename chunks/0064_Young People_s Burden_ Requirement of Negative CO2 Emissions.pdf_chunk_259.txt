sumption data for 2013–2015 are used for the fractional an-
nual changes of each nation to allow extension of the Boden
analysis through 2015. Emissions were almost ﬂat from 2014
to 2015, due to economic slowdown and increased use of
low-carbon energies, but, even if a peak in global emissions
is near, substantial decline of emissions is dependent on ac-
celeration in the transformation of energy production and use
(Jackson et al., 2016).
