rate phase functions and no delta scaling (similar to the study
of Wild et al., 2000). One other source of error in RRTMG’s
model is the choice of delta-scaling factor, which they base
on the HG phase function using only g. Alternatively, one
can use the second moment of the true Mie phase function
(Wiscombe, 1977). We revised the RRTMG-SW code to do
this using Solar-J’s scattering phase functions and found a
modest reduction in this error from −14 to −9 W m−2 for
reﬂected sunlight (SZA = 0◦).
