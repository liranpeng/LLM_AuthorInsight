belongs in the category of intensive negative emission tech-
nologies, discussed below, whose environmental impacts and
costs require scrutiny. We conclude that 100 PgC is an appro-
priate ambitious estimate for potential carbon extraction via
a concerted global-scale effort to improve agricultural and
forestry practices with carbon drawdown as a prime objec-
tive.
Intensive negative emission technologies that could yield
greater CO2 extraction include (1) burning of biofuels, most
