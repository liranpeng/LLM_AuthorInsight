with satellite observations and with the UCI CTM running
the same O3v2 chemistry. O3v2 also enables ready diagnos-
tics of stratosphere–troposphere exchange ﬂux of ozone. Fur-
thermore, we examine how the O3v2–O3v1 changes in both
mean climate and climate sensitivity of E3SMv1.
Section 2 describes the model, the simulations, and the ob-
servations. The E3SMv1 model performance of stratospheric
