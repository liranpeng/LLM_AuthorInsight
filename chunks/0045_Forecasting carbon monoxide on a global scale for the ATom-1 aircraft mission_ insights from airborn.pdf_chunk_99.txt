pared to CO, as well as the large contribution from biomass
burning, likely explains the greater prominence of the tropi-
cal Atlantic in the aerosol case. Furthermore, AOT (Fig. 12)
shows a clear peak in 2009 in several of the regions, whereas
MOPITT data are missing for August 2009, but MLS shows
a minimum (tropical Atlantic) or no anomaly (other regions).
In summary, the multi-year satellite record shows consid-
erable variability in CO, particularly over the North Atlantic
