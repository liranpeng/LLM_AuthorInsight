10 yr (2000–2009) mean MDA8 (ppb) for (a) US (EPA AQS) and
(b) EU (combined EMEP and AirBase). The mask for interpolating
the 1◦× 1◦grid cells is also shown, with light gray indicating cells
with QP < 0.67 used here (see text).
2.1
Choosing a method for interpolating grid-cell
averages
We develop an interpolation scheme that provides grid-cell-
average values of surface O3 over the US and EU domains,
essential to compare observations to a gridded model. Our
