for historical following a similar philosophy to the “Easy
Aerosol” project.
For the prescribed SST experiments to diagnose transient
ERFs, RFMIP uses the pre-industrial conditions as the ref-
erence and perturbs one group of species at a time to evolve
following historical (e.g. in piClim-histaerO3); consequently
RFMIP speciﬁes a pre-industrial SST and sea ice climatol-
ogy. AerChemMIP uses the evolving conditions (historical)
as the reference with one group of species perturbed back to
