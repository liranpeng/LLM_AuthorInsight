clearly outperforms all other models with an average R2 equal
to 0.73 across different vertical levels (figure 2.b). In addition,
for all levels where the deterministic NN, SF-HF-RPN and LF-
RPN all fail (e.g. all levels below 160hPa, 897 and 937hPa),
the MF-RPN is still capable of providing significantly better
results than all these models showing even positive R2 values
(e.g. 0.36 and 0.32 for levels 897 and 937hPa) thanks to both
datasets aggregation.
