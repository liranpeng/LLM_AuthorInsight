and 2b. See Fig. 61. The numbers in the legend are, successively, the mean value of NOx and the mean value of log10(NOx), both in parts
per trillion. The four successive rows are 0–6 km for MDS V3 and V2b and 0–12 km for MDS V3 and V2b.
The values of sOH for the ATom-1 parcels are plotted for the
Paciﬁc and Atlantic ﬂight proﬁles in Fig. 70a and b, and the
mean values are −0.24 and −0.20, respectively. The value
of sOH is the most negative, about −0.3 in the lower tro-
