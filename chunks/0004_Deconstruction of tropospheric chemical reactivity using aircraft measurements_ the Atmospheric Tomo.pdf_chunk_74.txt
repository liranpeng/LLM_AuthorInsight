Clearly, the chemical mixture of these two regions is differ-
ent. The extreme statistics for the Southern Ocean are similar
to the Arctic.
The Antarctic ﬂights of ATom were a target of opportu-
nity for ATom-3 and ATom-4. ATom-4 (May) was too dark
to have signiﬁcant reactivity (extremely low J values, Ta-
ble 1). ATom-3 Antarctica has distinctly lower reactivities
than ATom-3 Southern Ocean except for P-O3, which is sur-
prisingly comparable.
