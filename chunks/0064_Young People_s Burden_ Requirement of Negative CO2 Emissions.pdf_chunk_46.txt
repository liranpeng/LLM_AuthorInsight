data. The formal 95 % conﬁdence bounds to Holocene tem-
perature (Marcott et al., 2013) are ±0.25 ◦C (blue shading
in Fig. 3b), but total uncertainty is larger. Speciﬁcally, Liu
et al. (2014) points out a bias effect caused by seasonality in
the proxy temperature reconstruction. Correction for this bias
will tend to push early Holocene temperatures lower, increas-
ing the gap between today’s temperature and early Holocene
temperature (Marcott and Shakun, 2015).
