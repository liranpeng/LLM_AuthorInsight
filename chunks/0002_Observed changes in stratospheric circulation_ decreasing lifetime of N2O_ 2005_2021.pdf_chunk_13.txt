with negligible impact on N2O loss. The N2O vertical grid
between 146 and 1 hPa (six evenly spaced log(pressure) lev-
els per decade) is coarser than that of O3 and T (both use 12
intervals per decade). The missing N2O levels in the O3â€“T
grid are calculated as the square root of the product of the
values on the adjacent levels. For pressures <0.4 hPa, where
MLS V5 N2O data are not reported, we set the abundance to
0 ppb. Our consolidated MLS dataset then covers 43 latitudes
