Zonal mean ozone perturbation
The zonal mean ozone perturbation for the integrated traf-
ﬁc emissions (Fig. 4) shows the largest effect in the north-
ern subtropics/lower-middle latitudes. In the northern hemi-
sphere boundary layer the mean ozone perturbation peaks at
5.5 ppbv in mid latitudes at 40–50◦N during summer de-
creasing to less than 3 ppbv during winter. The perturba-
tion mixing ratio peaks in the upper troposphere/lower strato-
