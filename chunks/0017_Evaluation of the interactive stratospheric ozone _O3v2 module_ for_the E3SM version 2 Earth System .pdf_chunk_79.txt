we will examine the ozone changes between O3v1 and O3v2
in greater details.
4.1
Changes in UT–LS
Figure 7 shows the pressure-by-latitude O3v1 ozone, as well
as O3v2-O3v1 differences in the annual mean and June and
October in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UT–
LS) region (50–400 hPa). The tropopause pressure (green
lines) from the O3v1 simulation is overlaid on the con-
tours to facilitate comparisons. Figure 7a–c illustrate the typ-
