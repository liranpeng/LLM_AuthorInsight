sources). The A runs are relatively easy to code for most
CTM/CCMs and allow each model’s chemistry module, in-
cluding photolysis package, to run normally. The A runs do
not distinguish between CTMs and CCMs, except that each
model will generate/prescribe its own cloud ﬁelds and pho-
tolysis rates. Our goal is to create a robust understanding of
the chemical statistics including the reactivities with which to
test and evaluate the free-running CCMs, and thus we do not
