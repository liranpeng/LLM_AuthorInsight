estimated16.
Perturbing
hydrogen emissions in a coupled model (GFDL-AM4.1) an
indirect radiative forcing of 0.84 mWm−2 per Tg yr−1 hydrogen
emitted was estimated; mostly due to longer methane lifetime and
increased stratospheric water vapor production17. This indirect
forcing translated into a GWP100 of 12.8 ± 5.2 (90% conﬁdence
interval)13. A new analysis with the 2D model TROPOS, which
reconciled the values of 2D and 3D models found a GWP100 of
8 ± 2 with 95% conﬁdence18.
