position, the model differences are due mostly to variabil-
ity in photolysis rates driven by clouds (Hall et al., 2018).
For example, the model–model root-mean-square differences
in reactivities adopting the same chemical composition are
∼10 % using the same model but different years (and hence
different cloud ﬁelds): they are ∼20 % for different models
that come close to matching one another, they reach 50 %
if those models use different H2O and T , and they exceed
