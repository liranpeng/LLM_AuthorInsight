in East Asia (0.3 (0.1–0.5) Tg N yr−1). Other direct anthropogenic sources 
together contribute N2O emissions of approximately 0.2–0.4 Tg N yr−1 
in each of East Asia, Africa, North America and Europe.
Both bottom-up and top-down estimates of ocean N2O emissions 
for northern, tropical and southern ocean regions (90° N–30° N, 30° 
N–30° S and 30° S–90° S, respectively) reveal that the tropical oceans 
contribute over 50% to the global oceanic N2O source. In particular,
