istry (Jaegl√© et al., 2011; Murray et al., 2012; Wang et al.,
2011), indicating minimal sensitivity of ship NOx impacts
to these processes. The ship RF is quite sensitive to an-
thropogenic emissions, however. Using the Climate Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) inventory for year 2000
(Lamarque et al., 2010) rather than the standard inventory
described in Sect. 2, the ship NOx RF components are about
15 % larger (Fig. 5). The shift in RF components lies along
