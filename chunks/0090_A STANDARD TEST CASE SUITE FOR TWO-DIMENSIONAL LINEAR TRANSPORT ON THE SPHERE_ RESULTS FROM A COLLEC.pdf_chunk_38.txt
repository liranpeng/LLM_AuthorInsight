This means that the discretization scheme for Eq. (1) reduces
to the discretization scheme for Eq. (2) for φ = 1 as it triv-
ially does in continuous space. Note that free-stream preserv-
ing does not necessarily mean that the spatial and temporal
discretization schemes for ρ and ρφ are identical. In fact, it
is common practice to solve the tracer transport Eq. (1) on
longer time steps than the air density Eq. (2) since tracer
transport schemes are usually only limited by the advec-
