emissions exceeded modern levels during the Medieval Period (1000–1500 CE) but then decreased substantially during the Little Ice Age (1600–1800 CE), indicating the sensitivity of biomass burning to climate during the preindustrial era. Such positive feedbacks between biomass burning and climate may make it difficult to achieve societal climate goals. Biomass burning drives changes in greenhouse gases, climate-forcing aerosols, and global atmospheric chemistry. There is controversy about the
