(labeled ND in Fig. 10) obtained on RF02 show much higher aerosol and cloud droplet 
number concentrations in the eastern part of the low-level sampling areas than those to the 
west. For a trajectory starting area sampled on the first part of the outbound RF02 flight, the 
boundary layer UHSAS aerosol concentrations are about 760 cm−3 and the concentrations 
above the boundary layer are about 450 cm−3. In the same air mass sampled on the return
