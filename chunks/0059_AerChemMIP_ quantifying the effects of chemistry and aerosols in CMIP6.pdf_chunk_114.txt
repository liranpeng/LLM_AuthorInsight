2.6 scenario. The transient ERFs calculated with respect to
the ssp370SST control will include the effects of albedo
changes as well as NTCFs. The pair ssp370SST–ssp370SST-
ssp126Lu are the prescribed SST equivalents of the coupled-
ocean Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP)
pair ssp370–ssp370-ssp126Lu (Lawrence et al., 2016).
The total simulation years requested are 82 for Tier 1 and
205 for Tier 2.
