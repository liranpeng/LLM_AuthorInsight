multiple sources and sinks that drive the atmospheric burden of N2O, 
their uncertainties, and interactions between anthropogenic forcing 
and natural fluxes of N2O as an emerging climate feedback.
The global N2O budget (2007â€“2016)
The bottom-up and top-down approaches give consistent estimates 
of global total N2O emissions in the decade between 2007 and 2016 
to well within their respective uncertainties, with values of 17.0 (mini-
