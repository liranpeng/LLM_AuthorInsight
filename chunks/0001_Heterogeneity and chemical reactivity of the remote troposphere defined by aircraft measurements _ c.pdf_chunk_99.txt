tral Paciﬁc (RFs 3, 4, and 5) because we are looking for con-
tiguous latitude-by-pressure structures.
In the central Paciﬁc (Fig. 2a, d, g), highly reactive (hot)
P-O3 parcels (> 6 ppb d−1) occur in larger, connected air
masses at latitudes 20–22◦N and pressure altitudes 2–3 km
and in more scattered parcels (> 3 ppb d−1) below 5 km
down to 20◦S. High L-O3 and L-CH4 coincide with this
20–22◦N air mass and also with some high P-O3 at lower
