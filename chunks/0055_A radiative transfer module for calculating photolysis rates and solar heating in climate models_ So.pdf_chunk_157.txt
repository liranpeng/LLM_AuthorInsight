timized for the Xeon Phi on the Babbage test platform at
DOE National Energy Research Scientiﬁc Computing Center
(NERSC) and achieved ∼3 times faster speedups with only
a subset of the cores.
Great computational acceleration could be realized with
GPU systems when a number of column atmospheres are be-
ing simultaneously evaluated. For each grid cell, Solar-J cal-
culates about 100 wavelength bins and an average of 2.75
ICAs per grid square. Giving each CPU/GPU node a 3 × 3
