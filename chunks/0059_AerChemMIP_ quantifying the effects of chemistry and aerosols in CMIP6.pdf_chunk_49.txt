the Antarctic sea ice response (WMO, 2014). Hence there
is a need for a multi-model ensemble of simulations that
resolve stratospheric chemistry to isolate the role of strato-
spheric ozone depletion.

How might future policies (on climate, air quality
and land use) affect the abundances of NTCFs and
their climate impacts?
In the upcoming decades, policies that will impact atmo-
spheric chemistry can be categorised into three broad areas:
