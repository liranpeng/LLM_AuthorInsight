combination was performed within the experiment directly, which is what is plotted here. The UKCA model used, did not model stratospheric water vapor
changes. Black dots mark areas where changes between the control and perturbed run are not signiﬁcant. Signiﬁcance is here deﬁned as 95% or more of
the points with same latitude and height agree on the sign of the change. Because of different perturbation magnitudes in GFDL-emi, GFDL, and OsloCTM-
