based on how they are used in the reference physics-based simulation. The diagnostic variables do
not inform the next step, which is typical for physics-based atmospheric models and has the important
benefit that fields such as precipitation are not necessary to initialize a simulation. However, because
3Code, data and model weights are publicly available; see https://github.com/ai2cm/ace.
