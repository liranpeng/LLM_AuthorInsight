in the range 3 ± 1.5 ◦C, as was estimated by Charney et al. (1979).
Median sensitivity in recent model inter-comparisons is 3.2 ◦C (An-
drews et al., 2012; Vial et al., 2013).
clude effects of “slow” climate feedbacks such as change in
ice sheet size. There is increasing evidence that some slow
feedbacks can be triggered within decades, so they must be
given major consideration in establishing the dangerous level
of human-made climate interference. We thus incorporate
