respectively. The standard deviation is adjusted with a factor
√(1 + 1/n) (see Eq. 15 in ref. 55) so that a ratio of one represents a
perfectly tuned model. b, d, f, h show the corresponding rank
histograms for the same channels.

Case studies: downscaling coherent structures
We now turn our attention to specific weather regimes, which are
important to examine since aggregate skill scores and spectra can be
more easily gamed and mask symptoms of spatial incoherence.
