described in Rauber et al, (2017) and in Schwartz et al. (2018). It is a pulsed Doppler radar 
that operates at a 95 GHz frequency (3 mm wavelength) and has a sensitivity of âˆ’39.6 dBZ 
at 1 km range. The HCR in CSET was operated with a temporal resolution of 0.5 sec, which 
for air speeds of the GV gives a horizontal resolution of 50-100 m. The vertical range 
resolution of 20 m makes the HCR ideal for observing stratocumulus and cumulus clouds
