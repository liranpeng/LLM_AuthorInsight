comparable computational costs to either QCA).
The AvQCA model comes easily from the MdQCA for-
malism, but all ICAs in each of the four total optical depth
domains are used to calculate the average cloud-water con-
tent in each QCA. The AvDir model calculates the weighted
direct solar beam from each ICA, where only 600 nm cloud
extinction is included. In this case it was found that an equiv-
alent isotropic extinction is needed as in two-stream methods
