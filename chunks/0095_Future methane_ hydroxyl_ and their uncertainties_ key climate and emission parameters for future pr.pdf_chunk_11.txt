Global climate model (GCM) simulations with atmo-
spheric chemistry provide another method for predicting fu-
ture methane and other chemically reactive GHGs. An en-
semble of such models can provide a range of future methane
abundances for a single scenario (e.g. Atmospheric Chem-
istry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP)
Lamarque et al., 2012), spanning some, but likely not all, fu-
ture uncertainties. This approach is computationally expen-
