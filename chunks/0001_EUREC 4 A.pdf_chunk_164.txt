surements by Caravela (an AutoNaut) and three underwater
gliders characterized the air–sea interface in a small, and spa-
tially ﬁxed, (ca. 10 km) region in this domain (Fig. 17). These
measurements help untangle spatial from temporal variabil-
ity, with both a secular (seasonal) cooling of surface waters
over the course of the campaign and a variable, but at times
pronounced, diel cycle (Fig. 17). In addition, CTD casts,
