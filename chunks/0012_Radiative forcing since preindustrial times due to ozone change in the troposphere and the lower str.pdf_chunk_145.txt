explicitly. The radiative forcing calculations are made by the UiO-RTM, and the tropopause level is based on the NCEP year 2000 reanalysis.
1850 and 2000. In general, the net forcing from stratospheric
ozone change is negative in middle to high latitudes, with
magnitudes increasing with latitude. In low latitudes, how-
ever, the net radiative forcing can be positive. This is where
the ozone depletion is located at rather high altitudes result-
