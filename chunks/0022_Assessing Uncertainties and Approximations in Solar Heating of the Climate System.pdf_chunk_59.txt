computed with 5–10 broad bands and probably does not need the 20 g-points of RRTMG. One must remem-
ber that clouds and aerosols are also important for the 721 W m−2 in the UV-VIS. Clouds have little spectral 
dependence in the UV-VIS and can thus be calculated accurately with very broad bands. Aerosols extinction 
often scales inversely with wavelength (see Figure 2) and thus aerosol radiative forcing of climate needs to 
be resolved by the broad band structure and not with g-points.
