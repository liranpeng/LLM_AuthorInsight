planetary energy balance, and GHG changes, differs from a
common optimistic perception of progress toward stabilizing
climate. That optimism may be based on the lowered warm-
ing target in the Paris Agreement (2015), slowdown in the
growth of global fossil fuel emissions in the past few years
(Fig. A1), and falling prices of renewable energies, but the
hard reality of the climate physics emerges in Figs. 2, 5, 8
and 14. Although the scenarios employed in climate simu-
