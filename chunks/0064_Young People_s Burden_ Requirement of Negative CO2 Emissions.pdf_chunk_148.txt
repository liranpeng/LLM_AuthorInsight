extraction of 339–1270 PgC from the atmosphere (Fig. 10b).
However, these scenarios still yield warming more than
1.5 ◦C above the preindustrial level (more than 1 ◦C above
the early Holocene maximum). Consequences of such warm-
ing and the plausibility of extracting such huge amounts of
atmospheric CO2 are considered below.

CO2 extraction: estimated cost and alternatives
Extraction of CO2 from the air, also called negative emis-
sions or carbon dioxide removal (CDR), is required if
