in the extratropics. In contrast, road emissions are largely
released into an environment already affected by emissions
from other sources both of natural (soils, lightning) and an-
thropogenic origin. The different effects on OH from road
and ship trafÔ¨Åc in the boundary layer are presented in Fig. 11
showing the 1NOx and 1OH perturbations for road and ship
emissions, respectively. Coloured data points are indicative
for low NOx conditions (< 20 pptv) in different latitude
