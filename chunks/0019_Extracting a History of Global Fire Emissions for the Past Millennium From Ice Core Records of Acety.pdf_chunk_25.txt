and until co‐measurements of all these gases are made in the same ice core, it may be challenging to resolve.
Here we focus on comparing the ice core acetylene, ethane, and methane records to determine if all three
gases are consistent with a single ﬁre history (dry matter burned per year) for the past 1,000 years. We utilize
a base case in which the spatial/seasonal distribution of biomass burning and emission factors are ﬁxed at
