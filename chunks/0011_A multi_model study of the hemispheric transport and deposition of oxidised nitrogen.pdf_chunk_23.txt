cursor gases (SO2, CO, NMVOC and NOx) were reduced
by 20% in each of the four source regions were also
analysed. A comparison of these two series of experiments
will illustrate the impact of any non-linearities in the
chemistry of the different models. The ratio of the concen-
trations of NOx to VOCs will clearly be different in the
source region between the two sets of experiments, which in
turn might impact on the proportions of the different NOy
