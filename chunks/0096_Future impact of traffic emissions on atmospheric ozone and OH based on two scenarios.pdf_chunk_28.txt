variables are identical meaning the inter-model differences

Model descriptions have been given in H2011 and are brieﬂy
summarized here:
1. TM4 (Williams et al., 2010) was operated by KNMI and
applied at a horizontal resolution of 3◦× 2◦and with 34
vertical layers.
2. The p-TOMCAT model (O’Connor et al., 2005) was im-
