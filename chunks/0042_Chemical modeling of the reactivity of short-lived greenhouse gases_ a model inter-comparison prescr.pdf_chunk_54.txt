why it has so much scatter in L-O3 and L-CH4 (see discus-
sion of T and q later); GFDL has similar scatter (see T and
q) but also has a low-bias in L-O3; and GISS has many dif-
ferences that can be examined. As a cross-model question,
are the above-the-line (UCI) and below-the-line (GSFC) dif-
ferences in P -O3 and L-CH4 related to the same pattern in
J-NO2?
A simple summary of these statistics – averages and rms
differences relative to the reference case – is given in Table 3.
