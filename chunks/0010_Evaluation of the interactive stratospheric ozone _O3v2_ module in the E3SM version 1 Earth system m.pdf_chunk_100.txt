Discussion and conclusions
The E3SMv1 model has built capabilities for climate mod-
elling of the water cycle, biogeochemistry, and cryosphere
(Golaz et al., 2019; Rasch et al., 2019). In a next-stage de-
velopment that focuses on atmospheric chemistry, we re-
examined the current modelâ€™s treatment of ozone (O3v1) and
found some errors in the design that led to unphysically large
