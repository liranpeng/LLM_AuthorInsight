ND). Obviously, any set of parcels can be traced. LPM traces
quadrilaterals of a cubed-sphere mesh or the triangles of an
icosahedral triangular mesh by both tracing the centers and
vertices of the control volumes. The parcel trajectories are
computed using a fourth-order Rungeâ€“Kutta method.

Series-expansion methods
Transport scheme algorithms in which the solution is pro-
jected onto a set of basis functions through a minimization
procedure are broadly referred to as series-expansion meth-
