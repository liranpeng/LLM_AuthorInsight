(Methods, Extended Data Fig. 2).
With this extensive data and bottom-up/top-down framework, we 
established comprehensive global and regional N2O budgets that 
include 18 sources and various different chemical sinks. These sources 
and sinks are further grouped into six categories (Fig. 1, Table 1): (1) natu-
ral sources (no anthropogenic effects) including a very small biogenic 
surface sink; (2) perturbed fluxes from ecosystems induced by changes
