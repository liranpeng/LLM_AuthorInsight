such the number of zonal grid points is 360/1λ. For the 1.5◦
grid resolution, time steps of T/2400 and T/480 are used
for the CN ≈0.2 and CN ≈1.2 simulations, respectively. For
the 0.75◦grid resolution, the time steps T/7200 and T/960
are used for the CN ≈0.2 and CN ≈1.2 simulations, respec-
tively.
There are no explicit diffusion parameters in the CAM-FV
transport scheme. However, there is implicit diffusion from
the PPM algorithm used with the Lin–Rood scheme (Lin and
