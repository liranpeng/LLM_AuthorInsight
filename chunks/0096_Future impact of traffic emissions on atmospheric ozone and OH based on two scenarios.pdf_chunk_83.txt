negative net RF for ROAD in 2050 A1B, the relatively large
standard deviation indicates that the magnitude and even the
sign of the net forcing is uncertain.

Synthesis of RF in various scenarios
We present here a synthesis of transport-induced RF in var-
ious scenarios based on results from the same set of atmo-
spheric chemistry models, each using the same setup and
emissions data. The models and setup have been described in
Myhre et al. (2011), H2011, and Sect. 2 in this paper, while
