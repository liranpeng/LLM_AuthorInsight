large, long-term excursion of global temperature above its
Holocene range is to be averted, as shown above. In estimat-
ing the cost and plausibility of CO2 extraction we distinguish
between (1) carbon extracted from the air by improved agri-
cultural and forestry practices, and (2) additional “technolog-
ical extraction” by intensive negative emission technologies.
We assume that improved practices will aim at optimizing
agricultural and forest carbon uptake via relatively natural
