Climate Model Initiative (CCMI; Eyring et al., 2013a). In
contrast to CMIP3, where half of the models prescribed a
constant stratospheric ozone climatology, the CMIP5 mod-
els all considered time-varying ozone either prescribed or
calculated interactively (Eyring et al., 2013b). This has led
to substantial improvements in the representation of climate
forcing by stratospheric ozone in climate models since the
