we present a brief overview of those papers to help the
reader understand the basis for this paper. The ﬁrst ATom
modeling paper (“Global atmospheric chemistry – which air
matters”, Prather et al., 2017, hence P2017) gathered six
global models, both chemistry–transport models (CTMs) and
chemistry–climate models (CCMs). The models reported a
single-day snapshot for mid-August (the time of the ﬁrst
ATom deployment, ATom-1), and these included all species
