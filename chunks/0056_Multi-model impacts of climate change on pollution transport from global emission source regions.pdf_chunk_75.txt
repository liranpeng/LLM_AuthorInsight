deep convection and on jet stream locations is outlined here
in relation to the seasonal CO-tracer redistributions described
above. The increase in tropopause height under CO2 warm-
ing and its inﬂuence on CO-tracer distributions is also eluci-
dated. Modiﬁcations to these transport processes have impli-
cations for pollutant transport from major source regions in
the future.
