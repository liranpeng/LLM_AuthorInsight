duces large reductions in P-O3 for all cumulative weights and
small reductions in L-CH4 for the upper 5th percentile. We
conclude that accurate modeling of chemical composition of
the 80th and greater percentiles is important but that mod-
est errors in the lowest 50th percentile are inconsequential;
effectively, some parcels matter more than others (P2017).
How well does this ATom analysis work as a model in-
tercomparison project? Overall, we Ô¨Ånd that most models
