settings. To facilitate this process further, we provide scripts
for contour plots. Model developers are encouraged to use
those scripts so that contour plots from different modeling
groups can easily be compared.
More challenging global idealized tests have been devel-
oped since the efforts of Williamson et al. (1992) such as
the highly deformational (moving) vortices on the sphere
(Nair and Machenhauer, 2002; Nair and Jablonowski, 2008)
and the “boomerang” ﬂows of Nair and Lauritzen (2010).
