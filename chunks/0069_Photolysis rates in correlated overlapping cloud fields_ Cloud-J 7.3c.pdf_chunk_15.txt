overlap (RAN). In this case the likelihood (fractional weight,
w) of having the cloud in layer L1 fall below the cloud in
layer L2 is random and hence equals f L1. This particular
pairing – cloud below cloud – becomes ICA #1. Superscripts
in the equations below refer to atmospheric layers. The like-
lihood for the clear layer under the cloudy layer is by default
f L2 =
 
20% cloudy     
              1 -
= 80% clear
f
= 15% cloudy                   1 - f
= 85% clear
