oceans. Background concentrations of ozone, NOx and other
NMHCs are low, and the solar irradiation and water vapor
available for OH formation are high. The recycling potential
of OH by NOx is lower than over the continents and is efﬁ-
ciently enhanced by ship emissions. The reason is that at al-
ready enhanced NOx levels the reaction of OH with NO2 be-
comes a signiﬁcant sink of hydroxyl radicals, which is not the
case in the NOx-poor marine boundary layer. On the other
