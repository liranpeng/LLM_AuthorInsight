water reactors are in the range USD 2000â€“3000 per kilo-
watt (Chinese Academy of Engineering, 2015; Lovering et
al., 2016). Although in some countries reactor costs stabi-
lized or declined with repeated construction of the same re-
actor design, in others costs have risen for a variety of rea-
sons (Lovering et al., 2016). Using USD 2500 per kilowatt
as reactor cost and assuming 85 % capacity factor (percent
uptime for reactors) yields a cost of USD 10 trillion to pro-
