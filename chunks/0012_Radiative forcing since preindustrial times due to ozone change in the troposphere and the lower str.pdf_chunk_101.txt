crease of 9.8 DU and a standard deviation of 1.6 DU. The
relatively large ozone increase in the UM CAM model re-
vealed in Fig. 2 is reï¬‚ected in the tropospheric ozone column
as well, with an increase of almost 14 DU. Horizontal maps
of tropospheric column change (not shown) reveal an in-
crease throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and in low and
mid latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. In high South-
ern latitudes, most models show regional decreases, in two
