AOTs at different wavelengths, and deposition rates (includ-
ing wet and dry deposition of nitrates and sulfates, dust, and
BC). The hourly and 6-hourly model output (contained in
aerhourly and aer-6h tables) is requested speciﬁcally for the
DECK AMIP simulations (1979–2014) and is not needed
for other experiments. The other variables are included as
being essential for forcing, feedback, chemistry–climate in-
teractions and air quality analysis. Outputting such variables
