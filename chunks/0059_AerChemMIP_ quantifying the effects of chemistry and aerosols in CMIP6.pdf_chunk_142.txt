Forcing
For better documentation of which forcing is actually present
in a given climate model, several sets of diagnostics are
needed: (1) ﬂux parameters providing ERF from ﬁxed SST
simulations, (2) 3-D mass mixing ratios and optical thick-
ness in transient simulations, and (3) repeated aerosol-free
calls to the radiation code (with aerosol scattering and ab-
sorption set to zero) in transient climate simulations (Ghan et
