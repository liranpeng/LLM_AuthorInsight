allows for long time steps as long as the trajectory algo-
rithm converges (Lipschitz criterion). FARSIGHT performs
best at Courant numbers of 10–20 and has large errors at
low Courant numbers (White and Dongarra, 2011). Schemes
based on Eq. (10) are usually not inherently mass conserva-
tive, and it is common practice to apply global mass ﬁxers
that “ad hoc” restore global mass conservation. FARSIGHT
uses a global mass ﬁxer that also locally constrains the mix-
