reactions in the upper troposphere where thermal decompo-
sition in inconsequential. It is possible that some of the high
concentrations of HNO4 and PAN in the lower troposphere
are real and that we are missing this large source of NOx
with the RDSâˆ—protocol, but there are no obvious sources of
these species in the remote oceanic regions that would pro-
duce enough to match the thermal loss. Both this problem
and its solution do not affect the initial NOx. This revised
