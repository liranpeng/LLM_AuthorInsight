aerosols, both in the models and in CAFS. If clear sky in-
cludes aerosols then TUV must be able to infer an aerosol
proﬁle for all measurements, and likewise the models need
to be careful in how they calculate cloudy–clear ratios. Fortu-
nately for most of the oceanic ATom measurements, aerosol
optical depths are small, but where they are large (e.g., Sa-
haran dust events) the daily satellite mapping should pro-
vide adequate coverage for the TUV modeling. Developing
