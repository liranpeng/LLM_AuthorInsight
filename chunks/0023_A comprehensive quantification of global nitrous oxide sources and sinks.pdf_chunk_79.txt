changes, the effect of which on the global atmospheric N2O growth 
rate was previously unknown. These interactions include the effects 
of climate change, increasing atmospheric CO2 and deforestation. 
Cumulatively, these exert a relatively small effect on the overall increase 
in N2O concentrations; however, individual flux components—such as 
the increasing positive climate–N2O feedback—are considerable. These 
fluxes are not currently included when reporting national greenhouse
