is considerably larger than the IPCC Tier 1 default for direct emission of 
1%. This higher emission factor, derived from process-based models, 
suggests a strong interactive effect between nitrogen additions and other 
global environmental changes (Table 1, ‘Perturbed fluxes from climate, 
atmospheric CO2 and land cover change’). Previous field experiments 
reported a better fit to local observations of soil N2O emissions when
