One study suggests that ozone production due to aircraft
emissions may be reduced by 10–25 % in the Northern Hemi-
sphere when subgrid-scale plume effects are taken into ac-
count (Cariolle et al., 2009), and another study suggests a
similar reduction for ship emissions – around 10–30 % over
parts of the North Atlantic Ocean (Huszar et al., 2010). Al-
though there are relatively large uncertainties related to the
