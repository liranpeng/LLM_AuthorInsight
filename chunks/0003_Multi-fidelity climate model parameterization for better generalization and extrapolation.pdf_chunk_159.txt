of interest when compared to data distributions of HF training and testing data. Similarly, the CAM5 +4K is not informative
neither as the corresponding data spans a similar interval to the CAM5 +8K dataset. For other vertical levels, the CAM5 +8K
simulation dataset does extrapolate beyond the HF training data (see Methods). These datasets distributions explain the overall
lower performance observed for LF-RPN and MF-RPN models when it comes to infer the moisture tendency at the lowest
