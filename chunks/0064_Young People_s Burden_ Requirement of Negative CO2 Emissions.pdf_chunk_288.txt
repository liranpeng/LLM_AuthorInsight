Niño 3.4 temperatures. Temperatures are relative to 1951–1980 base period for the current GISTEMP analysis, which uses NOAA ERSST.v4
for sea surface temperature. (b) Global surface temperature relative to 1951–1980 in the GISTEMP analysis, comparing the current analysis
using NOAA ERSST.v4 for sea surface temperature with results using ERSST.v3b. (c) Temperature anomalies in three periods relative
