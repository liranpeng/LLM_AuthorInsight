polation points, temperature, or pressure of the cross sections.
We assume that the 12:00 LT J’s (clear-sky, tropical atmosphere,
albedo = 0.10, SZA = 15◦) apply for 8 of 24 h. Equivalent rates for
OH loss are shown with the species name in the legend and assume
a 12:00 LT OH density of 6 × 106 cm−3. Asterisks denote species
for which photolysis loss is greater than or comparable to OH loss.
VOC abbreviations are MGlyxl: methyl glyoxal, Glyxl: glyoxal,
