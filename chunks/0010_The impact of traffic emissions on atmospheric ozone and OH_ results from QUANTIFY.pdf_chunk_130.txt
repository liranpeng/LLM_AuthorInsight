on OH in the upper troposphere of the northern extratropics
during summer. Despite the fact that the absolute perturba-
tion is about a factor of 2 lower during winter, the relative
perturbation exceeds 0.6% (or 12% scaled). The larger rela-
tive change during northern winter is due to the strong sea-
sonal variation of the background latitudinal OH distribution.
During winter the extratropical zonal mean OH at 300 hPa is
less than 5Â·103 molecules/cm3, whereas in summer the mean
