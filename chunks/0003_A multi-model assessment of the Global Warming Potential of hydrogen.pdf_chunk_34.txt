vapor. The model mean hydrogen GWP100 is 11.6 ± 2.8 (one
standard deviation). The largest contribution is from changes in
methane (44%), followed by ozone (38%) and stratospheric water
vapor (18%). The reported GWP100 does not include any aerosol
effects which are consistent with IPCC reporting. The number
11.6 ± 2.8 (one standard deviation) is comparable to Warwick
et al.16 (12 ± 6) and Hauglustaine et al.13 (12.8 ± 5.2, 90% con-
ﬁdence interval), but twice as high as previously published
