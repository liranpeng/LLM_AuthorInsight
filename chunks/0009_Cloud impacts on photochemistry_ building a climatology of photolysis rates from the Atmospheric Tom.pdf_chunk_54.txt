some models have ratios close to 1 throughout the tropo-
sphere (especially in the Tropics) while others have ratios
> 1.1 at altitudes above 800 hPa and < 0.9 below 900 hPa. In a
recent model intercomparison with speciﬁed chemical abun-
dances (Prather et al., 2018), we found that the tropospheric
photochemistry of O3 and CH4 responded almost linearly
to cloudy–clear changes in J values (see Fig. S4; data not
shown in Prather et al., 2018). Thus the differing impact of
