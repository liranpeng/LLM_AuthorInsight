follow deﬁnitions made in IPCC AR5 (Boucher et al., 2013;
Myhre et al., 2013b). The consideration of rapid adjustments
associated with aerosols for the various models is described
in Table 1.
Radiative forcing is deﬁned as a perturbation relative to
a reference state; this can be a ﬂexible year and most com-
mon to pre-industrial time (Boucher et al., 2013; Myhre et
al., 2013b). All the aerosol and ozone forcings shown here
are absolute changes (W m−2) relative to the 1990 value of
