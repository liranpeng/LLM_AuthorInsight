loss and how these reactivities are distributed in large semi-
hemispheric zones throughout the troposphere (GrifÔ¨Åths et
al., 2021; Myhre et al., 2014; Naik et al., 2013; Prather et
al., 2001; Stevenson, et al., 2006, 2013, 2020; Voulgarakis
et al., 2013; Young et al., 2013). The models used in these
assessments disagree on these overall CH4 and O3 reactiv-
ities (a.k.a. the budgets), and resolving the cause of such
differences is stymied because of the large number of pro-
