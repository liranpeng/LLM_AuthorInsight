of this paper are to identify and characterize differences in
model-generated reactivities as well as species covariances
that could readily be discriminated with an unbiased clima-
tology. A primary tool is comparison of multidimensional
probability densities of key species weighted by the mass of
such parcels or frequency of occurrence as well as by the re-
activity of the parcels with respect to methane and ozone.
The reactivity-weighted probabilities tell us which parcels
