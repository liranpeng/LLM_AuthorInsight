In a nutshell, K-means clustering alternates between assigning the (dimensionality-reduced) data points zi 
to K cluster centers µk based on euclidean distance, and updating the cluster locations µk (setting them to the 
mean of the assigned data). To formalize the algorithm, one frequently defines the cluster assignment variables 
mi ∈{1, . . . , K} , indicating which cluster data point zi belongs to. A measure of convergence is the inertia,
