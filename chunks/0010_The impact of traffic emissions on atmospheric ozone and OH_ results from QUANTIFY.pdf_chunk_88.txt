to our results can be explained by the use of different emis-
sions, which are based on the EDGAR 1990 fuel estimates
in Matthes et al. (2007) and are about 25% higher for NOx
from road than in this study. The inverted sensitivity of ozone
to road emissions during winter is also reported by Niemeier
et al. (2006) with the maximum effect over Europe exceeding
25% at the surface. The latter effect is simulated by all Ô¨Åve
models in our study, which contribute to the average shown
