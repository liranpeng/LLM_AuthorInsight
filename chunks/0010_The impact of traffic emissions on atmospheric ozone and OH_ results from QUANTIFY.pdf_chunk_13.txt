during northern summer over the northern Atlantic and Pa-
ciﬁc regions. Eyring et al. (2007) used a multi-model ap-
proach based on EDGAR emissions and reported somewhat
lower values of 5–6 ppbv for the North Atlantic. They also
calculated a maximum column perturbation of 1 DU for the
tropospheric ozone column associated with radiative forcings
of 9.8 mW/m2. For road emissions Matthes et al. (2007)
found maximum contributions to surface ozone peaking at
