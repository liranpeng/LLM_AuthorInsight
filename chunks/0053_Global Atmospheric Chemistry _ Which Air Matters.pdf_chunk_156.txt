(Fig. 7), we can ﬁnd that this region is important for methane
and ozone loss. Some work remains in establishing just how
close is good enough in matching 2-D (and multi-D) proba-
bility distributions of the key species, although the overlap of
the 2-D ﬁtted ellipses begins to address this.
There are other ATom measurements beyond just key
species that might prove useful as climatological tests for the
models. The OH loss frequency (L-OH, Sinha et al., 2008;
