spheric chemistry (Oslo CTM3), we calculate the strato-
spheric chemical effects of methane, including those medi-
ated by water vapor. Combining the troposphere and strato-
sphere results, the total methane-induced ozone RF is 50 %
of the direct methane RF. Based on these data, the 100-yr
methane GWP is 32, which is higher than several previous
estimates around 25.
