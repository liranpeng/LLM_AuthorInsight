ratio. The HEL scheme is general in the sense that any shape-
preserving and mass-conservative scheme can be used for the
Eulerian forecast. The HEL scheme has also been tested suc-
cessfully in a dynamic shallow water model with strongly
varying surface topography (Kaas et al., 2013).

(Semi-)Lagrangian grid point
Some

such
as
traditional
grid-point
semi-
Lagrangian schemes, are based on the advective form of the
continuity equation for mixing ratio φ,
