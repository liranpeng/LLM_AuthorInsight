likely to be evident through the statistical patterns of the key
species, rather than simply via average proﬁles. The under-
lying design of ATom was to collect enough data to develop
such a multivariate chemical climatology. As a quick look
across the four deployments, we show the joint 2D PDs on
a logarithmic scale as in P2017 for HOOH versus NOx in
Fig. 7. The patterns for the tropical central Paciﬁc are quite
similar for the four seasons of ATom deployments, and the
