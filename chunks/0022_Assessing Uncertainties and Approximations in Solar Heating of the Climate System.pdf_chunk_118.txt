ative of the convergent error reduction from 2-stream to 4-stream. If we extrapolate to 8-stream, we would 
see the errors in δ-4SHE drop by a factor of 2–4. We looked separately at the error caused by δ-1 scaling of 
ice clouds only and found it to be surprisingly small with global mean differences of < ±0.02 W m−2. So
