direct model in the case of a desert dust outbreak come pri-
marily from the uncertainties in the desert dust emissions.
The dust emission into the atmosphere is a threshold process,
which is very sensitive to uncertainties in the wind ﬁeld. The
small changes in wind can produce signiﬁcant differences in
the emitted quantities. The AOD assimilation proved to be a
technique capable of reducing the effects of such uncertain-
ties in the modelled aerosol ﬁelds.
