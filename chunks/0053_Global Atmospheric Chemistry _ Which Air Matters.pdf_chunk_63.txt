layer, but much of the polluted lamina remains in the larger
domain. As long as the domain retains a statistical mix of
the key chemical species similar to the initialization, then the
reactivity statistics of the C-run should represent the hypo-
thetical reactivity of those initialized parcels.
How can we design a calculation using the CTMsâ€“CCMs
that allows us to initialize a subset of grid cells with observed
air parcels and then calculate a reactivity for those parcels?
