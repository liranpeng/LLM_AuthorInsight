the treatments of gap-ﬁlling and lower limit of detection,
along with other quality controls. With continued analysis of
the unusually reactive eastern Paciﬁc region, we determined
that the method of long-gap ﬁlling for NOx resulted in prop-
agation of high NOx levels from the over-land proﬁles into
the over-water proﬁles in the tropics. We separated these two
set of proﬁles used for long-gap NOx ﬁlling and created an
updated version 2b. This experience points to the importance
