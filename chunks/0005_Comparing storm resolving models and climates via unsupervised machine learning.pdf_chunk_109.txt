discrete ones with increasing confidence. The two data distributions pA(x) and pB(x) result in two distinct cluster 
proportions πA and πB for which we can estimate the KL as
The inequality comes from the fact that any such discrete KL estimate lower-bounds the true KL ­divergence66.
Vector quantization suffers from the curse of dimensionality. To mitigate this issue, we work in the latent
