head, but none of the models come close to the CAFS fre-
quency of these occurrences. In general and as expected, this
brightening above and dimming below is more evident for
J-NO2 than for J-O1D. Another feature that is somewhat
consistent across models and observations is that the wings
of the rlnJ distribution are wider in the North PaciÔ¨Åc than
the Tropics. In the boundary layer, observations and mod-
els show the reverse with greater cloud effects (dimming,
