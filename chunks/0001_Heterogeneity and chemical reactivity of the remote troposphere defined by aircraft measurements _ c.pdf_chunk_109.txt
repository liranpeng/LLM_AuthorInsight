the eastern Paciﬁc and Atlantic at 3–12 km, ATom-1 results
also agree with models but at a higher ozone production of
about 2 ppb d−1. This pattern indicates that in the central Pa-
ciﬁc, the NOx + HOx combination that produces ozone is
suppressed below 2 km in all the models. In the upper tropo-
sphere, 10–12 km, of the eastern Paciﬁc and Atlantic, ATom
P-O3 values show a jump to 3 ppb d−1, which is only partly
reproduced in the models. We take this pattern as evidence
