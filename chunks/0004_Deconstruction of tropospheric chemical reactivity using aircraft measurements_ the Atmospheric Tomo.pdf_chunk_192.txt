Fig. 68 indicate the shifting importance of the d[P-O3]/d[O3]
term with altitude.
Our sensitivity calculations are made with 24 h integra-
tions, and over this time the HOx and NOx radicals read-
just to the O3 increase, other species like HOOH partially re-
spond, and for longer-lived key species such as CO (90 d) the
adjustment is negligible. For O3, the timescales for decay of
the perturbation are 10–30 d, and thus we can ignore to ﬁrst
