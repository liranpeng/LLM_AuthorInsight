second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, so understanding its atmospheric chemistry is essential for the development of models to successfully project climate change. Current models uniformly underestimate the atmospheric lifetime of methane because they uniformly overestimate how much hydroxyl radical (OH), the chemical species responsible for most of the destruction of methane, the atmosphere contains. Prather and Zhu investigated the cause of this discrepancy
