count RF due to changes in O3, CH4 and CH4-induced O3.
This is caused both by the enhanced negative net RF from
SHIP, which will change from −19 ± 5.3 mW m−2 in 2000
to −31 ± 4.8 (B1) or −40 ± 9 mW m−2 (A1B) in 2050, and
from reduced O3 warming from ROAD, which is likely to
turn from a positive net RF of 12 ± 8.5 mW m−2 in 2000 to
a slightly negative net RF of −3.1 ± 2.2 (B1) or −3.1 ± 3.4
(A1B) mW m−2 in the middle of this century. The negative
