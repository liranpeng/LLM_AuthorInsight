positivity preserving limiters will not eliminate undershoots
near the discontinuity.
Contour plots for mixing ratio at t = T /2 based on slot-
ted cylinder initial conditions are shown in Figs. 7, 8, 9, and
10 (again, data are grouped according to the discretization
grid). In the LSPT2012 test case, speciÔ¨Åcation modelers were
asked to report on conventional error norms (at t = T ) in ad-
dition to showing contour plots (at t = T/2). Here we have
