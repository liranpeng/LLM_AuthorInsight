liver the correct mean when averaged enough times over the same cloud system, but it has hourly grid-cell 
rms errors of 40 W m−2 (H. W. Barker et al., 2008; Pincus et al., 2003). A key underlying premise is that solar 
heating errors propagate symmetrically and linearly in the climate system and average out, as was found 
for simple forecast models. Assessing net bias errors caused by noisy heating rates would need to examine
