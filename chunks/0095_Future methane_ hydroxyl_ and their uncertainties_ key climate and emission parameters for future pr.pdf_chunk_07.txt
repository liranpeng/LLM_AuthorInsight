changes in the largest atmospheric methane sink, oxidation
by tropospheric OH: anthropogenic emissions of CO, nitro-
gen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
and the negative feedback between methane abundance and
tropospheric OH (Prather et al., 2001). Other sinks, which in-
clude oxidation in the stratosphere, oxidation by tropospheric
chlorine, and uptake into soil, were assessed but assumed not
to change during the 21st century projections. For the upcom-
