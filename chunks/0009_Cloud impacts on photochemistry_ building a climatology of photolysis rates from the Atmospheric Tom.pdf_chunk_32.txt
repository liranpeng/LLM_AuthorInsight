3-D tropospheric chemistry models appeared, the need for
computationally efÔ¨Åcient J-value codes led to some models
ignoring clouds and others estimating cloud layers and ap-
plying correction factors to clear-sky Js. With the release of
Fast-J (Wild et al., 2000), some 3-D models started using a
J-value code that directly simulated cloud and aerosol scat-
tering properties with few approximations. The next com-
plexity, based on general circulation modeling, included frac-
