for cloud particles, particularly ice crystals (Zhou and Yang,
2015). Li et al. (2015) Ô¨Ånd biases caused by the HG phase
function and conclude that higher-order moments of the
phase function coupled with a multi-stream radiative trans-
fer algorithms are needed to improve accuracy. They demon-
strate this point with a four-stream delta-Eddington code de-

tested the accuracy of different-order codes for computing
