Global temperature is a useful metric, because increasing
temperature drives amplifying feedbacks. Global ocean tem-
perature is a major factor affecting ice sheet size, as indi-
cated by both model studies (Pollard et al., 2015) and pa-
leoclimate analyses (Overpeck et al., 2006; Hansen et al.,
2016). Eemian ocean warmth, probably not more than about
