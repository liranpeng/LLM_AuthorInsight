state. The dataset is global and spans ten years at a high sampling frequency. We provide a cross-platform, containerized pipeline to integrate ML models into operational climate simulators for hybrid testing. We also implement various ML baselines, alongside a hybrid baseline simulator, to highlight the ML challenges of building stable, skillful emulators. The data (https://huggingface.co/datasets/LEAP/ClimSim_high-res) and code (https://leap-stc.github.io/ClimSim and
