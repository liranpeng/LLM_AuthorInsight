has been better determined (Boucher et al., 2013). As a con-
sequence, efforts to accurately represent aerosols in models
also increased (for example Kanakidou et al., 2005; Textor
et al., 2006; Fuzzi et al., 2006; Vignati et al., 2010; Lee et al.,
2011; Boucher et al., 2013; SiË‡c et al., 2015). The develop-
ment of aerosol modelling enables us to better understand
how aerosols affect atmospheric chemistry, air quality, cli-
mate, aviation, visibility, radiative budget and clouds. Still,
