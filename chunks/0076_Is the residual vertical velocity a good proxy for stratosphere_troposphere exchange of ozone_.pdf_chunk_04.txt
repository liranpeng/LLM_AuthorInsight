an isosurface in artiﬁcial tracer e90 representing the tropopause. Hemispheric ﬂuxes derived from the ozone
mass budget of the lowermost stratosphere yield similar results. Use of the Brewer-Dobson residual
vertical velocity as a scaled proxy for ozone ﬂux, however, fails to capture the interannual variability. Thus,
the common notion that the strength of stratospheric overturning circulation is a good measure for global
