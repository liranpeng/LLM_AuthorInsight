proven efficacious in non-acute musculoskeletal conditions 
[42, 43].
Six studies [24–28, 30] demonstrated that the use of 
BCTs significantly increased the risk of an adverse event 
after operatively-treated ankle fracture (RR 1.7 (CI 1.16 to 
2.49)). This equates to 72 more complications per 1,000 
patients treated (16 to 153). However, this is unlikely to 
represent an issue with BCTs because the studies had sub-
stantial non-BCT components, and five studies [24–27, 30]
