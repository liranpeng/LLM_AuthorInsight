values in the scattering regions (VIS and IR bands #S19-22) for SSA (FigureÂ 3a) and g, but we calculate about 
10% more extinction for the same effective diameter and ice water content. We were not able to implement 
the new RRTMG(BY) code in Solar-J and can only assess their published results: RRTMG(BY) has weaker
