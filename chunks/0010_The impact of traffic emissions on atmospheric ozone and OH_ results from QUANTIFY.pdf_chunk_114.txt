each transport sector we normalised the additional annual
mean ozone burden of each sector to the respective number
of NOx molecules emitted. As evident from Table 6 road
and ship emissions have similar efﬁciencies to perturb ozone.
However, the NOx emissions from air trafﬁc are almost three
times as efﬁcient in producing ozone as those from ships.
Since these emissions take place in the UTLS region the life-
time of the reservoir species HNO3 and PAN are much longer
