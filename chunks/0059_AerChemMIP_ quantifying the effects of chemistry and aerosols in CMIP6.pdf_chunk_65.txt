interactive tropospheric chemistry, the Tier 1 ...NTCF and
Tier 2 . . . Aer simulations will be identical, and so only need
to be run once. Models capable of running with both interac-
tive chemistry and aerosols should do so for all experiments.
To participate in AerChemMIP, climate models must be
run for the CMIP DECK and CMIP6 historical (atmosphere–
ocean simulation with forcings evolving over 1850–2014)
experiments with the same setup as in AerChemMIP, i.e. with
