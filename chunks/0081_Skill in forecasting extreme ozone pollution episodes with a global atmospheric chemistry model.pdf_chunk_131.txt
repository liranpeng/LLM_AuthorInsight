years 2005–2006 and gridded EU observations the fractions
are 84 and 67 %, respectively; for the CTM, the fractions are
73 and 42 %, respectively (Fig. 11b). In EU, the events are
clustered into larger-size episodes.
Figure 11 also shows that the decadal climatology (years
2000–2009) of episode sizes (green) is quite different from
the 2 yr climatology (blue) that overlaps with the CTM hind-
cast. Thus, interannual variability is an important factor that
