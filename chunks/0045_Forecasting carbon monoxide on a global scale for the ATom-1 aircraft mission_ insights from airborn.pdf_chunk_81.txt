to each ﬂight for the lower troposphere (pressure >850 hPa)
only (Fig. S7). Asian sources make a larger percent contribu-
tion to the Paciﬁc ﬂights (ﬂights 0–4) when all ﬂight altitudes
are considered rather than the lower troposphere alone. Re-
gional sources such as African biomass burning for ﬂights 6
and 7 and N. American sources for ﬂights 9 and 10 make a
larger percent contribution in the lower troposphere.
