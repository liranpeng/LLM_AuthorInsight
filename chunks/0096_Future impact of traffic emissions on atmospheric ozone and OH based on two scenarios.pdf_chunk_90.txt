and the net RF (bottom row) as mean (coloured bars) and standard deviation (error bars) of the six models in the ensemble. Note that the
time-history of emissions and the stratospheric water vapour effect have been taken into account.
are that higher NRFs (18–19 % higher) and ozone enhance-
ment efﬁciencies (25–63 % higher) were used in their study.
The scaling approach of Lee et al. (2009) yielded even
higher aircraft-induced O3 RF for 2050, with a range 59–
