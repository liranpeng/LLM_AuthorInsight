Also, it is clear from the model results that further model
studies will be needed to investigate the contribution from
climate change to changes in ozone, both in the troposphere
and in the stratosphere, with focus on changes in tempera-
tures, water vapor concentrations, and stratospheric circula-
tion.
Regarding radiative forcing calculations of this type it will
be important in the future to clearly distinguish between ra-
diative forcing due to ozone changes resulting from changing
