All models simulate much stronger forcings for ship emis-
sions compared to Eyring et al. (2007) which is most likely
due to the very different distribution of the emissions, but
also due to lower emission estimates of NOx as stated in
the previous section. Fuglestvedt et al. (2008) obtain forc-
ings of 32±9 mWm−2 for ozone and −43±13 mWm−2 for
methane, which both cover the range of our individual model
