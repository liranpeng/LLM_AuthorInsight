We describe internal, low‐frequency variability in a 21‐year simulation with a cloud‐resolving model. The model domain is the length of the equatorial Pacific and includes a slab ocean, which permits coherent cycles of sea surface temperature (SST), atmospheric convection, and the convectively coupled circulation. The warming phase of the cycle is associated with near‐uniform SST, less organized convection, and sparse low cloud cover, while the cooling phase exhibits strong SST gradients,
