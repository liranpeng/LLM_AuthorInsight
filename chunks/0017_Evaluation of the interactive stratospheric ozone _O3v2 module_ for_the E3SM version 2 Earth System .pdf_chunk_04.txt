Irvine chemistry transport model (UCI CTM) using the same
stratospheric chemistry scheme but driven by European Cen-
tre forecast Ô¨Åelds for the same period. In terms of strato-
spheric column ozone, O3v2 shows reduced mean bias and
improved northern midlatitude variability, but it is not quite
as good as the UCI CTM. As expected, SST-forced E3SMv1
simulations cannot synchronize with observed quasi-biennial
oscillations (QBOs), but they do show the typical QBO pat-
