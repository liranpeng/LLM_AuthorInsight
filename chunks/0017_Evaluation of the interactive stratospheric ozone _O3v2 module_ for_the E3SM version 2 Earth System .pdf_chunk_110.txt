sitivities. We identiﬁed and ﬁxed an error in the stratospheric
ozone model: comparison with new ozone metrics show that
model performance has generally improved, but compari-
son with physical climate metrics shows little change. For
E3SMv1 at least, we ﬁnd that 20 % of the errors in lower
stratospheric ozone affect wave propagation, the tropopause,
and the stability of the Antarctic stratospheric vortex. While
these are readily detectable, they have much less impact on
