line. The AerChemMIP conﬁgured abrupt-4xCO2 should be
run for at least 150 years as recommended in Eyring et
al. (2016a), to quantify the climate–chemistry feedbacks. It
is recommended that modelling groups document the aerosol
and chemistry schemes in their climate model and evaluate
their performance in the DECK AMIP simulation.
