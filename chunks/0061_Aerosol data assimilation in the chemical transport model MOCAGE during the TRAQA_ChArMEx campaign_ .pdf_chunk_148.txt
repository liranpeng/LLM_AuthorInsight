tical depth (AOD). Our system assimilates aerosol optical
depth with the 3-D-FGAT method, and uses the total 3-D
aerosol concentration as a control variable. We examine how
2-D AOD observations in a continuous multicycle assimila-
tion can improve the model aerosol representation, including
the vertical aerosol proÔ¨Åle. We use accurate in situ aircraft
and balloon measurements plus other remotely sensed data
to provide independent validation of the impact of the assim-
