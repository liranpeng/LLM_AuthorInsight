opposite direction with high abundances (> 200 ppt) favoring
L-CH4 and L-O3 but lower ones favoring P-O3, probably be-
cause the lower ones are from the upper troposphere where
colder temperatures suppress both L-CH4 and L-O3 (Fig. 3).
The results from the full probability distribution (Fig. 5) are
mostly represented in the central statistics of Table S5. The
reactivity weighting adds a new dimension to the diagnostics,
and after the ATom dataset becomes available it would be
