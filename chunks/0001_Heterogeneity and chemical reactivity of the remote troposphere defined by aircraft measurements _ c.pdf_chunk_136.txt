(such as seen in some 1 s observations), the majority of vari-
ability in terms of the O3 and CH4 budgets occurs across
scales larger than neighboring 2 km parcels. The PDs mea-
sured in ATom can be largely captured by a global model’s
100 km by 200 m grid cells in the lower troposphere. This
surprising result is evident by comparing the ATom 1D PDs
– both species and reactivities – with those from the mod-
els’ climatologies (Fig. 5). These comparisons show that the
