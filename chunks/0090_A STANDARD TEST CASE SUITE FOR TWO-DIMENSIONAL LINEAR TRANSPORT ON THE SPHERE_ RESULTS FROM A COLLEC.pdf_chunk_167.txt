likely orders of magnitude below the numerical truncation
errors (numerical diffusion and dispersion errors) introduced
by the scheme itself. For fully Lagrangian schemes based
on parcels, this test forces modelers to deÔ¨Åne areas associ-
ated with the Lagrangian parcels. Cell-integrated Lagrangian
schemes that track cells throughout the integration can test
how well the scheme preserves areas.
As explained in LSPT2012, a highly diffusive scheme
