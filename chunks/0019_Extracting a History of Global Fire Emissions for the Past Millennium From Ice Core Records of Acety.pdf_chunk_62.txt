A similar approach was used to evaluate emission scenarios of methane calculated using the one‐box model.
Emissions of methane from biomass burning, microbial, and geologic sources were varied over a broad
range. The resulting methane and δ13CH4 from each emission scenario were compared to ice core records
of CH4 and δ13CH4 (Table S2). Emission scenarios were evaluated for deﬁned time periods by using the fol-
lowing metrics:
