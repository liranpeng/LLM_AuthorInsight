We divide the atmosphere into distinct spheres based on their physical, chemical, and dynamical traits. In deriving chemical budgets and climate trends, which differ across spheres, we need clearly defined boundaries. Our primary spheres are the troposphere and stratosphere (∼99.9% by mass), and the boundary between them is the tropopause. Every global climate‐weather model has one or more methods to calculate the lapse rate tropopause, but these involve subjective choices and are known to fail
