cloud deck; this difference is much less with high cirrus clouds. The relative differences between 9 bins and 
66 infrared bands (i.e., 5%–25%) should remain. Cloud heating errors at this level are likely to affect the 
lifetime and stability of clouds (Wood, 2012). Overall these results are similar to LZL's liquid clouds and 
confirm that ice clouds also need to be corrected.
In terms of our climate metrics (e.g., global zonal-mean heating rates for January in Figure 1b), SJ/noIR
