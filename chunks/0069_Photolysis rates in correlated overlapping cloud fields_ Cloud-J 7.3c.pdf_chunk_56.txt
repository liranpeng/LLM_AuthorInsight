5 % with mean biases in the boundary layer on the order of
±1 %. The new AvQCA method has smaller rms errors, but
the original MdQCA method has a slightly better proﬁle for
the mean error. Ran-3 is computationally comparable to the
QCAs; it has a reasonable mean bias as expected given the
number of samples (3 × 640), but a much worse rms error,
typically > 10 %.
