do provide a valid chemistry metric for global models with
1◦resolution. It also presents some examples where ATom
measurements and modeling can test the chemical relation-
ships and may address the cause of differences in the O3 and
CH4 budgets currently seen across the models. With this pa-
per we release the full ATom MDS-2 from all four deploy-
ments, along with the updated RDS∗reactivities from the
UCI model.
