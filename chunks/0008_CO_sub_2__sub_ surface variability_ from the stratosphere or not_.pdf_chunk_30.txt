following settings: bandpass frequency (yr−1) range [0.20
0.80]; bandpass applied forward and backward is aver-
aged; ImpulseResponse = iir; Steepness = 0.85. A wider ﬁl-
ter, e.g., [0.16 0.95], produced similar results for the mid-
dle years but large swings for the beginning and end years.
IAV signals derived from frequency ﬁltering for the last 2–
3 years of the record are not robust. The resulting bandpass
IAV (thick black line in Fig. 1c) clearly shows the patterns
