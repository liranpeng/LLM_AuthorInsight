To understand the processes by which O3 and PM in surface
air are inﬂuenced by changes in climate, several approaches
are used (as reviewed by Jacob and Winner7):
(1) Sensitivity studies in which individual meteorological
parameters are perturbed (e.g., ref. 207 and 208);
(2) Statistical downscaling of future changes in meteoro-
logical ﬁelds, using correlations between observed changes in
air quality indices and meteorological variables from climate
