each of these transport modes. In the right column, solid white contour lines show the percentage change relative to the BASE simulation
while the dashed black line indicates the tropopause. Note that different scales have been used for each of the trafﬁc sectors and that the
scales have been reversed in order to show O3 reductions, arising from a 5 % decrease in emissions, as positive numbers.
