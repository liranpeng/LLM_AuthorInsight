the same emissions ﬁles as used in GFDL (OsloCTM-emi) in the
control run, but with a smaller perturbation (14 Tg yr−1) in
the perturbed run. The emission-driven runs are also a test on the
location of the perturbation, as anthropogenic emissions are
perturbed with most of the emissions occurring in the NH,
compared to the surface hydrogen concentration perturbation,
which means that a lower radiative forcing is expected since the
lifetime of hydrogen is shorter in the NH. We have tested the
