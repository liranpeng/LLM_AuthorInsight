is accounted for in IDW, the advantages of using Kriging are
slight. In addition, the covariance function required for Krig-
ing can easily be modeled incorrectly, especially at short sep-
aration distances (Diem, 2003), when many sites are close in
geographic space but their reported values differ by a large
amount, as in the case of air pollution. Many of the geograph-
ically clustered sites in our data sets are located in urban ar-
