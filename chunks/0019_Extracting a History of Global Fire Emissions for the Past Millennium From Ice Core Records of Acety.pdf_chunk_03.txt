terms of (1) temporal trends in global ﬁre emissions and (2) quantitative estimates for changes in global
burning (dry matter burned per year). Three‐dimensional transport and box models were used to construct
emissions scenarios for the trace gases consistent with each ice core record. Burning histories were
inferred from trace gas emissions by accounting for biome‐speciﬁc emission factors for each trace gas. The
