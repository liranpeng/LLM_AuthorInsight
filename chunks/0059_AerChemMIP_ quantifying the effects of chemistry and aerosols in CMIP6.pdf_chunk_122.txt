torical ERF simulations.
The control simulation for these experiments will use 1850
concentrations of WMGHGs and emissions of NTCFs, run
for 30 years in atmosphere-only mode with SSTs and sea ice
prescribed as a (monthly varying) climatology taken from
30 years of the pre-industrial control (experiment piClim-
control; see Table 6) following the Radiative Forcing Model
Intercomparison Project (RFMIP) speciÔ¨Åcation (Pincus et
al., 2016). Provided this experiment is run with the same in-
