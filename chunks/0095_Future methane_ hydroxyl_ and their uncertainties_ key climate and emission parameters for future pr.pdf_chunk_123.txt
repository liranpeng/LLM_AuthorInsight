out the 21st century. Statistical uncertainties in methane
predictions are 8 % in 2100, based on the assessed pro-
cesses in the parametric model. Neglected processes – in-
cluding shifting emission locations, biogenic VOC emis-
sions, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and cloud, dust
and aerosol interactions with photolysis and chemistry –
might cause additional systematic prediction errors, but we
have found that including these processes in one model
