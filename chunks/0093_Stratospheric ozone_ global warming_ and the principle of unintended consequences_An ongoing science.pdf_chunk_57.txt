Atmospheric

models
have
ranged from simple one-dimensional representations to three-
dimensional (3D), spatially and temporally resolved calculations
of the atmosphereâ€™s general circulation. The 3D model now
includes detailed earth system components (e.g., the oceans and
the pedosphere). The calculations involve 105 or more projections
per single 100-year run with spatial resolution >100 km2, using
~10 atmospheric layers and 2 oceanic layers. Detailed evaluation
