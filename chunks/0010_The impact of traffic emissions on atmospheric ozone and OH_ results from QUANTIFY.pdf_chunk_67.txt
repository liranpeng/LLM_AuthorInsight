simulation and the dashed line indicates the tropopause.
However, both methods try to identify the individual con-
tributions from sectors. Changes in the contributions are de-
tected comparably by both approaches (Grewe, 2004), i.e.
the standard deviation based on interannual variability is sim-
ilar for both approaches.
