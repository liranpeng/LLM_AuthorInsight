to as HOMME (High-Order Methods Modeling Environ-
ment). HOMME is a dynamical core framework that cur-
rently accommodates spectral element (Thomas and Loft,
2005; Dennis et al., 2005), discontinuous Galerkin meth-
ods (Nair, 2005; Nair et al., 2009), and ﬁnite-volume meth-
ods (Erath et al., 2012) on conforming quadrilateral grids
on a sphere. A gnomonic cubed-sphere grid deﬁnes the el-
ements, and each element is populated with Gauss–Lobatto–
