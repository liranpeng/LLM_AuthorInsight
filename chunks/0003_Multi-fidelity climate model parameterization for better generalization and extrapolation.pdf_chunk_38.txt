MF-RPN model detailed above without any further training.
Indeed, the low-fidelity network within the MF-RPN model
(red network in figure 1) already provides predictions for the
convection parameterization outputs. Hence we can also test
this LF-RPN model on high-fidelity data points by consider-
ing the corresponding parameterization inputs. The LF-RPN
can be seen as a control model whose performance allows
assessing whether the MF-RPN model is capable of properly
