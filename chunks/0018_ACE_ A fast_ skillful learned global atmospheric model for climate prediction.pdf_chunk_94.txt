are weighting it more strongly, a large (about 50%) decrease in 1-step RMSE is seen for ps. We
also see a large improvement for 5-day RMSE, and smaller improvement for time-mean RMSE of
ps. Notably, even though the USWRFtoa variable is weighted less heavily in the loss function (see
Figure 12) its 5-day RMSE is substantially improved with residual scaling. We believe this is because
the improved autoregressive performance of ps leads to more accurate predictions for other variables
also.
