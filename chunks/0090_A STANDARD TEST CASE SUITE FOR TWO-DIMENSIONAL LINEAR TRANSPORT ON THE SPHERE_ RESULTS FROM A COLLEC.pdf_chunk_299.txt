cle arcs results in 20N 2 spherical triangles. To construct the
dual grid of the spherical triangular grid, we connect the cen-
troids of the triangles with great circle arcs. The resulting
dual grid consists of spherical hexagons except 12 pentagons
corresponding to the 12 starting points of the spherical icosa-
hedron. The total number of grid cells for resolution N is
NR = 10N 2 + 2. For the resulting dual grid, the centroids
of grid cells do not coincide with the vertices of the spherical
