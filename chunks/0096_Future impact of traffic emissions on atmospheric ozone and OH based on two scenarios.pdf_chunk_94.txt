impact of ROAD emissions on ozone RF is expected to de-
cline rapidly in the future and yield values in the range from
1.6 (± 0.91) to 6.5 (± 2.1) mW m−2 in 2050 (Fig. 5, top).
The decreased impact of ROAD in 2050 compared to 2000 is
a consequence of the assumed reduction of NOx emissions,
and is also consistent with the results of Skeie et al. (2009).
When also taking into account the CH4 RF and CH4-
induced O3 RF, the net impact of positive and negative RF
