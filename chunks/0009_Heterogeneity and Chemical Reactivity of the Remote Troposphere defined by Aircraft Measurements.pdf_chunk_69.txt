Matrices are symmetric. Calculated with the 31 376 MDS-0 unweighted parcels using the
standard RDS protocol. F0AM lacks 5510 of these parcels because there are no reported
J values. UCI shows RMSD between years 2016 (default) and 1997 as the value in
parentheses on diagonal. The unweighted mean R values from three core models (GC,
GMI, UCI) are P-O3 = 1.97, L-O3 = 1.50 and L-CH4 = 0.66; all are in units of ppb/d.
