from a single model, the stratospheric chemistry mechanism
in Oslo CTM3 is able to reproduce recent stratospheric ozone
variability (Isaksen et al., 2012).
Ozone generally has greater radiative forcing efﬁciency
in the troposphere than in the stratosphere (Forster and
Shine, 1997), so tropospheric ozone changes tend to domi-
nate the ozone RF components. In our 3 models, the methane
RF through tropospheric ozone is 30–50 % of the direct
methane RF. After including stratospheric changes, ozone
