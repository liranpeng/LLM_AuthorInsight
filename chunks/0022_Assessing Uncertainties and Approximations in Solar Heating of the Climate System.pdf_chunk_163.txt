+4 W m−2 more reflected sunlight than MAX-RAN, as expected because EXP-RAN has greater global cloud 
cover. Similarly, our calculation (using binary clouds) shows MAX-COR has +1.4 W m−2 more reflection 
and similar reduction in surface heating versus MAX-RAN (T1/R19). This reduced effect is understandable
