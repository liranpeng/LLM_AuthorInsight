climates. We first encode our dataset into a latent space and cluster the encoded data using K-means. The fraction 
of data assigned to each cluster represents the prevalence of each convective regime in the dataset. We can use 
these “cluster assignment” vectors to identify the spatial pattern of each type of convection across the tropics. By 
comparing these normalized probabilities between the control and warmed climates, we can objectively quantify
