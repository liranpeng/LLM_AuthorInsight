B. SiË‡c et al.: Aerosol data assimilation in the CTM MOCAGE
and chemistry has led to a large diversity of parametrizations
which with other uncertainties (e.g. dynamics, emissions,
initial conditions) produce large differences in the aerosol
model results (Mahowald et al., 2003; Kinne et al., 2006;
Textor et al., 2006; Shindell et al., 2013).
