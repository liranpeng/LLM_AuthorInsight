emits mainly in the relatively pristine tropical and subtropi-
cal oceans, while the impact of ROAD on methane lifetime
changes is much lower since these emissions take place at
higher latitudes and they can be rapidly transported aloft
over the continents. Additionally, ROAD emissions have a
much higher CO to NOx ratio and are also more affected
by other anthropogenic pollution sources. Considering the
much lower NOx emissions from AIR compared to ROAD
