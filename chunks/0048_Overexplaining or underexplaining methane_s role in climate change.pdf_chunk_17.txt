decay rate as atmospheric MCF over 15 y. If emissions decayed
more slowly, then they would produce a very large negative
signal at the end of the record (and this may explain the 2012–
2015 record); if more quickly, then they would have little influ-
ence on the decay rate after 2000. The proposal that the residual
emissions from the phased-out industrial production of MCF
would follow the chemically driven decay rate over 3 e-folds
to an accuracy of ±4% may be correct, but it is certainly in
