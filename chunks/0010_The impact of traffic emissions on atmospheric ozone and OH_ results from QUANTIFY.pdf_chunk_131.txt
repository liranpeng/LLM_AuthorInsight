OH in the same region is reaching 1.3·104 molecules/cm3.
Note that aircraft emissions have the maximum impact on
OH over the subtropical Atlantic south of the main North At-
lantic ﬂight corridor. Larger humidity values and the smaller
solar zenith angles at lower latitudes during that time of the
year are more favourable for OH production than further
north. Notice that ship emissions also signiﬁcantly contribute
to the OH perturbation in the middle to upper troposphere of
