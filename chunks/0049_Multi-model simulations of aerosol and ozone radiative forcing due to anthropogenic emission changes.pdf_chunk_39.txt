lute AOD) over Europe and maximum increase is 0.25 over
eastern Asia.
Five models simulated surface ozone changes based on
the prescribed emissions of precursors, including methane.
The resulting annual mean surface ozone change (absolute,
in ppb) from 1990 to 2015 is shown in Fig. S2. The pat-
tern of ozone change is similar among the models, but with
some differences in magnitude. The regional changes in sur-
face ozone have many similarities with the surface PM2.5
