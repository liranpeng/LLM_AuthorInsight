ingly establish the role of OH changes in methane trends and then
identify causes so that future OH levels can be projected along
climate scenarios. We posit that the methodology used here—
that of Bayesian inverse box-modeling of an underdetermined
system driven by prior assumptions—needs to be pushed closer
to the real world and to the climate changes or human actions that
alter methane emissions and OH levels. For instance, a specific
