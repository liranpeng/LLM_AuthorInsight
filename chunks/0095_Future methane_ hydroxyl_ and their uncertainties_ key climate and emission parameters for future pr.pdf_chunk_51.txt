observed decay rate swings during 2002–2004. Meanwhile,
total anthropogenic and ocean emissions for those years are
estimated to be 6 and 4 Gg yr−1, respectively, and decreasing
smoothly (Wennberg et al., 2004; Prinn et al., 2005; Montzka
et al., 2011). Therefore, abrupt emission changes might ex-
plain part, perhaps half, of the decay anomalies, but cannot
account for the full discrepancy between simulated τCH4×OH
and observations.
