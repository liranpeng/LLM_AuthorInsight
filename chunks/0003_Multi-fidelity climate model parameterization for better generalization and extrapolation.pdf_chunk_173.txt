of predictions from which we infer the mean ˆy(x) for each of the output variables. The mean is used to estimate the different
error metrics discussed above. We can also estimate the corresponding standard deviation σM(x) which serves as an uncertainty
quantification. We use the subscript M to emphasize that we consider the model’s inherent uncertainty that is estimated for each
