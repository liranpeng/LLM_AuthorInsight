differ by 50 % or more across the models. These differences
are understandable, however, as consequences of modeling
assumptions. For ship NOx, Oslo CTM3 and UCI CTM are
nearly 3 times more sensitive than GEOS-Chem. In the UCI
CTM and Oslo CTM3, ship NOx is emitted as NO, diluted
into the grid volume, and the subsequent production of O3
and HNO3 are calculated by the grid-resolved chemistry. In-
stantaneous dilution overestimates the NOx lifetime and O3
