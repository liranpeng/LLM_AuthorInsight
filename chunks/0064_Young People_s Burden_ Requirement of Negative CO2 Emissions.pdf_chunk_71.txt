Earth has partially warmed in response. Earth’s energy im-
balance is the portion of the forcing that has not yet been
responded to. This imbalance thus deﬁnes additional global
warming that will occur without further change in forcings.
Earth’s energy imbalance can be measured by monitoring
ocean subsurface temperatures, because almost all excess en-
ergy coming into the planet goes into the ocean (von Schuck-
mann et al., 2016). Most of the ocean’s heat content change
