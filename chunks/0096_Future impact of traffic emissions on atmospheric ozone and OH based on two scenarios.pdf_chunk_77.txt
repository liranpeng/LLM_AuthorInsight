are given in Sect. 4.
Table 4 also gives the radiative forcings due to changes
in CH4 and subsequent changes in O3 (long-term effect).
Normally, emissions of NOx from the transport sectors lead
to increased OH concentrations and thereby reductions of
CH4 lifetime and concentrations. The second CH4 RF term is
known as the primary mode and represents the negative long-
term effect of the methane perturbation on O3 (e.g. Wild and
Prather, 2000; Wild et al., 2001). The method of calculating
