mean ozone ﬂux based on proxy relationships with other
trace gases, and this approach gives us a broad range of
400–600 Tg O3 yr−1 (Murphy and Fahey, 1994; McLinden et
al., 2000; Olsen et al., 2001, 2004; Hsu et al., 2005). Unfor-
tunately, using satellite data to resolve the STE ozone ﬂux is
difﬁcult. For example, Hsu et al. (2005) identiﬁed a large ap-
parently isolated column ozone anomaly (1.7 Tg O3) as seen
by satellite during an STE event in the eastern Paciﬁc; the
