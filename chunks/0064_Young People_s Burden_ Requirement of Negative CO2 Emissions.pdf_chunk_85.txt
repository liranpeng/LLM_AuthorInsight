timescales of tens and hundreds of thousands of years, with
atmospheric CO2 amount and the size of ice sheets (and
thus sea level) changing almost synchronously on these
timescales (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013). It is readily ap-
parent that these climate cycles are due to small changes in
Earthâ€™s orbit and the tilt of its spin axis, which alter the geo-
graphical and seasonal distribution of sunlight striking Earth.
