(very small dashes), while the CO covers less than a decade
(wide dashes). In the ﬁrst row labeled “AIR”, each grid cell
is weighted by its size in moles, and thus the plot shows
petamoles per logarithmic bin. In each subsequent row, the
cells are weighted by the reactivity (L-CH4, L-O3, P-O3) in
moles day−1, plotting thus megamoles per day per bin.
The AIR plots show clear model differences. Models A
and B have much greater frequency of O3 occurrence from
