anistic representation of methane loss from tropospheric OH.
We focus on the tropospheric OH sink because other methane
sinks are smaller and their intrinsic variability has a smaller
impact on the total methane lifetime. The parametric model
includes climate and emission factors that control the interan-
nual variability of methane lifetime in the CTMs. These fac-
tors are likely important on decadal time scales as well. The
parametric model also includes anthropogenic emissions that
