tionally constrained check on reactive species (Olson et al.,
2004, 2012; Apel et al., 2012; Stone et al., 2012), and more
recently these have extended the box model as a transfer stan-
dard across CCMs–CTMs (Nicely et al., 2017) that can inte-
grate reactive chemistry over 24 h. The problem remains that
the 24 h integration requires a global model’s diagnostics for
the diurnal cycle of cloud cover and ozone–aerosol inﬂuence
on photolysis.
We describe a new approach for developing chemical cli-
