Fig. 16. Histogram of normalized error norms (ℓ2, ℓ∞, φmin, φmax in ﬁrst, second, third, and fourth row, respectively) for the divergent
ﬂow ﬁeld test case for the unlimited (“un”) and shape-preserving (“sp”) versions of the schemes, respectively, at 1λ ≈1.5. The ordering is
according to minimal resolution 1λm (see Fig. 3 ﬁrst row). The value “−1” indicates that no data are available. The appended CNs are for
