range than at 20 hPa). Overall the models match the observed
patterns, including the seasonal upward shift of contours in
the winter (60◦S in June and 60◦N in October). This test
emphasizes the region where photochemistry is active (sun-
lit latitudes) and ozone is in a quasi-steady state and little
inﬂuenced by transport. Since both UCI and EAM are using
the same chemistry module, they should give nearly identical
results in this test. The chemistry depends somewhat on tem-
