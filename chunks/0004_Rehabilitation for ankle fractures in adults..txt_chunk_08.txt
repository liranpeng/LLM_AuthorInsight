We included 53 studies (45 RCTs, 8 quasi-RCTs) with 4489 adults with ankle fracture.

Here, we summarise the findings for three common rehabilitation comparisons; these included the most data and were the most clinically relevant. Because of different intervention approaches, we sometimes included a study in more than one comparison. Data
