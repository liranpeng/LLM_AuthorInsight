ferred from the average of measurements over longer peri-
ods (i.e., as shown by the Saildrone data, orange lines) and is
characteristic of the SWIFT data away from the local feature
in surface temperatures (e.g., green solid line in Fig. 17).
In the Boulevard des Tourbillons (Region C), coordinated
sampling between Saildrones and two research vessels aimed
to quantify mesoscale and submesoscale airâ€“sea interaction.
Submesoscale variability and strong near-surface currents,
