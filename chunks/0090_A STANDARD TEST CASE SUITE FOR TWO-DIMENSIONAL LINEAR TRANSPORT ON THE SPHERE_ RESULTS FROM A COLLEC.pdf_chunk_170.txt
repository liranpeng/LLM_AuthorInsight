t = T/2) using the cosine bell initial condition for the unlim-
ited and (if applicable) limited/ﬁltered schemes at resolutions
1.5◦and 0.75◦. Results for ℓf at the “minimal” resolution
1λm are not shown although requested in LSPT2012. As
for the convergence plots, data have been arranged according
to discretization grid. We also show a “minimal-τ” ﬁlament
preservation diagnostics as histograms in Fig. 6. That is, the
y axis on the histogram is the τ value for which ℓf is 80; this
