Table 5. List of future prescribed SST simulations. Experiments cover the period 2015 to 2055. The “AER” sufﬁx means models should at
least calculate tropospheric aerosols driven by emission ﬂuxes. The “CHEMT sufﬁx means that at least interactive tropospheric chemistry
is required. Models should always be run with the maximum complexity available. The species columns refer to the speciﬁcations for
