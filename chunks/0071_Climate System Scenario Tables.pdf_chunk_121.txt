results (Holmes et al., 2013; Voulgarakis et al., 2013). Projections of CH4 lifetimes are harmonized based on PI (1750) and PD (2010) budgets that include uncertainties in lifetimes and abundances. 
All projected RCP abundances for CH4 and N2O (Tables AII.4.2 to AII.4.3) rescale each of the RCP emissions by a fixed factor equal to the ratio of RCP to AR5 anthropogenic emissions at year 2010
