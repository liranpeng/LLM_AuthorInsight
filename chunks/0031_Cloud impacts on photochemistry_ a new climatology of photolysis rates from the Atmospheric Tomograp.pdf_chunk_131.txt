erage over cloud ﬁelds out to tens of kilometers, and even
if the atmospheric column at the aircraft is clear, neighbor-
ing clouds alter J values. The chemical models are coarse
resolution compared with the CAFS measurements and aver-
age over wider range of cloud ﬁelds, almost eliminating the
occurrence of clear-sky conditions. Even if they calculate a
distribution of J values for the cloud statistics in a column
(like Cloud-J), they combine these to deliver a single av-
