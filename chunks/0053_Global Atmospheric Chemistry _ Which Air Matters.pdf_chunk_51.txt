all of which are simulated in CTM–CCMs.
What key constituents are needed for modeling reactivity?
Models simulate many tens to hundreds of chemical species.
While many are important for calculating the instantaneous
reaction rates, e.g., O(1D), they are not the key species.
Key is deﬁned here as a constituent whose initial value sig-
niﬁcantly affects the 24 h reactivity, whereas other species
can be initialized to any reasonable value and not affect it.
