Taking these limitations into account an agreement between
modeled and observed ozone concentrations better than
generally 20â€“40% cannot be expected. In conclusion it can
be said that, based on the measurement data used here, it is
not possible to rank the models in terms of quality.

Experimental setup
Changes in tropospheric ozone since the 19th century have
been driven mainly by increasing anthropogenic emissions of
NOx, CH4, CO, and NMHCs, while stratospheric ozone de-
