CH4 RF is described in Berntsen et al. (2005) and consists of
ﬁrst multiplying the changes in methane lifetime (presented
in Table 3) with the estimated CH4 concentrations from IPCC
(2001). A feedback factor of 1.4 was used to take into ac-
count the impact of CH4 changes on its own lifetime (IPCC,
2001). Next, linearized CH4 speciﬁc forcings of 0.33 and
0.31 mW m−2 ppbv−1 were applied, assuming background
CH4 mixing ratios of 2114 and 2400 ppbv for 2025 and 2050
