to their objectives. Note that, for consistency, the concentra-
tions of chemically and radiatively active species should be
the same in the radiation and chemistry schemes. Tables 1 to
6 list the minimum model conﬁgurations required for each
experiment. The sufﬁx “CHEMT” or “CHEMS” indicates in-
teractive tropospheric or stratospheric chemistry is the min-
imum needed for these experiments. The sufﬁx “AER” indi-
cates that interactive aerosols are needed. For models without
