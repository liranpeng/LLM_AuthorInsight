A7
Earth’s energy Imbalance
Hansen et al. (2011) inferred an Earth energy imbalance
with the solar cycle effect removed of +0.75 ± 0.25 W m−2,
based on an imbalance of 0.58 W m−2 during the 2005–
2010 solar minimum, based on the analysis of von Schuck-
mann and Le Traon (2011) for heat gain in the up-
per 2 km of the ocean and estimates of small heat gains
by the deep ocean, continents, atmosphere, and net melt-
