4.4 TgN/yr in this study (see Table 1) and also in Fuglestvedt
et al. (2008), but it is unlikely that this alone has caused the
large differences. In addition the emission patterns of both
ship emission data sets are very different. The distribution of
the ship emissions in Eyring et al. (2007) and Stevenson et al.
(2006) is based on the EDGAR3.2 dataset, where the emis-
sions are mainly concentrated on the major shipping routes.
The ship emissions used in QUANTIFY have been gener-
