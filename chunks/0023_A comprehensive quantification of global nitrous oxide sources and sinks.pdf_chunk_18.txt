mum–maximum estimates: 12.2–23.5) Tg N yr−1 and 16.9 (15.9–17.7) Tg N 
yr−1 for bottom-up and top-down approaches, respectively. The global 
calculated atmospheric chemical sink (that is, N2O losses via photolysis 
and reaction with electronically excited atomic oxygen (O(1D)) in the 
troposphere and stratosphere) is 13.5 (12.4–14.6) Tg N yr−1. The imbal-
ance of sources and sinks of N2O derived from the averaged bottom-up 
and top-down estimates is 4.1 Tg N yr−1. This imbalance agrees well
