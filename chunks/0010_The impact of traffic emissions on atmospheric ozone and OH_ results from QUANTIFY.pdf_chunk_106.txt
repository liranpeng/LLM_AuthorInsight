are released at the surface. In the region between the sur-
face and 900 hPa the relative effect of ship emissions clearly
dominates the total perturbations by all trafﬁc emissions in
each summer hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere during
January the perturbations of ship emissions can almost con-
tribute up to 85% of the total ozone perturbation, since ship
emissions are the major source of pollutants south of 40◦S.
In the northern extratropics the effects from ships are most
