et al., 2005; Mischler et al., 2009; Sapart et al., 2012). Inferring emissions
from methane isotopic measurements and methane concentration
requires knowledge of the isotopic end‐member values for each source.
These are known for the modern atmosphere (Schwietzke et al., 2016),
but there may be climate or ecology induced changes in end‐member
values on centennial or millennial time scales (Sowers, 2010). Changes
to the δ13C of atmospheric CO2 due to industrialization has also altered
