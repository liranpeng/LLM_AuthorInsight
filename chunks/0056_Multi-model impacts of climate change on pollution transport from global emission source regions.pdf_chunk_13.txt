Changes in climate may inï¬‚uence many of these tropical
and mid-latitude transport processes, but the impact of these
future changes on chemical composition remains unclear. In
the tropics and subtropics a number of studies have shown
a poleward expansion and weakening of the Hadley cell cir-
culation in response to future increases in greenhouse gases
(GHGs), which is most robust in boreal winter (Vecchi and
