data, we ﬁnd a range similar to earlier studies, from weak
to strongly positive total aerosol forcing (Kuhn et al., 2014),
but that differs from the assessment of IPCC AR5, which
had a negative total aerosol effect. Here, all models show a
positive total aerosol forcing with a model mean of around
+0.1 W m−2 (0.10 ± 0.08 W m−2 with the uncertainty given
as 1 standard deviation) for the 1990–2015 period. The semi-
direct effect of BC and absorbing organic aerosol (OA) is in-
