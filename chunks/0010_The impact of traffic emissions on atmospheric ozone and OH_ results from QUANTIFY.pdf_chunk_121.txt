turbations as further explained below. However, in particular
during northern summer road transport seems to be most im-
portant for the lower troposphere in the extratropics up to
500 hPa.
The horizontal distribution (Fig. 10) reveals that the
effect on a regional basis can be much stronger than
5·103 molecules/cm3. The largest impact is found in the in-
dustrialized regions of the Eastern US, central Europe and
East Asia reaching 2.5·104 molecules/cm3. In these regions
