over a large area. A second NOx source from ship emissions
covering a large area is trafﬁc along the east coast of Asia.
Besides the continental eastern US and western Europe the
largest emissions from air trafﬁc also occur over the North
Atlantic, though further north than the shipping maxima. In
the southern hemisphere NOx emissions are largely domi-
nated by non-trafﬁc sources and biomass burning.
