hensive. Peters et al. (2013) also note that a continuous shift
from coal to natural gas led to sustained reductions of 1–
2 % yr−1 in the UK in the 1970s and in the 2000s, 2 % yr−1
in Denmark in 1990–2000s, and 1.4 % yr−1 in the USA since
2005. Furthermore, these examples were not aided by the
economy-wide effect of a rising carbon fee or tax (Hsu, 2011;
Ackerman and Stanton, 2012; Hansen, 2014), which encour-
ages energy efﬁciency and carbon-free energies.
