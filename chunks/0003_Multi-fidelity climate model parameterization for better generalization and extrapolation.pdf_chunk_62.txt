lem of importance for machine-learning-based models, and
for the emulation of physical models in particular. In this
work, we showed how the proposed multifidelity (here with
an RPN) approach can tackle this problem by considering the
high-fidelity convection data on historical observations and
optimally merging it with a prior coming from a physically
based parameterization exploring more diverse regimes as it
is computationally cheaper. We showed that the proposed
