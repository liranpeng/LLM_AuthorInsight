Figure S5. This figure complements Figure 4 and shows the annual cycle of N2O/N2OX/F11X at all 
latitudes in each dataset. N2OX simulations are in the two top panels and middle left, while the NOAA 
ESRL observations are in the middle right, and F11X simulations are shown in the bottom two panels. 
Just as in supplementary Figures S3 and S4, all datasets, including F11X, are rescaled to N2OX at 320
