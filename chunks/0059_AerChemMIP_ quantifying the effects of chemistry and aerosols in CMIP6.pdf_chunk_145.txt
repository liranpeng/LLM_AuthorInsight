these, forcing efﬁciencies may be established to be used for
the interpretation of transient simulations.
Characterising the atmospheric forcing in transient sim-
ulations of a fully coupled model poses problems, because
the climate system response alters cloud cover, lapse rates,
and even cryosphere and land surface properties. To ﬁrst or-
der and for most components atmospheric forcing is propor-
tional to the amount of the species perturbing the pristine
