ical UT–LS ozone pattern: ozone decreases from the middle
stratosphere to the lower stratosphere with a sharp gradient
across the tropopause. Figure. 7c shows the ozone hole de-
pletion at 70 hPa over the South Pole in October. Compared
to O3v1, O3v2 simulates less ozone throughout the UT–LS
region except in the lower stratosphere over SH high lati-
tudes. The reduction of O3v2 ozone is consistent with the
lack of high-frequency tropopause variability in the O3v1
