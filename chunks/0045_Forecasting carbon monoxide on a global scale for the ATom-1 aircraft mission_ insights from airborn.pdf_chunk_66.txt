and pressure given in the observations. Both model forecast and
ATom measurements are averaged into a sample rate of one per
360 s. Data in the troposphere are plotted in a circle, while data
in the stratosphere are plotted in a diamond, based on the GEOS-5
tropopause.

CO source contributions
We calculate the contribution of different CO sources to the
total simulated CO using the GEOS-5 tagged CO tracers
sampled along the ATom ï¬‚ight tracks. This analysis pro-
