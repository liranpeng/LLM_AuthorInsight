in low-oxygen zones and their associated variability (see refs. 34,94,95 for 
more detail). Thus, precisely representing the local ocean circulation and 
associated biogeochemical fluxes of these regions could further reduce 
the uncertainty in estimates of global and regional oceanic N2O emissions.
Regardless of the tier approach used, greenhouse-gas inventories 
for agriculture suffer from high uncertainty in the underlying agricul-
