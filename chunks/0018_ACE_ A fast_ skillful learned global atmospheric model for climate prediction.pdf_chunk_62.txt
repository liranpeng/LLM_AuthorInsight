Figure 5: Diagram summarizing the flow of input and output variables. Prognostic variables are
fed back into the model autoregressively. Forcing variables are read from an external dataset and
appended to the prognostic variables at each step. The network outputs diagnostic variables, which
contribute to the loss but are not passed back as inputs for the next step.
