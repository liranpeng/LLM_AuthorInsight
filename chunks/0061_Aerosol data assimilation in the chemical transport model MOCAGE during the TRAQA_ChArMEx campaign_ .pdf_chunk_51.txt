enough information is available to explicitly estimate all cor-
relation members, nor is there enough memory to store them,
the matrix B is modelled as an operator. To estimate the prod-
uct of the matrix B and a vector, MOCAGE-Valentina uses
the integration of a generalized diffusion-type equation in a
reduced space (Weaver and Courtier, 2001).
The observation error covariance deÔ¨Ånes the observation
and representativeness errors. In our study we neglect the
