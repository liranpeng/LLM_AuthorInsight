the 3 CTMs (Table 2, last column).
Table 3 summarizes the data sources for historical climate
and emission variables in the expanded parametric model.
NASA MERRA reanalysis provides temperature and water
vapor data (Bosilovich et al., 2011) and satellite observa-
tions provide ozone column data (Stolarski and Frith, 2006).
As with the 5-parameter model, ozone columns are averaged
over the 40◦S to 40◦N and other data are global averages.
