Figure 5. Steady-state RF (mW m−2) from O3 and CH4 caused
by ship NOx emissions. Values are scaled to emissions of
1 Tg(N) yr−1. Dashed lines link estimates that are made with 5 %
increases in ship NOx (ﬁlled squares) to others made with the same
plume dilution and chemistry assumption (open squares). These
other estimates use CMIP5 emissions, a previous GEOS-Chem
model version, and complete removal of ship NOx emissions. The
