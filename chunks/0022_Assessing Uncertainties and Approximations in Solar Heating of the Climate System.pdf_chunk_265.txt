open IFS cycle 38r1 run at T159N80L60 using the native Gaussian grid for atmospheric 
physics (about 1.1Â° horizontal with 60 layers).  We take the archived 3-hour averages of 
the atmospheric column data: pressure on the layer edges; temperature, water vapor, 
cloud fraction, cloud liquid water content, cloud ice water content in each layer.  A
