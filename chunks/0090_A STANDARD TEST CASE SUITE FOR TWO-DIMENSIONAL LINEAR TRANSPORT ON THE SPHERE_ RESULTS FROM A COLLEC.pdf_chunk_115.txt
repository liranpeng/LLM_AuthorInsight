ulation (t = T /2, where T is the period). Thereafter the de-
formational part of the ﬂow reverses so that the tracer dis-
tributions return to their initial condition at t = T . The de-
formational ﬂow is superimposed on a constant zonal ﬂow
to challenge the schemes further and to guarantee that er-
rors do not cancel when the deformational ﬂow reverses. The
initial conditions are based on distributions ranging from in-
ﬁnitely smooth surfaces to discontinuous slotted cylinders.
