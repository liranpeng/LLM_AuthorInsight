changes (Fig. 2). Surface ozone increases are seen along mar-
itime shipping routes due to increased NOx emissions. Fig-
ures S3 and S4 and Table S1 in the Supplement show the sur-
face changes (ppb decadeâˆ’1) from the models compared to
observations over the USA and Europe. Extensive networks
of surface ozone measurements, using the full 2000 or so air
quality sites in both the USA and Europe, are available from
1993 (USA) and 1997 (Europe) up to the cut-off date of 2013
