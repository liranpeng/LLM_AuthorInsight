is then integrated over 24 h without transport or mixing, with-
out scavenging, and without emissions. Each global model
uses its own varying cloud ﬁelds for the period to calculate
photolysis rates, but the F0AM box model simply takes the
instant J values as measured on the ﬂight and applies a di-
urnal scaling. We initialize with the core species and let the
radicals (OH, HO2, and RO2) come quickly into photochemi-
cal balance. The 24 h integration is not overly sensitive to the
