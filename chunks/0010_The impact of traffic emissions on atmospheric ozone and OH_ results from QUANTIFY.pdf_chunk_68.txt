by 5% is shown in Fig. 3 for January and July, respectively.
Note that the data in Figs. 3 and 4 are scaled to 100% to
allow the comparison to the interannual variability of E39/C
(see below). The column ozone distribution change was inte-
grated from the surface up to 50 hPa. The results from E39/C
are not included in the calculation of the mean Ô¨Åelds since the
results of E39/C were obtained with a different setup and a
different method.
