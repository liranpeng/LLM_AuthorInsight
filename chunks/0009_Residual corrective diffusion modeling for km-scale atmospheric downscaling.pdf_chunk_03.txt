Abstract
State of the art for weather and climate hazard prediction requires
expensive km-scale numerical simulations. Here, a generative
diffusion model is explored for downscaling global inputs to km-
scale, as a cost-effective alternative. The model is trained to predict
2 km data from an operational regional weather model over
Taiwan, conditioned on a 25 km reanalysis. To address the large
