(rms) difference of 0.6 % show that both calculations are es-
sentially identical. Uncertainty in the absolute N2O lifetime
is estimated at Â±8 % (1-sigma), based primarily on the abso-
lute calibration of MLS N2O and the chemical kinetics un-
certainty; see Sect. 4 of P2015.
Uncertainties in trends here are calculated from a linear
regression of the 12-month running averages of the monthly
means as reported or calculated here. We select the 68 % (1-
