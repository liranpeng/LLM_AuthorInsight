As for O3, ROAD will have a reduced impact on atmospheric
OH in the future, and cause a relative change in CH4 lifetime
of only 0.33 % in 2050.

account
changes in O3, CH4 and CH4-induced O3, show that the fu-
ture impact of AIR will increase for all RF terms, but that
the magnitude of change is largely dependent on the emis-
sion scenario with a net RF ranging from −0.54 ± 4.6 (B1
ACARE) to 12 ± 11 mW m−2 (A1B) in 2050. SHIP will also
