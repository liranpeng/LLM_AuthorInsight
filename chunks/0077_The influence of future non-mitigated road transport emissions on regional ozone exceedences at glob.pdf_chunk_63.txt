region, which reduces the transport of O3 rich air into the Medi-
terranean basin. The effect of unmitigated RTE is to increase the
area of exceedences by w6% (Table 2), therefore exerting a signif-
icant effect on regional air quality.
For 2050, the further mitigation of European emissions im-
proves air quality over Turkey, Lebanon and Israel signiÔ¨Åcantly as
the timeline progresses. In part, this is also due to the reduction in
shipping emissions for the region as shown in Fig. 2. The maximal
