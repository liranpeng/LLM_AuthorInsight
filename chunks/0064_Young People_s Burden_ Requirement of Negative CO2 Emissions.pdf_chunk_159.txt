Smith (2016) shows that soil carbon sequestration and soil
amendment with biochar compare favorably with other nega-
tive emission technologies with less impact on land use, wa-
ter use, nutrients, surface albedo, and energy requirements,
but understanding of and literature on biochar are limited
(NAS, 2015a). Smith (2016) estimates that soil carbon se-
