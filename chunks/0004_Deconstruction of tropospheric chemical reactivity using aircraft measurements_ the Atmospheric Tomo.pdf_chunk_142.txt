choose to redo all reactivity calculations with just the ﬁrst
day in each deployment (i.e., days 32, 121, 213, and 274).
Comparisons of reactivities must then be done with the same
single-day calculation with version 2b. Given the range in
reactivities for ATom-1 Paciﬁc and Atlantic, we also did not
redo the sensitivities for MDS-3. Table 4 provides a sum-
mary of the changes in Paciﬁc and Atlantic basin-mean and
median reactivities for ATom-1234 calculated using only the
