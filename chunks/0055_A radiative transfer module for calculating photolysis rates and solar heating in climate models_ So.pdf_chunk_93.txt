RRTMG-SW spectral model. Solar-J minus RRTMG-SW
differences are shown in the right two panels of Fig. 2. As
shown in Fig. 2d, the consistent difference of < 0.1 K day−1
near the surface come from Solar-J’s simpliﬁcation of comb-
ing RRTMG’s 14 sub-bins with O2 and H2O absorption in
bins B24–B25 into the ﬁve sub-bins of S18. In the tropo-
sphere these are small, but in the stratosphere there is a
clear bias with Solar-J producing more heating above 40–
