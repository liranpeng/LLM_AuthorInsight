dicates that heterogeneous chemical reactions are likely not
important in the reactivity statistics here, but a more thor-
ough analysis considering the aerosol composition and real-
istic gammas is needed.

Timescale for O3 perturbations
The sensitivities calculated for the parcels in ATom-1 allow
us to estimate the timescale for an O3 perturbation. Most
modeling studies make the simplistic assumption that the P-
O3 and L-O3 derived from the rates deÔ¨Åned above are the
