the correlation improves from 0.83 for the direct model to
0.96 for the assimilated model run. Each of the two MODIS
instruments overpasses each point once during the daytime
(one at approximately 10:30 and another at ≈13:30 in local
solar time), and this provides sufﬁcient information to even
improve the hourly AOD variation in the assimilated ﬁeld
during different dates (for example, 9–11 July; Fig. 3).
Figure 4 compares AOD from the direct and the assimila-
