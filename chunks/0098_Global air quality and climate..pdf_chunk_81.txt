Air quality response to a warming climate
There are several pathways by which climate change may
inﬂuence O3 and PM air quality. Observational evidence
and model studies of these processes have been reviewed
recently7,13 and are summarized in Table 1. Brieﬂy, the
formation and accumulation of air pollutants is known to
correlate strongly with local meteorological variables (e.g.,
temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and wind). In
