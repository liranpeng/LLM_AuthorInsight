one year (EC, 2008). In this paper we deÔ¨Åne the Exceedence Ratio
(ER) as the near-surface O3 mixing ratios normalized by this EC
standard of 60 ppb. There is typically a strong diurnal cycle present
for tropospheric O3 related to the daily variation in photochemical
activity meaning that the seasonal average could include more than
25 days where the EC recommendations are broken.
