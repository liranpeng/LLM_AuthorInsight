trices at each level at a cost of order 83, while the Feautrier
approach solves the ﬁnite-difference equations with 4×4 ma-
trices at split levels for a cost of order 2×43. As a ﬁrst guess,
the Feautrier code should run 4 times faster than the equiv-
alent DISORT code. We examine the costs and options of
wavelength binning and cloud-ﬁeld approximations below.

Solar-J versus RRMTG-SW
Cloud-J (and hence Fast-J) has been extensively tested in
