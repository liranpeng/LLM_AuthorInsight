absorbing optical depth, τabs, is a very important diagnostic
because in an optically thin cloud the overall heating should
be proportional to it. Table 6 shows that all four ice cloud
models have similar τabs up to S22, and if we average S23
and S24 (which appears to have been done in EC92), then
all four models remain similar in terms of solar absorption.
As noted for the stratus cloud, all models predict a large, fac-
tor of 5, jump in τabs for S25–S27 (λ > 2.5 µm), which are
