MLS, but the new GMI model matches MLS. The GMI chemistry has not changed much, but the P2015 GMI 
was run with MERRA Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 (GEOS-5) circulation, while the current 
GMI uses MERRA-2 circulation. Based on P2015 (their FigureÂ 3), these different loss rates are not caused by 
differences in photochemistry between the GMI simulations, but rather the circulation's ability to maintain
