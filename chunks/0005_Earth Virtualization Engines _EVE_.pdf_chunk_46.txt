injustice. This increases the disruptive potential of climate impacts.
Earth Virtualization Engines (EVE) responds to this new reality.
EVE envisions a world where everyone knows how climate and
climate change affect them and where this knowledge empowers
them to act. By generating entirely new and inherently better
sources of information, EVE strives to catalyze a change in the
broader ecosystem of data and services to deliver a just, equitable,
and scientifically grounded basis for action.
