ture adjustment) was calculated using the University of Oslo
radiative transfer code (e.g. Myhre et al., 2000). The forcing
was calculated using the 3-D monthly mean ozone pertur-
bation ﬁelds generated by each of the participating models.
The annual and global-mean forcings are shown in Table 8.
Averaged over the models, the road and shipping induced
forcings are about the same (27 mWm−2) with aviation con-
tributing around 16 mWm−2. However this hides signiﬁcant
