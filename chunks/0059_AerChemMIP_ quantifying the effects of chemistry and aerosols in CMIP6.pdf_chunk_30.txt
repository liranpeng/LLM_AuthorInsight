al. (2008) highlighted the speciÔ¨Åc impact of the Antarc-
tic ozone hole on regional surface climate by contrasting
CMIP3 models with and without prescribed stratospheric
ozone changes, and by comparing them to online CCMs
from the SPARC Chemistry-Climate Model Validation Ac-
tivity phase 1 (CCMVal-1; Eyring et al., 2007), with follow-
on studies using model simulations from the CCMVal phase
2 (Son et al., 2010; SPARC, 2010; WMO, 2010, 2014).
