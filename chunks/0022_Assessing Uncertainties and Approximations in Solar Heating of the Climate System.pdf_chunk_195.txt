8.	 Multi-stream scattering, level 2. From the experiments here and the careful error analysis of B2015 
and LBYY, it is clear that 2-stream scattering is a major source of error in many codes, including RRT-
MG-SW. 2-Stream RT codes uniformly underestimate atmospheric heating rates by more than 2 W m−2. 
They appear to have bias errors in reflected flux that depend on surface albedo. 2-stream requires some
