DLR E39C, and CHASER in the stratosphere in high south-
ern latitudes.
Local maxima in the deviation are also seen in the tropical
tropopause region, which is largely inï¬‚uenced by convective
processes. Convection, in turn is treated differently by the
models, which contributes to the different behavior of the
models in that region. Also, small shifts in the tropopause
height lead to large relative deviations in the zonal mean dis-
tribution in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere region.
