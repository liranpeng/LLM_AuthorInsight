(vertical) 10 s parcels. With the coarser resolution, we see
a slight shift of points from the ends of the PD to the
middle as expected, but we Ô¨Ånd once again, that the loss
in high-frequency, below-model grid-cell resolution is not
great. Both ATom-derived PDs more closely resemble each
other than any model PD. Thus, current global chemistry
models with resolutions of about 100 km by 400 m should be
able to capture much of the wide range of chemical hetero-
