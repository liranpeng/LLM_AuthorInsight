ing emissions today based on the CTM sensitivities and geographic distribution of ﬁres (Nicewonger
et al., 2018, 2020). In the following discussion, the biomass burning acetylene and ethane emissions are
reported as the sum of the emissions from boreal and non‐boreal regions (see Tables 3 and 4 for breakdown).
Because of the long atmospheric lifetime of methane, differences in sensitivity due to the geographic location
