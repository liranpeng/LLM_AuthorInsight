The geologic outgassing of methane is a subject of current debate. Etiope
and Schwietzke (2019) proposed that such emissions comprise 45
(27–63) Tg CH4 year−1, based on surface measurements from several
hundred global sites. If constant, this would comprise roughly 20% of the
preindustrial methane budget. Ice core Δ14CH4 measurements indicate a
much lower fraction of radiocarbon‐depleted CH4, with best estimates
all less than 20 Tg year−1 (Dyonisius et al., 2020; Hmiel et al., 2020;
