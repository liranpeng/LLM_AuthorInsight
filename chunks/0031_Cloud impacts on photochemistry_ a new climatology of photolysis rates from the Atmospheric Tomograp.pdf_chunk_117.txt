0.10), then bias errors of 2 % to 10 % appear, and the width
of the distribution expands greatly. For SZA = 40–80◦, the
optimum ﬁxed albedo starts showing bias and has a much
broader range of errors under different circumstances (wind,
chlorophyll, SZA). Thus J values calculated using unphysi-
cal, simplistic ﬁxed ocean surface albedos can have errors of
order ±10 % depending on ocean surface conditions and the
angular distribution of direct and scattered light at the sur-
