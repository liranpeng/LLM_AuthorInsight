Curtain plots
The spatial structures and variability of P-O3 as sampled by
the four ATom transects over the Paciﬁc Ocean are presented
as 2D latitude–height curtain plots in Fig. 6. The full sets
of plots covering all four reactivities and also the Atlantic
Ocean are shown sequentially in Figs. 6–13. For these cur-
tain plots, the 10 s reactivities (2 km-by-80 m thick parcels)
are averaged and plotted at 1◦latitude by 200 m thick cells.
