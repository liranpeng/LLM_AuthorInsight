Fig. S2 presents trends in the tropospheric column and sur-
face ozone from the models, showing a much larger differ-
ence between surface and column than for aerosols. Whereas
the forcing efﬁciency of aerosols is strongly dependent on
the surface reﬂectance and their position in relation to clouds
(Haywood and Shine, 1997), the forcing efﬁciency for ozone
is strongly dependent on altitude and is most efﬁcient around
tropopause altitude (Forster and Shine, 1997; Lacis et al.,
