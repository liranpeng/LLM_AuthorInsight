2500 m (Fig. 7; see also Aemisegger et al., 2021). Large-
scale context for the in situ measurements will be provided
by retrievals of atmospheric HDO and H16
2 O from space-
borne instruments.
The size of the network of isotopologue measurements and
the degree of coordination among the different measurement
sites will enable investigations of the variability of the sta-
ble water isotopologues – in space and time, in ocean water,
atmospheric vapor, and precipitation following the trades –
