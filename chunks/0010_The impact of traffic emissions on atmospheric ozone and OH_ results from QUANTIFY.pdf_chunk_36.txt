with 2002 as spin-up. Each participating model calculated
the chemical state of the atmosphere for present day condi-
tions using all emissions as described above. The perturba-
tion simulations were performed by reducing the emission of
each individual transport sector by 5% (see Table 3). This
relatively small reduction was applied to avoid nonlinear re-
sponses of the chemical system which would occur by set-
ting the respective emissions to zero. To check for linearity a
