stochastically downscaling multiple variables simultaneously while
also transferring input information to predict a new field (i.e.,
channel synthesis). If successful, this paves the way towards ML
downscaling systems that produce regional high-resolution weather
as a postprocessing of coarser global predictions. As a proof of
concept we will demonstrate such a ML model trained on high-
resolutionÂ data from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)
