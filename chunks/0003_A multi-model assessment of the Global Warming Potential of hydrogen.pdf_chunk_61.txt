reduction measures, or life cycle analysis. The potential beneﬁt of
switching to a hydrogen economy will depend on hydrogen
leakage rates and potential reductions in CO2 emissions and co-
emitted species. Various assumptions and estimates of hydrogen
leakages vary from 1–10% depending on how hydrogen is being
produced, transported, and stored22,38–40. The little data that
exists on hydrogen leakages comes from assessments and simu-
