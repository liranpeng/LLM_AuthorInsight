uncovers differences among storm-resolving models” of our results section. By only using the cluster centroids 
to get label assignments in other latent representations and not moving the cluster centroids themselves once 
they have been optimized on the original test dataset, we can objectively contrast cluster differences through 
the lens of the common latent space. Using this approach, we create interpretable regimes of convection across 
nine different GSRMs, as shown in Fig. 3d–l.
