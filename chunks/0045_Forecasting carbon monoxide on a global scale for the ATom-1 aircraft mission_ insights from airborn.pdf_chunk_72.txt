ularly from Africa, over the tropics. The contribution from
African BB is strong throughout the troposphere but is partic-
ularly pronounced in the lower troposphere, where it exceeds
100 ppb in the bins centered at 10◦S and 5◦N.
We also examine the tagged tracer contributions for each
ﬂight, including all altitudes sampled by the ﬂight (Fig. 7, Ta-
ble S1). Flights occurring in the tropics and Southern Hemi-
sphere (ﬂights 1, 4–8) receive 44–75 % of the total CO from
