lightly precipitating clouds, aerosol injection accelerates the SCT by enhancing cloud thinning through warming driven by increased entrainment (“deepening–warming” mechanism). For heavily precipitating clouds, where the SCT is dominated by drizzle-depletion feedback, aerosol injection delays the SCT marginally as intensified subsidence amplifies the deepening–warming mechanism. These findings suggest that ignoring large-scale circulation adjustments in limited-domain models may overestimate
