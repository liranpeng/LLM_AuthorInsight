unprecedented detail with which they resolve the global climate. However, it remains difficult to 
quantify objective differences in how GSRMs resolve complex atmospheric formations. This lack 
of comprehensive tools for comparing model similarities is a problem in many disparate fields that 
involve simulation tools for complex data. To address this challenge we develop methods to estimate 
distributional distances based on both nonlinear dimensionality reduction and vector quantization.
