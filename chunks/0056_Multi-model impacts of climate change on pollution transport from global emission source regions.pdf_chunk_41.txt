rological Organization (WMO) lapse rate deﬁnition as im-
plemented by Reichler et al. (2003) for gridded reanalysis
data. The tropopause is deﬁned separately as an average for
the 2000s and the 2090s as the lowest model level at which
the lapse rate decreases to 2 ◦C km−1, provided that the av-
erage lapse rate between this level and higher levels does
not exceed this. Studies have shown the lapse rate or ther-
mal tropopause approximately coincides with the e90 tracer
