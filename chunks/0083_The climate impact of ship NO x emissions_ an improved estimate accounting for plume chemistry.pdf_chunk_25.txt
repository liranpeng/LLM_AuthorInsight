els poorly simulate the Ô¨Årst several minutes of plume ag-
ing, when turbulent transport limits the rates of fast NOx-
O3 chemical reactions (Galmarini et al., 1995; Sykes et al.,
1992), they can provide a good representation of plume com-
position after about ten minutes (several kilometers) of aging,
once turbulent dispersion homogenizes the plume (Galmarini
et al., 1995). Indeed Vinken et al. (2011) demonstrated that
their Gaussian plume model predicts NOx, O3, and OH con-
