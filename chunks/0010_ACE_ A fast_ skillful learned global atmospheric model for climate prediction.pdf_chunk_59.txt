Horizontal regridding
FV3GFS, the model used to generate reference data, uses a cubed sphere
grid [17]. This grid prevents direct use of the SFNO architecture, which in the formulation of [3]
requires data on a latitude-longitude grid. Therefore, we regrid to latitude-longitude using the “fregrid”
tool provided by NOAA GFDL. We use the first-order conservative regridding option. This regridding
