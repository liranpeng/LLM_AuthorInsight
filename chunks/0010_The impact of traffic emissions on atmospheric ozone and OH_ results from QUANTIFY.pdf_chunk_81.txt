As illustrated in Fig. 4 largest uncertainties between the mod-
els are found near the tropopause and during summer when
convection plays an important role in vertical transport in
particular in the northern extratropics. Large emissions by
trafÔ¨Åc take place in that latitude belt and thus have the highest
probability to be redistributed from the surface to higher alti-
tudes via convection during the summer months. The associ-
