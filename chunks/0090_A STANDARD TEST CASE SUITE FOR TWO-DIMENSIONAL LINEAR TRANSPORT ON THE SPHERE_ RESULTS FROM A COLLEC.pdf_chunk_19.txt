scale cascade from near grid scale to the sub-grid scale (Kent
et al., 2012). Similar tests, such as many solid-body revo-
lutions of a large constant plateau spanning many cells, can
be used for “tuning” shape-preserving ﬁlters so that the peak
tracer abundance does not decay linearly (if applicable) de-
spite the initial plateau and analytic solution being very well
resolved (Appendix A16).
It is the purpose of this paper to provide a library of bench-
