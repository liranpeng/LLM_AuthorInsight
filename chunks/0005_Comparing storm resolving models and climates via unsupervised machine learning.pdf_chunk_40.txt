SHIELD, and ARPEGE models is another key finding of our approach. This conformity mirrors what we found 
by inspecting the latent representations (Figs.  3, S5–7), the vertical structure of the leading three convection 
regimes (Fig. S9), and the proportion of each type of convection in the simulation (Fig. S10). It would be worth 
elucidating the degree to which the similarity between these GSRMs is a reflection of DYAMOND GSRMs better
