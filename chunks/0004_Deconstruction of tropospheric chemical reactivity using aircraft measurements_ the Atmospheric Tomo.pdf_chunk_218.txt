most of the model difference is caused by models calculating
different climatologies for the key species such as O3, CO,
H2O, NOx, CH4, and T . When models use the same distri-
bution of key species, they calculate nearly the same reactiv-
ities even though their chemical models have a wide range of
species and complexities.
There remain uncertainties in kinetic rates and cross
sections, yet models tend to use the same values (e.g.,
Burkholder et al., 2020). Using a Ô¨Åxed MDS chemical com-
