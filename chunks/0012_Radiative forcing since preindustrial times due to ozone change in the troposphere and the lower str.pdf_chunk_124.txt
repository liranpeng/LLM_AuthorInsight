precursor, without taking other climate changes into account
(Grewe et al., 2001a). These effects probably lead to the
ozone decrease, which is seen in the lower tropical tropo-
sphere in most models. The increased STE, which also was
identiÔ¨Åed (see Collins et al., 2003; Zeng and Pyle, 2003;
Sudo et al., 2003), may cause the ozone increases seen in the
upper troposphere in the three CCMs with detailed strato-
spheric chemistry. In CHASER this increase is also due to
