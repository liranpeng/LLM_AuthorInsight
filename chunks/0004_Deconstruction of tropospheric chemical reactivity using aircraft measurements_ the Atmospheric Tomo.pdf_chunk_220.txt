100 % for some models that are known to be aberrant in
other diagnostics. Thus, the most important model metric
to develop from the ATom measurements would be stan-
dard probability densities of the key species in those regions
where reactivities are largest: the lower tropics for loss of
O3 and CH4, the upper tropics for production of O3. These
could include co-variation patterns (2D probability densities
in G2023). Sensitivity analysis of the 24 h reactivities pro-
