rlnJ < 0) in the Tropics. Although all the models show this
shift from rlnJ > 0 to rlnJ < 0 in the peak of their distributions,
only a few (GISS, MOCA, NCAR, UCI) have broad wings
of large cloud shielding (rlnJ < −0.1). These models calcu-
late such broad wings for both the Tropics and North Paciﬁc,
whereas CAFS only shows this in the Tropics.
These diagnostics also identify some CAFS anomalies that
have no physical basis in the current models. For example,
