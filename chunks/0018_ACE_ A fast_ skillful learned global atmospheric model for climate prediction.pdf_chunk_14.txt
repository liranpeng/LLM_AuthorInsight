Architecture
We use the SFNO architecture [3] to predict the state of the atmosphere at time t+6hr
using the state at time t as input. SFNO is a Fourier Neural Operator-based architecture which uses
spherical harmonic transforms to enable efficient global convolutions on the sphere, while respecting
inherent symmetries of the spherical domain. Hyperparameters are described in Appendix B; the
