(Meilinger et al., 2005). The recently published update of the
reaction of NO with HO2 (Cariolle et al., 2008) would lead
to a stronger conversion of NOx to HNO3 removing more
aircraft-NOx from the active phase. On the other hand HNO3
acts as a reservoir species particularly in the lower strato-
sphere, which could compensate for this effect. Lightning
NOx is unlikely to have caused the differences since there is
no systematic difference between the 5 TgN/yr in our study
