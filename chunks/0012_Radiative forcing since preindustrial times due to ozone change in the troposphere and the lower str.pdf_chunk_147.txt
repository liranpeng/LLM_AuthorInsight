due to stratospheric ozone change. In general, the models
show many similarities, such as the pronounced negative ra-
diative forcing in high southern latitudes and the rather low,
but positive values in low latitudes.
The global mean net radiative forcings (listed in Table 5)
range from small negative to small positive values. There is
disagreement regarding the sign of the forcing even among
the models with explicit stratospheric chemistry. For those
