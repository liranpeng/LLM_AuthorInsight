MBL structures within trajectories extending westward along the southern periphery of the 
North East Pacific. This Lagrangian approach is designed to minimize uncertainties in the 
large-scale forcing due to horizontal advection in the lower troposphere as air masses move 
from cold to warm SSTs. Thus, the observing strategy was to sample aerosol, cloud, and 
MBL properties in areas upwind from the transition zone over the North East on GV flights
