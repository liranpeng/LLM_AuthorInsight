who stay with us, hold our hands, and, when the
best efforts of modern medicine fail, say that
they will not desert us. People who are sick and
feel hopeless need the very best that medicine,
in its widest sense, can offer. What they do not
need is to be told, "Yes, you are right; death is the
only answer to your problems." That, I suggest, is
the ultimate desertion and the antithesis of hero-
ism.
