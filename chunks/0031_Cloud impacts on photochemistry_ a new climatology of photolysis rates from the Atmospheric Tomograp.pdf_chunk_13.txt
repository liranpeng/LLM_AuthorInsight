3-D world, a sunlit adjacent cloud that is not overhead can
increase J values. It is nigh impossible to specify the 3-D
cloud ﬁelds at ∼1 km scale along the ATom ﬂight paths or
any similar mission: 3-D high-resolution cloud ﬁelds on this
are available, but these are limited to CloudSat–CALIPSO
afternoon overpasses extended to 200 km wide swaths (see
Barker et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2014). Anyway, none of
the standard global models can deal with such a 3-D radia-
