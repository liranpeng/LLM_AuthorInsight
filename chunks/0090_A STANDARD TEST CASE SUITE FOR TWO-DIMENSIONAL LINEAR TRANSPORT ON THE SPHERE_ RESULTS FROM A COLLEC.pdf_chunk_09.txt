parallel compute environments, there has been a signiﬁcant
effort to formulate atmospheric models on more isotropic
grids. Other motivations for alternative tessellations of the
sphere are the design of models with mesh reﬁnement ca-
pability, possibly with smoothly varying transitions between
coarse and ﬁne resolution. This has triggered a renewed inter-
est in developing ﬂuid ﬂow solvers for non-traditional spher-
ical grids. A natural ﬁrst step in model development is to
