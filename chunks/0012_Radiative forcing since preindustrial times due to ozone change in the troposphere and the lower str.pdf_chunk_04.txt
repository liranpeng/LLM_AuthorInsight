of Excellence, ozone changes between 1850 and 2000 are
assessed for the troposphere and the lower stratosphere (up
to 30 km) by a variety of seven chemistry-climate models
and three chemical transport models. The modeled ozone
changes are taken as input for detailed calculations of radia-
tive forcing.
When only changes in chemistry are considered (constant
climate) the modeled global-mean tropospheric ozone col-
umn increase since preindustrial times ranges from 7.9 DU
