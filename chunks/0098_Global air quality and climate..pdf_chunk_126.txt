suggests that over many regions, the range in surface O3
projections is dominated by emission changes. This comparison

Changes in annual mean surface ozone (ppb mole fraction) averaged over selected world regions (shaded land regions) following the RCP
scenarios. Colored lines denote the 4-model average from transient simulations with CMIP5 chemistryâ€“climate models; shading covers the full
