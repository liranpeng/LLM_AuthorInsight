zontal resolution and 31 vertical layers were used for
the simulations.
3. OsloCTM2 (Gauss et al., 2003a; Søvde et al., 2008) was
operated by the University of Oslo and set up with both
tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, T42 horizon-
tal resolution, and 60 vertical layers.
4. The CCM model LMDz-INCA (Hauglustaine et al.,
2004; Folberth et al., 2006) was operated by LSCE with
a horizontal resolution of 3.75◦× 2.5◦and 19 vertical
layers.
