istry. The combination of the new maximum-correlated cloud
groups with the integration over all cloud combinations by
four quadrature atmospheres produces mean J values in an
atmospheric column with root mean square (rms) errors of
4 % or less compared with 10–20 % errors using simpler
approximations. Cloud-J is practical for chemistry–climate
models, requiring only an average of 2.8 Fast-J calls per
atmosphere vs. hundreds of calls with the correlated cloud
