tion of A-train satellite data in numerical models, the COSP
system has been developed that allows simulation of the
signal that CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared
Pathﬁnder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) would see in
a model-generated world. A better understanding of cloud–
aerosol interactions may be possible if models add spe-
ciﬁc diagnostic aerosol calls, which would allow analysis
together with the COSP diagnostic package output. Of par-
