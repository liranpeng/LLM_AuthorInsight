like tracer with surface emissions from Asia held constant,
Lin et al. (2014) examined the mean inﬂuence of Eurasian
pollution over the subtropical North Paciﬁc, inﬂuenced by
the position of the subtropical jet and its decadal variabil-
ity. Under the SRES A2 climate forcing scenario for the
2090s compared to the 2000s, distinct dipole patterns in the
changes in surface CO-tracer mixing ratios were interpreted
as a response to future shifts in regional circulations within
