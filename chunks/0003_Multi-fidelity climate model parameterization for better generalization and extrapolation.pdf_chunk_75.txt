historical run. The testing dataset corresponds to a full year of
the +4K simulation, covering the time period from February
1st 2003 to January 31st 2004, resulting in a final test dataset
of roughly 121.1 M points. The testing dataset is constructed
with a full-year simulation in order to have a comprehensive
analysis of the models performance when tested on unseen
climate scenarios and extrapolated to other phases of the SP-
CAM5 seasonal cycle.
