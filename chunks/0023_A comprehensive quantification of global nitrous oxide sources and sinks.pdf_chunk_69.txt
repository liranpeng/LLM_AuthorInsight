well below the 2 °C target of the Paris Agreement. Failure to include 
N2O within climate mitigation strategies will necessitate even greater 
abatement of CO2 and methane. Although N2O mitigation is difficult 
because nitrogen is the key limiting nutrient in agricultural production, 
this study demonstrates that effective mitigation actions have reduced 
emissions in some regions—such as Europe—through technological 
improvements in industry and improved efficiency of nitrogen use
