with these models or similar CTMs running with assimilated or forecast meteorology is needed, with a focus 
on the SH. Such a study should include correlated trace species (CF2Cl2 as in Nevison et al., 2004, Thomp-
son, Chevallier, et al., 2014, and probably also O3) and also isotopic studies that may be able to separate STE 
fluxes from oceanic emissions (McLinden et al., 2003). Since different N2O isotopes have different sources
