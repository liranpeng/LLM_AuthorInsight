of this emulator stems from key design decisions. By separating the emulation of condensation and precipitation processes, we can better enforce physical priors such as mass conservation and locality of condensation, and the vertical dependence of precipitation falling downward, using specific network architectures. An activity classifier for condensation imitates the discrete‚Äêcontinuous nature of the Fortran microphysics outputs (i.e., tendencies are identically zero where the scheme is
