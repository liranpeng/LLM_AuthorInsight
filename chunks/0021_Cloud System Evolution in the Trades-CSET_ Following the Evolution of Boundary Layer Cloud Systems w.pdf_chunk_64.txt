Atmospheric Profiling System (https://www.eol.ucar.edu/observing_facilities/avaps-
dropsonde-system). In-situ data collected from the sondesâ€™ sensors were transmitted back in 
real time to an onboard aircraft data system via radio link. Input for times and locations of 
the drop releases were sent from the flight scientist on the GV to the CSET home base in 
Sacramento where an operator these would send instructions to the GV to trigger the sonde 
launches at the designated points.
