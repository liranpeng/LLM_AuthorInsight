al., 2012). This allows characterisation of the radiative forc-
ing of the aerosol–radiation interaction and separation of it
from the aerosol–cloud interactions and rapid adjustments.
This is strongly recommended for the reference historical
simulation and ERF time-slice experiments aimed at diag-
nosing aerosol forcing, but is not essential if it is not possible
to implement. Combined with additional RFMIP diagnostics,
this will generate a fairly complete forcing characterisation.
