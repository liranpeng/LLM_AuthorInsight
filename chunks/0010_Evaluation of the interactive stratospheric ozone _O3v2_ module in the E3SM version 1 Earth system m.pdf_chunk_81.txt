prescribed ozone climatology data as described in Sect. 2.1.
The positive O3v2â€“O3v1 change at the SH high latitudes is
caused by more wave activity and meridional transportation
from the middle latitudes to the polar region. The mecha-
nism of this ozone increase is further investigated with the
composite data from years when the O3v2 ozone holes are
substantially weaker with the same PSC temperature thresh-
old as O3v1 (Fig. A2). Strong ozone enhancement occurs at
