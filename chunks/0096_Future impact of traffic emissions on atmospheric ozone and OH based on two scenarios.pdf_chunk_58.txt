be reduced dramatically in the future as a consequence of
the expected decline in O3 precursor emissions for this trans-
port sector. In the PBL zonal mean for NH summer, the O3
impact from ROAD peaks near 40◦N with a value exceed-
ing 3 ppbv in 2000, while the corresponding number is only
0.5 ppbv in 2050 A1B (Fig. 3, bottom left). Due to the more
polluted continental boundary layer, where ROAD emissions
take place, the O3 enhancement efﬁciency for this trafﬁc sec-
