0–100% are used in CCMs and CTMs; this range aﬀects the
sign of the O3 response to changes in BVOC emissions.323–326
Chemical mechanisms that include RONO2 formation without
recycling NOx via subsequent reaction display little biogenic
VOC-ozone-climate sensitivity,8 and mechanisms that ignore
RONO2 altogether show large biogenic VOC-ozone-climate
sensitivity.242 There is additional uncertainty in the RONO2
yield from isoprene oxidation with laboratory yields ranging
