e.g. the Po Valley in Italy (c.f. Fig. 2).
For 2050 (right panels) the increases in ER around the UK and
Paris persist, where the additional titration effect disappears causing
a small increase of <0.5 ppb in near-surface O3 across Scandinavia
and above the seas surrounding NortheWest Europe (not shown).
For the rest of Europe the ER values fall signiﬁcantly by 0.1e0.3
indicating signiﬁcant reductions in the seasonal mixing ratios of
