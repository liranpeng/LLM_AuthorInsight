can drive decadal trends in methane lifetime, but contribute
little to interannual variability. Uncertainties in atmospheric
chemistry are included in the parametric factors based on the
range of perturbation responses across the CTMs. We evalu-
ate the parametric model against 13-yr CTM simulations of
methane lifetime, and against observed variability in tropo-
spheric OH, as measured by the decay of methyl chloroform.
Assuming that the same climate and emission processes will
