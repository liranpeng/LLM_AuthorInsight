the outbound RF10 (27 July 2015) and the inbound RF11 (29 July 2011) flight sequences 
discussed earlier (Fig. 3) are shown in Figs. 7a and 7b. The changes in the boundary layer 
depth with longitude are shown clearly by the HCR and HSRL returns along the outbound 
flight in Fig. 7a where the depth increases from about 0.5 km to 1.2 km from 124째 to 130째 
W. From 130째 to 137 째W the boundary layer depth is nearly constant at a height of about 1.2
