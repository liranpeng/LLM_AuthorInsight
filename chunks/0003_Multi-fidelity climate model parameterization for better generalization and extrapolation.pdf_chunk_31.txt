RPN trained only on the HF data and will be referred to as SF-
HF-RPN. Hyperparameters of individual neural networks did
not need to be tuned from scratch. They were instead chosen
based on the hyperparameter optimization over ∼250 trials
conducted in Mooers et al.’s study on fully-connected neural
network convection superparameterization for SPCAM530
(Methods). RPN ensembles of 128 networks were considered
as justified in Yang et al.68.
