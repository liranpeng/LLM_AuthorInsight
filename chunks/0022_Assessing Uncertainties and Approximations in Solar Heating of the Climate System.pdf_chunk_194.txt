tered light. In terms of reflected light, LBYY show large dipole errors with SZA in reflected flux for δ-Ed-
dington scaling. Fortunately, δ-scaling appears to have little impact on atmospheric heating. There is no 
assessment here because any solution requires multi-stream scattering, a more formidable task.
