global anthropogenic and biomass burning CO sources with
a ﬁrst-order decay lifetime of 50 days (Shindell et al., 2008;
Fang et al., 2011; Doherty et al., 2013). This idealised tracer
is relatively long lived such that it can undergo interhemi-
spheric transport and be used to diagnose how changes in
transport from source regions affect the distributions of trace
gas species with similar lifetimes (such as CO and O3).
Monthly CO-tracer ﬁelds were generated for two 10-year
