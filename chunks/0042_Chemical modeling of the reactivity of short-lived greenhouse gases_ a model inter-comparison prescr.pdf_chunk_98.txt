q, the model showed surprisingly large shifts in L-O3 and L-
CH4 along with standard deviations 2–10 times larger than
the lower limit based on different UCI model years. In fact,
the UCI model using GFDL and NCAR T and q has about
the same rms reactivity differences with respect to the refer-
ence case as do the full models (Compare Tables S8 and 3,
noting that Table 3 is a 5-day mean result and not 1-day re-
sult). Thus, without a model being able to use the speciﬁed
