types. Furthermore, plotting the proportion of each of the three clusters for every spatial coordinate separately 
reveals a distinction of one cluster dominating over land, and two over oceans. We thus find that the three 
dominant clusters represent marine shallow convection (blue), deep convection (red), and continental shallow
