show similar patterns of agreement and disagreement among
models but emphasize the dominant role of the middle tropo-
sphere (500–800 hPa) for O3 loss. P-O3 has distinct patterns,
demonstrating the importance of larger NOx values in the
upper (200–500 hPa) and lower troposphere (800–1000 hPa),
presumably from lightning NOx. Only GMI-CTM lacks
lower troposphere sources of O3 at about 180◦E. Overall
the models show modest, similar amplitudes (but not always
