and as adapted to our last visible band (485-778 nm). In some test cases using alternative 
spectral models LLNL and CLIRAD, we have further reduced this latter band to 485-700 
nm to match the IR bands of these two models.  
 
The solar heating codes Solar-J and RRTMG-SW are included as modules within the UC 
Irvine chemistry-transport model (UCI CTM, Prather et al., 2017).  The UCI CTM is 
coupled with meteorological fields from the European Centre Integrated Forecast System,
