estimates for 2000 by 2050. This reduction in NTS is then subse-
quently offset by the growth in regional shipping emissions
resulting in no net decreases in the number of exceedences over the
timeline. Again, taking differences in the ER ratios between the A1B
and A1B_HIGH simulations reveals that there is an increase in the
exceedence area of w2%, which equates to a larger area than that
for the ME/Turkey due to the size of each respective region.
