wavelength dependence (arbitrary cross sections) for clouds (dashed line) and typical aerosol (dotted). Rayleigh cross 
sections have scaled by 107 to be compared with those of O3, assuming tropospheric abundance of 100 ppb. Clouds have 
no wavelength dependence across this region and aerosols are shown for an Angstrom coefficient of 1. (b) The solar 
spectrum and the wavelength bands used in Solar-J (blue), RRTMG (red) plus the high-resolution-visible version of 
Solar-J/hrv (black dots).
