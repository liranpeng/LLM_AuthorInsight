larly to the proﬁles, the PDs show detectable but insigniﬁcant
changes from v2b to v3 and remain robust (i.e., compared
with Figs. 40–43). For the most part, the mean reactivities
change by < 0.01 ppb d−1, with major exceptions for P-O3 in
Paciﬁc ATom-34 and Atlantic ATom-23, where the v3 value
is 0.03 to 0.10 ppb d−1 smaller than the v2b value. The L-CO
also shows some decreases with v3 of about 0.03 ppb d−1
(Paciﬁc ATom-3, Atlantic ATom-2), and in a relative sense
