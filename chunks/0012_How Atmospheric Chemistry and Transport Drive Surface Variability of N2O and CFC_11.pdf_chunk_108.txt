ended before the anomaly began.
The next question is how these anomalous QBOs are manifested as anomalies in surface abundance (ppb/
yr). For this, we compare the anomalous 2010/11 QBO centered at the 08/2010 QBO phase change (supple-
mentary Figure S4), with the composites of six standard QBO cycles (Figure 3). The NOAA surface pattern 
of this 2010 anomaly is surprisingly different from its composite with a large positive N2O anomaly in the
