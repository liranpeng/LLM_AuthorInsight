els using the historical meteorology and chemical emissions,
because of slight phase errors in the location of large-scale
gradients or laminae (e.g., Reid et al., 1998; Manney et al.,
1998; Wild et al., 2003; Kiley et al., 2003; Allen et al., 2004;
Schoeberl et al., 2007; Elguindi et al., 2010). The other type
of chemistry models, the chemistryâ€“climate models (CCMs),
are our means of understanding future air pollution (Prather
