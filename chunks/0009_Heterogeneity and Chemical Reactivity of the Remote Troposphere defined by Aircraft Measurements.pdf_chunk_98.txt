heterogeneous with greatly reduced spatial extent, likely of
recent convective origin as for the eastern Paciﬁc.
Overall, the extensive ATom proﬁling identiﬁes a hetero-
geneous mix of chemical composition in the tropical Atlantic
and Paciﬁc, with a large range of reactivities. What is impor-
tant for those trying to model tropospheric chemistry is that
the spatial scales of variability seen in Fig. 2 are within the
capability of modern global models.
