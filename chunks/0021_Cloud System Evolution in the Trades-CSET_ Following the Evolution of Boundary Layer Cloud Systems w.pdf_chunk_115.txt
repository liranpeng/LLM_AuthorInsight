11). The precipitation cores of the systems shown in Fig. 11 have a horizontal extent of 
about 5-10 km horizontally. The out-flow areas in these mesoscale systems by the radar are 
about double that of the precipitating cloud areas.
The lidar and radar observations made in this case were taken while the GV was flying 
above the boundary layer. On the edges of the cloud away from the heavily precipitating
