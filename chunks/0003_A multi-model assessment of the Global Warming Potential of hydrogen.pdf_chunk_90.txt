Where ΔBurdenH2 is the burden change between a perturbed and a control run
that have both reached steady state, and τH2 is the lifetime in the control run
multiplied by a feedback factor to account for the shift in hydrogen lifetime
induced by hydrogen changes.
In practice, we use a slightly different, but equivalent expression for the AGWP
to calculate it from the experiments. Including the hydrogen feedback factor in the
