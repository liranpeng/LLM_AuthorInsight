100-per-decade case, those years with more events will more
likely to have bigger episodes, with all else being equal. This
can easily be seen by the CCDFs in Fig. S6 in the Supplement
and the ( ¯S) values in Table 3. Even when each year is forced
to have the same number of events, the CCDFs for each of the
years are not similar (see Fig. S7 in the Supplement). Using
these renormalized AQX episode size distributions, we test if
we can statistically identify “good” and “bad” years (based
