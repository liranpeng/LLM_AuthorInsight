tude of the aerosol cooling leads to large uncertainties in
projections of future climate change (e.g., ref. 93 and 94).
Removal of this cooling inﬂuence due to air pollution abate-
ment policies is expected to enhance future warming.95–98
The strong warming due to the direct eﬀect and snow-
albedo eﬀect of BC imply that BC emission reductions could
yield a short-term climate beneﬁt.99–105 Models indicate that
