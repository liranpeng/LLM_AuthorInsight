This would allow the ﬁrst ever evaluation of the ability of
microphysical models, which depend on a variety of param-
eterized processes, to quantitatively represent precipitation
formation processes in realistically simulated cloud ﬁelds.
Previous attempts (Ackerman et al., 2009; vanZanten et al.,
2011) at making such an evaluation have highlighted large
differences in models, but it remains unclear to what ex-
tent these differences are due to the representation of cloud
