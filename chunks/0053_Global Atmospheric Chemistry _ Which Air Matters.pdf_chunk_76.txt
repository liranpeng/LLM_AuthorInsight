1.0 to 2.5 ppb. The implications for using the A-run bias in
computing the reactivities are examined with all six models
below.
An important assumption in using key species to initial-
ize the reactivity simulations is that the diurnal cycle is not
critical, and ATom measurements can be used without trying
to make corrections for the time of measurement. In running
these global models, it is not practical to initialize parcels
at other than a standard day (i.e., beginning at 00:00 UT).
