zero net RF line accounts for long-lived O3 changes that enhance
the CH4 RF by approximately 34 % (Eq. 4). Literature values are
from studies listed in Tables 2 and 3.
occur over land, however, due to long-range transport of
O3 and H2O2 perturbations from ship NOx. These oxi-
dants mainly convert SO2 to sulfate in cloud water, which
is quickly followed by wet deposition, so that ship NOx
drives sulfate aerosol burdens down over anthropogenic SO2
