decreased by 20% in one of the four source regions (EU,
NA, SA and EA; see Figure 1). For each experiment, the
changes in NOy deposition in each of these regions were
examined. Previous work indicates that NOy deposition
fluxes are principally controlled by the location and mag-
nitude of NOx emissions [Lamarque et al., 2005; Sanderson
et al., 2006]. To check this, results from a second series of
experiments, in which anthropogenic emissions of all pre-
