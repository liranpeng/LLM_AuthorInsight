RCP scenarios (Voulgarakis et al., 2013).
Carbon isotopes provide a valuable constraint (Saunois et
al., 2016) that aids analysis of which CH4 sources16 con-
tribute to the CH4 growth resurgence in the past decade
(Fig. 7). Schaefer et al. (2016) conclude that the growth was
primarily biogenic, thus not fossil fuel, and located outside
the tropics, most likely ruminants and rice agriculture. Such
an increasing biogenic source is consistent with effects of in-
