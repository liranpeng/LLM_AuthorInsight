Up to 87% of this increase results from direct emission from agriculture 
(71%) and indirect emission from anthropogenic nitrogen additions 
into soils (16%). Direct soil emission from fertilizer application is the 
major source of increases in emission from agriculture, followed by 
a small but notable increase in emissions from livestock manure and 
aquaculture. Model-based estimates of direct soil emissions15â€“17 show a
