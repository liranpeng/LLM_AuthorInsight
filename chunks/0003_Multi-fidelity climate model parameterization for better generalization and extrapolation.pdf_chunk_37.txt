the MF-RPN (Methods). Finally, since the low-fidelity train-
ing data was built such that it provides the MF model with
useful information regarding the high-fidelity extrapolation
scenarios, the MF-RPN model is trained on normalized data
with respect to the statistics of the CAM5 +8K run data in
order to take into account the data distribution shift between
different fidelity levels (Methods).
Low-fidelity Randomized Prior Networks
A low-fidelity RPN model can be considered based on the
