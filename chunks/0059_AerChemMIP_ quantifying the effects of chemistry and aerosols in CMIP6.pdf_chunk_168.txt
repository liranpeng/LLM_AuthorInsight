The diagnostics requested represent a subset of the diag-
nostics requested for the AeroCom and CCMI model com-
parison activities. These include 2-D hourly (surface level
ozone, PM2.5, and NO2), 3-D monthly mean concentrations
of aerosol species, ozone and ozone precursors (including
methane, CO, NO2, OH, and VOCs), column data (ozone),
