polluted areas while reducing it in remote areas.
With regard to climate change, ozone affects the radiative
budget of the atmosphere through its interaction with both
shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiation and its chem-
ical inﬂuence on other radiatively active trace gases such as
methane and HCFCs. Radiative forcing is commonly deﬁned
as the imbalance in radiative ﬂux at the tropopause resulting
from a perturbation in the atmosphere, in order to determine
