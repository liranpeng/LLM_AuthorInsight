A minor feature is that cloudy atmospheres cost about 10 %
more than clear atmospheres because Cloud-J inserts extra
layers at the top of clouds to enhance the accuracy of the
ﬁnite-difference equations.
In a series of comparisons on a single-socket multi-
threaded CPU, we ﬁnd that Solar-J takes 5 times more wall
clock time than RRTMG-SW. This is not surprising given
the cost of solving an eight-stream versus two-stream RT
problem. An additional cost of Solar-J (not included above)
