model is run with two different conﬁgurations. In GFDL-emi the model is run with
repeating hydrogen emissions over 50 years using 2010 conditions as described in
Paulot et al.17. In the perturbation experiment the hydrogen anthropogenic
emissions are increased by 200 Tg yr−1 and surface methane concentrations are
increased from 1808 ppbv to 2005 ppbv. In GFDL, the model is run with prescribed
hydrogen and methane as the other models, with horizontal winds nudged to 6hr-
