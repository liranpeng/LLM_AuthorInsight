higher precipitation rates known as the “amount effect.” Here, an efficient and numerically stable quasi‐analytical model simulates the evaporation of raindrops and enrichment of their isotope composition. It is applied to a drop size distribution and subcloud environment representative of Atlantic trade cumulus clouds. Idealized physics experiments artificially zero out selected processes to discern the separate effects on the isotope ratio of raindrops, of exchange with the environment,
