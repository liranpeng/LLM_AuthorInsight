rameterize turbulence32, atmospheric1–4,30,33–35 and oceanic
processes5, these methods struggle with out-of sample testing
inputs and are unable to extrapolate beyond the training data
regimes and scenarios2 (out-of-distribution limitations). An
important body of recent work has made exciting progress on
using machine learning methods to reduce biases in climate
simulations36–39. However, these approaches were restricted
to improving coarse-grid climate and weather models using
