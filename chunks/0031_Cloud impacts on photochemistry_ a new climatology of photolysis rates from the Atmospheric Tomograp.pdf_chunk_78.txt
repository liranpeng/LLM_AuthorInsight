the plot). For the other ﬁve models (Group 2: IFS, MOCA,
NCAR, UCI, UCIb), these clear-sky equivalent Js occur only
10–20 % of the time, with cloud brightening enhancements
occurring at 80–90 %. Surprisingly, both model groups show
the same average magnitude, +10 % (Xs on the right side),
for their enhanced Js. Thus Group 2 models will have sys-
tematically greater J-O1D in the upper tropical Paciﬁc than
the Group 1 models (i.e., the 10 % enhancement occurs twice
