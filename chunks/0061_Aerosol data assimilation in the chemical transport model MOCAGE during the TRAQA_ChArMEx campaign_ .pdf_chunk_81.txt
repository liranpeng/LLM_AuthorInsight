Table 2 shows the statistics corresponding to this ﬁgure. The
two desert dust events in the ﬁgure are highlighted with high
values of AOD (> 0.25). The ﬁrst, stronger dust outbreak in-
creases AOD values during 4 to 5 days over the region (from
27 June to 1 July). Its extent is well simulated in the model
direct run, but its intensity is underestimated (Fig. 2). The as-
similation produced ﬁelds that are closer to the SEVIRI ob-
servations. The second desert dust event occurs at the end of
