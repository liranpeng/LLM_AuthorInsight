rated and a decrease in road trafﬁc emissions lead to larger
ozone production efﬁciency and larger contributions to ozone
from other sectors. Hence, a large decrease in ozone con-
tribution from road trafﬁc is accompanied by an increase in
the ozone concentrations from other sectors leading to only
small changes in the ozone perturbation. For simplicity, the
term “impact” is used throughout this manuscript to describe
the response in O3 and OH of a 5 % decrease in emissions
