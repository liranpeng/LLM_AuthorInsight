observed pattern, highlighting the potential role of the QBO in tropospheric chemistry and composition, 
as well as in model evaluation. The observed annual surface signal in the northern hemisphere matches 
well with the models run without emissions, indicating the annual cycle is driven mostly by stratosphere-
troposphere exchange (STE) flux of N2O-depleted air and not surface N2O emissions. In the southern
