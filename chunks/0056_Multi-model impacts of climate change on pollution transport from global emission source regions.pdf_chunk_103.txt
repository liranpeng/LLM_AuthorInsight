near the tropopause on CO-tracer mixing ratios (Sect. 3.2)
are largely outweighed by the impact of the rise in the
tropopause, although these effects may be interrelated. How-
ever, the tropopause relative proﬁles in the 2090s also show
a slightly weaker vertical gradient between the mid-upper
troposphere in the NH extratropics (40◦N) compared to the
2000s (Fig. 11, top panels). This reduced vertical gradient
has been noted in previous studies and also related to a rise
