360/1λ and the corresponding truncation wave number is
ntrunc = nx/2 −1.
(A9)
Thus, the linear grid is used (rather than the quadratic grid
where ntrunc = nx/3 −1).
For the 1.5◦simulations the truncation wave number is
TL119, and dimensionless time step size is 5/120 and 5/600
for CN = 5.2 and CN = 1.0, respectively. Similarly, for 0.75◦
