calculations, these estimates have been mostly derived from
observed ozone changes.
Chemistry-climate feedback mechanisms have been dis-
cussed in various publications (e.g. Granier and Shine, 1999;
Grewe et al., 2001a; Isaksen et al.
2003; Stevenson et
al., 2005). Major identiÔ¨Åed feedback mechanisms include
the change of chemical reaction rates due to temperature
change, the enhanced photochemical destruction of tropo-
spheric ozone related to increased humidity, changes in light-
