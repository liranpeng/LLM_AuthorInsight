forcers, NTCFs) are estimated to have been responsible for
a climate forcing that is presently nearly equal in magnitude
to that of CO2 (Shindell et al., 2013a; Myhre et al., 2013a).
These emissions are thought to have led to a variety of global
climate impacts including changes in regional patterns of
temperature and precipitation (Rotstayn et al., 2015). In ad-
dition, NTCF forcing is inherently spatially inhomogeneous
(Shindell et al., 2013a), which leads to regional responses,
