using the coarse‐grained temperature, specific humidity, surface turbulent heat fluxes, cosine of solar zenith angle, land‐sea mask and surface geopotential of that grid column as inputs. The coefficient of determination R2 for offline prediction ranges from 0.4 to 0.8 at most vertical levels and latitudes. Online, we achieve stable 35‐day simulations, with metrics of skill such as the time‐mean pattern of near‐surface temperature and precipitation comparable or slightly better than a baseline
