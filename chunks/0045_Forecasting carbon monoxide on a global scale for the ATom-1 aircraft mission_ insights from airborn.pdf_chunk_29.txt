clude day-to-day and interannual variability, but the non-BB
sources and the OH Ô¨Åelds use monthly means and lack daily-
scale variability and interannual variability. Table 1 presents
the August emission inputs for the major regions considered.
CO emissions are then scaled up by 20 % for fossil fuels and
11 % for biomass burning to account for CO production from
co-emitted VOCs, since VOCs are not explicitly carried in
the GEOS-5 FP chemical mechanism. This approach was de-
