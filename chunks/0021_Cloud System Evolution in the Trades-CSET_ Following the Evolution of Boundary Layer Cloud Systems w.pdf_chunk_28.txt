stratocumulus and the trade cumulus regime. Although the cloud transition is well defined in 
some of the transects, the slow movement of the ship limits the usefulness of these 
observations for Lagrangian studies. The long range of the GV uniquely positions it to 
provide in-situ measurements of aerosols and cloud microphysics, including interactions 
with the free troposphere across the entire transition and to track the evolutions of cloud 
systems.
