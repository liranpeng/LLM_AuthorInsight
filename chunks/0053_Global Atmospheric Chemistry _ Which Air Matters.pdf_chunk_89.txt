models without transport have been developed (e.g., neural
networks in Nicely et al., 2017). We choose the A-run ap-
proach as it will allow us to more directly compare modeled
reactivities based on the primary CTMâ€“CCM coding and still
allows for all models to be initialized with the same chemical
composition.
