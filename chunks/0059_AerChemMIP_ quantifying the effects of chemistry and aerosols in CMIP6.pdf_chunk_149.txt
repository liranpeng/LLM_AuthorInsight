the black carbon forcing efÔ¨Åciency.
A source of confusion has been the aerosol optical thick-
ness (AOT) diagnostics (e.g. Flato et al., 2013, Fig. 9.29) in
CMIP models. Natural (particularly dust and sea-salt) and
anthropogenic aerosols have been blended together in differ-
ent ways in models. We request output to diagnose the differ-
ent aerosol species contributions to total AOT, and to provide
more insight into the reasons for differences in AOT between
