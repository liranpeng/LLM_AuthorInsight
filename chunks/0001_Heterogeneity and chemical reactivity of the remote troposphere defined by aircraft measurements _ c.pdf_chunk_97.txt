tremes of reactivity? While the sorted reactivity curves
(Fig. 1, Tables 2 and S8) continue to steepen from the 90th to
97th percentile, the slope does not change that much. Thus
we can estimate the 99th + percentile contributes < 5 % of
the total reactivity. Thus, if our model misses the top 1 % of
reactive air parcels (e.g., due to the inability to simulate in-
tensely reactive thin pollution layers) then we miss at most
5 % of the total reactivity. This ﬁnding is new and encour-
