tion. The ℓf curves, in particular for FARSIGHT-CN10.4,
are oscillatory and non-monotone. The SFF-CSLAM4 and
CAM-FV0.2 schemes have a rather wide range of τ values
(approximately τ ∈[0.6 : 0.8]) for which ℓf exceeds 100.0,
which is likely due to steepening of gradients. In conclusion,
there are indications that this metric is most useful for test-
ing schemes employing “ad hoc” ﬁxers or schemes with anti-
diffusive terms or other mechanisms that may steepen gradi-
