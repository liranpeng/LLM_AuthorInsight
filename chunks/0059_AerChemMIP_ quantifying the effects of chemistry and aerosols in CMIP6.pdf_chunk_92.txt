istry (at least tropospheric). The transient ERF pattern from
these simulations is expected to be relatively homogeneous,
although their chemical effects on ozone and secondary
aerosols may be less so. Therefore, AerChemMIP does not
include any experiments to derive the climate responses to
methane or nitrous oxide forcing. The climate response to
homogeneous forcing is quantiÔ¨Åed in Detection and Attribu-
