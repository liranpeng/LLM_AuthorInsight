magnitudes of acetylene and ethane after industrialization makes estimating the biomass burning source
of these gases into the modern era highly uncertain (Nicewonger et al., 2018, 2020). However, qualitatively,
the ice cores levels of acetylene and ethane do not show any large changes into the mid‚Äê1800s from their
mean level in the 1700s, indicating that the sources, including biomass burning, likely stayed low through
