in-cloud heating than RRTMG(Fu) (their Figures 2d−f). As shown in LBYY, this is a standing problem with 
all 2-stream codes, and the new ice optics appear to have made this error worse.
Baek and Bae (2018) updated the Korean Integrated Model (KIM) radiation code based on RRTMG using 
the Yang et al (2013) ice optics library and tested with the KIM forecasting system. They show that use of
