(220–250–280 K) and weight-percent sulfuric acid (50–70–
90 %) with 220 K and 70 % being typical for the stratosphere
(McGouldrick et al., 2011). The refractive indices and size
distributions of tropospheric aerosols are not as well charac-
terized. Cloud-J has a collection of aerosol optical properties
for wavelengths 300–800 nm based on community contribu-
tions (e.g., Liousse et al., 1996; Martin et al., 2003), and this
has been propagated for testing in Solar-J. However, if heat-
