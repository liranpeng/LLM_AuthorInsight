scattering may contribute. The forward–backward enhance-
ment in Rayleigh scattering is not represented in two-stream
isotropic scattering. Thus, RRTMG – Solar-J differences will
shift as the primary beam shifts from vertical to horizontal as
a much greater fraction of the visible light is scattered. At
low sun, the Rayleigh optical slant path along the solar beam
is much greater than 1 for bin S17 and even ∼1 for S18.
