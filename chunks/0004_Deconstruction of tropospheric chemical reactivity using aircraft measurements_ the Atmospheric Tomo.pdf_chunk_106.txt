Individual parcels show highly variable individual S val-
ues (see the examples in Fig. 48). The scatter is particularly
large because we have included all the ATom-1 parcels, in-
cluding continental data and very low sun angles. For com-
parison, the basin-mean values (large blue and red dots) are
also plotted. Differences across basins and deployments are
modest (not shown), and the Paciﬁc–Atlantic comparison for
ATom-1 covers this range, remembering that ATom-1 Paciﬁc
