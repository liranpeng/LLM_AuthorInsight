the two systems is characterized by precipitation shafts with relatively high radar reflectivity 
and downward motions of about 4 msâˆ’1. Cleary defined outflow areas extend from these 
cores near cloud top. Although the cloud tops in the cores are at a height of about 2 km, the 
precipitation from these areas can be relatively heavy and of sufficient intensity to give 
rainbows that were observed from the GV when flying at low levels (example shown in Fig.
