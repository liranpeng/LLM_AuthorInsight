creases dramatically as the magnitude of warming increases.
Hansen et al. (2016), based on a combination of climate mod-
eling, paleo-data, and modern observations, conclude that
continued high GHG emissions would likely cause multi-
meter sea level rise within 50â€“150 years.
The GHG feedback plays a leading role in determining
the magnitude of paleoclimate change and there is reason to
suspect that it may already be important in modern climate.
