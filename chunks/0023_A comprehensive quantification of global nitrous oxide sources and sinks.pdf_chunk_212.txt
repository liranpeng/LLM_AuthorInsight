Extended Data Fig. 8 | Global simulated N2O emission anomaly due to 
climate effect and global annual land surface temperature anomaly during 
1901â€“2016. Global N2O emission anomalies are the ensemble of six process-based 
land biosphere models in NMIP. The temperature data were obtained from the 
CRU-NCEP v8 climate dataset (https://vesg.ipsl.upmc.fr). a, The correlation
