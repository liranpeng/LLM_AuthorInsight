than high above it.
In the boundary layer, most clouds are above, and cloud
obscuration leads to increased occurrence of rlnJ < −0.025
compared to the middle troposphere (in both CAFS and mod-
els). Even though the frequency changes, the average magni-
tude of diminishment when there is cloud obscuration (de-
noted by Xs) does not change much across models in either
region. For CAFS in the tropical Paciﬁc, however, the dimin-
ishment when there is cloud obscuration is much larger in
