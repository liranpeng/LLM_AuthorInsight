use of nitrification inhibitors41,42). Success stories include the stabi-
lization or reduction of N2O emissions through improving nitrogen 
use efficiency in the United States and Europe, while maintaining or 
even increasing crop yields42,43. There is every reason to expect that 
additional implementation of more sustainable practices and emerg-
ing technologies will lead to further reduction of emissions in these 
regions. For example, N2O emissions from European agricultural soils
