Here, we focus on interannual variations using a 12-month running filter, and hence we present results 
centered on February 1, 2005 through July 1, 2018.
Over this period, the tropospheric mean abundance of N2O increased almost linearly from about 319 ppb 
(nanomoles per mole) to 330 ppb, or equivalently from a burden of 1,528 to 1,586 TgN (using a scaling 
factor of 4.79 TgN/ppb [Prather et al., 2012; Volk et al., 1997]). We want to analyze a stationary time series,
