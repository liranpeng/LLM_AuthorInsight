Figure 4. Annual-mean O3 column enhancements due to ship NOx
emissions with parametric plume chemistry. Values are calculated
from a 5 % emission perturbation and multiplied by 20. Inset num-
ber gives the global-mean change. Patterns are similar in the instant
dilution simulation, but with ﬁxed OPE, the O3 enhancements shift
toward high northern latitudes (Fig. 3).
