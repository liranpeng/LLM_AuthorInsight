requires, at a minimum, accurate models of the
chemistry and circulation of the atmosphere that
relate emissions to abundances. This DOE-funded
research provided realistic, yet computationally
optimized and affordable, photochemical modules to
the Community Earth System Model (CESM) that
augment the CESM capability to explore the
uncertainty in future stratospheric-tropospheric
ozone, stratospheric circulation, and thus the
lifetimes of chemically controlled greenhouse
