moisture, heat and momentum budgets (Lilly 1968, Bretherton and Wyant 1997, Wyant et al. 
1997, Stevens 2002, Stevens et al. 2002). In addition, cloud top entrainment controls how 
MBL clouds respond to increased greenhouse gases (Caldwell and Bretherton 2009) and 
atmospheric aerosols (Ackerman et al. 2004, Wood 2007, Bretherton et al. 2007).
Cloud System Evolution in the Trades (CSET) was developed to describe and explain the
