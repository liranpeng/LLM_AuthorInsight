1-D analysis, and they are normalized such that if all parcels
are distributed uniformly within a 20 × 20 square (e.g., 0.1–
1.0 ppb HOOH, 10–100 ppt NOx) the arbitrary density value
would be 1 (a yellow-green color in Figs. 6–7). Thus, the
reactivity-weighted 2-D plots are renormalized and do not
reﬂect the individual model’s total reactivity. In Fig. 6a the
AIR-weighted NOx–HOOH plots show a boomerang struc-
ture with greatly varying degrees of concentration about
