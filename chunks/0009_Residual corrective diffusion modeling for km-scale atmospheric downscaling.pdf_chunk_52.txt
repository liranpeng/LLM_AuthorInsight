found, alongside generated radar echos containing qualitatively
realistic km-scale details reminiscent of tropical cyclone rainband
morphology. It is logical to expect that the modelâ€™s accuracy could
be further improved with a larger training dataset that contains
more diverse examples of such rare coherent structures such as by
pre-training on large libraries of typhoons generated by high-
resolution physical simulators; we encourage work in this direction.
