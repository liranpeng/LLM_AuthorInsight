portance of parcels at altitudes above 500 hPa. For this Au-
gust test, most models ﬁnd that the 20–40◦N dominates (note
that plots are ppb day−1 and not area weighted), and the
60–40 and 40–20◦S domains are least important (similar
to OH structures in Spivakovsky et al., 2000; Lawrence et
al., 2001). Most models show increasing L-CH4 in the ﬁrst
