relative humidity over liquid water (RHw, %) be used to de-
tect bias. See the statistics on critical species and RHw in the

NOx version 3 and MDS ﬂags
When completing this paper’s analysis of the reactivi-
ties (Sect. 3) and re-examining the problems with NOx
(NO2+ NO) proﬁling that led to MDS version 2b (described
in G2023), we re-examined the NOx long-gap interpolation.
