natural; however, atmospheric production is affected to some extent 
by anthropogenic activities through enhancing the concentrations of 
the reactive species NH2 and NO2. This category is in any case very small 
and the anthropogenic enhancement effect is uncertain. Lightning 
produces NOx, the median estimate of which is 5 Tg N yr−1 (ref. 53). We 
assumed an emission factor of 1% (ref. 54) and a global estimate of 0.05 
(0.02–0.09) Tg N yr−1 from lightning. Atmospheric production of N2O
