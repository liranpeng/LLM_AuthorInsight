i
for
the shape-preserving version of the scheme, where i = 2,∞.
Gaussian hills and the non-divergent ﬂow ﬁeld are used for
the initial conditions. Normalized error norms are computed
after one period (T ) when the analytical solution is readily
available. The initial condition is inﬁnitely smooth (C∞) so
that the smoothness of the initial condition is not a limiting
factor for numerical convergence rates. With C1 initial condi-
tions, for example, one cannot necessarily expect to achieve
