exists. Our demonstrated ability to synthesize an observable
as challenging as radar reflectivity from column water vapor
should embolden such efforts.
These extensions have significant potential benefits such as
accelerated regional forecasts, increased ensemble sizes, improved
climate downscaling, and the provision of high-resolution regional
forecasts in data-scarce regions, leveraging training data from
adjacent areas.
