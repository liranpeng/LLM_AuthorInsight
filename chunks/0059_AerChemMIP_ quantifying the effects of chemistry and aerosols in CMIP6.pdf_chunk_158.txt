sea ice distribution, will help with the analysis of processes
(ﬁres, dynamics, volcanic perturbation, land cover change,
sea ice change) involved in the feedback process. Deposition
of nutrients such as nitrogen and dust has been suspected
to be involved in feedback processes (Collins et al., 2011).
Their output is thus requested too.

Chemistry–climate interactions
Chemistry–climate interactions involve impacts of composi-
tion on climate (as discussed in Sect. 4.1), but also crucially
