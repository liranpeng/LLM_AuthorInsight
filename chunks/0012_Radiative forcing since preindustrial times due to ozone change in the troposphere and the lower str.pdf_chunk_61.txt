tropical region. However, there are a number of limitations
to this inter-comparison.
Firstly, the low-latitude surface
measurements are made primarily in remote areas rather
than in the most prominent biomass burning areas, which
may account for the systematic higher modeled ozone
values. Secondly, the horizontal pattern of the emissions is
not changing with time, except for the seasonal cycle for
biomass burning and represents in most cases a speciÔ¨Åc
