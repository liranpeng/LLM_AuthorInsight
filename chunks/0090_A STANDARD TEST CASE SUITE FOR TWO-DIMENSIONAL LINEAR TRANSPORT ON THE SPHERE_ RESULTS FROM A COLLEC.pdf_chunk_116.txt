The distributions are placed into the western and eastern
hemisphere, respectively, so that model developers can inves-
tigate the symmetry of the computed solutions. A series of di-
agnostics are used to assess various aspects of accuracy. For
speciﬁc details on the test suite setup, we refer to LSPT2012.
Not all models provided a complete data set and/or ran
the suite exactly complying with the test case speciﬁcations.
When data are missing or non-existent in histograms, the
