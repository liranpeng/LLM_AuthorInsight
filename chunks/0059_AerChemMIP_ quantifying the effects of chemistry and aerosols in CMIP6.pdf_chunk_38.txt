stratospheric) and aerosols in ACCMIP were decoupled from
the CMIP5 climate model simulations that informed the
IPCC AR5 chapters on climate change (Bindoff et al., 2013;
Kirtman et al., 2013; Collins et al., 2013), this made it dif-
ﬁcult to relate the temperature responses to radiative forcing
due to NTCFs and also to constrain the climate sensitivity.
AerChemMIP is designed to ﬁll in this information gap to in-
form IPCC AR6. The lessons learned in AeroCom, ACCMIP,
