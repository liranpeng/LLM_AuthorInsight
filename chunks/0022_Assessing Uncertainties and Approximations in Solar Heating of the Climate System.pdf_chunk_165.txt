affect the EXP-RAN results. SH2010 find that the Tripleclouds versus binary clouds is a larger effect (−6 W 
m2). We support the SH2010 results that cloud overlap is major uncertainty in current models.
Unfortunately, Solar-J coding is not flexible enough to run RRTMG-style, McICA-like calculations. Thus 
we compare the two codes, each using their best simulation of MAX-RAN clouds: RRTMG v4.0 (MAX-RAN
