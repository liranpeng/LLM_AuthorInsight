ing to compare with free-running chemistry–climate models.
Using clustering algorithms, we deﬁne the size in space and
time of the episodes and the fraction of all events that oc-
cur within large clusters. In Sect. 6 we conclude and discuss
how to use the current climate archive Coupled Model Inter-
comparison Project Phase 5/Atmospheric Chemistry and Cli-
mate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5/ACCMIP), or
to design the next-generation chemistry–climate simulations,
