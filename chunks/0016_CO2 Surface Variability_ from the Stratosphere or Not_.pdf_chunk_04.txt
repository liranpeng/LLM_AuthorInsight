increases in greenhouse gases. It is also used to demonstrate
control of CO2 by the land biosphere and the oceans through
its annual cycles and interannual variations (Le Quéré et al.,
2016, 2018). The inverse modeling of surface sources based
on these CO2 observations is used to infer regional sources
of fossil fuel emissions as well as year-to-year changes in
primary productivity of the biosphere or oceanic degassing
(e.g., Gurney et al., 2002; Baker et al., 2006; Engelen et
