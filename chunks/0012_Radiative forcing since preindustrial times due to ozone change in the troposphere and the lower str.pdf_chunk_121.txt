ﬂux through 100 hPa from 15.9 109 kgs−1 to 16.9 109 kgs−1,
i.e. a 6% increase, from 1850 to 2000. This is mainly com-
pensated by an increased Northern Hemisphere extra-tropical
downward mass ﬂux, which increases by 9%. In the ULAQ
and NCAR MACCM models stratospheric ozone depletion
in high latitudes becomes less pronounced due to climate
change, while in DLR E39C it becomes more pronounced.
The increase of ozone almost everywhere in the tropo-
