Our findings point to growing N2O emissions in emerging econo-
mies—particularly Brazil, China and India. For example, we find here 
that the substantial increases in livestock manure left on pasture and 
in fertilizer use caused an increase of approximately 120% in Brazilian 
agricultural N2O emissions during 1980–2016 (Extended Data Fig. 9). 
In addition to fertilizer applications, the production of global livestock
