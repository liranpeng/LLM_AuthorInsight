ing modelling groups (see details on the CMIP Panel web-
site at http://www.wcrp-climate.org/index.php/wgcm-cmip/
about-cmip). In order to run the experiments, datasets for
natural and anthropogenic forcings are required. These forc-
ing datasets are described in separate invited contributions
to this Special Issue. The forcing datasets will be made
available through the ESGF (https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/
input4mips/) with version control and DOIs assigned.
