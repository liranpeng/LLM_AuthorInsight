atmosphere model, using training data obtained by spatially coarse‐graining a 40‐day realistic geography global storm‐resolving simulation. The training targets are the three‐dimensional fields of effective heating and moistening rates, including the effect of grid‐scale motions that are resolved but imperfectly simulated by the coarse model. A neural network is trained to predict the time‐dependent heating and moistening rates in each grid column using the coarse‐grained temperature, specific
