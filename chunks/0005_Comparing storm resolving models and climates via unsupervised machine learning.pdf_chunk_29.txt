and SAM differ significantly from the other models (Fig. S10, second and third rows vs. bottom six). These two 
divergent GSRMs contain high proportions of stronger convection types, consistent with our previous analysis 
(Fig. 3 and Figs.  S5–7, S9). For ICON, we find similarly pronounced differences in cluster proportions, showing 
a higher proportion of strong convection types (continental shallow and deep). While these were primarily
