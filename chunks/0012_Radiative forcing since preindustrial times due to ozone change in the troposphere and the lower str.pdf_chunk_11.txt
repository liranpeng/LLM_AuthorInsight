surements of UV at Thessaloniki, ﬁnding increases of solar
UV irradiance by more than 10% per decade for the period
1979–1997 and clearly relating them to reductions of mid-
latitude column ozone. Isaksen et al. (2005) investigated the
signiﬁcance of stratospheric ozone change for tropospheric
chemistry through changes in the actinic ﬂux. Stratospheric
ozone reduction was found to increase near-surface ozone in
polluted areas while reducing it in remote areas.
