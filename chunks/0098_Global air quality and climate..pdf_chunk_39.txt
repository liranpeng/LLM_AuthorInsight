estimated to be +0.48  0.05 W m2, second after CO2 in
terms of anthropogenic RF from greenhouse gases.10 An
estimate of the net RF associated with the preindustrial-to-
present growth in CH4 emissions includes the impact of CH4
on tropospheric O3, stratospheric water vapor, and aerosols.
From this ‘‘emission-based view’’, RF from CH4 almost doubles
from the abundance-based estimate to 0.8–1.0 W m2.44,45 The
high end of the range includes the indirect inﬂuence of changes
