(Table 1) the Atlantic mean is much larger (30 %–50 %) than
the Paciﬁc mean, and the extreme statistics are similar. What
is unusual is that ATom-1 has the lowest mean P-O3 in both
the Paciﬁc and Atlantic, while it has a high L-O3 or the high-
est L-O3. Thus, ATom-1 has a distinctly different mixture of
species than ATom-234. A clear seasonality is seen for L-O3,
with ATom-2 (February) having the lowest reactivities, pre-
sumably due to the reduced activity of northern mid-latitude
