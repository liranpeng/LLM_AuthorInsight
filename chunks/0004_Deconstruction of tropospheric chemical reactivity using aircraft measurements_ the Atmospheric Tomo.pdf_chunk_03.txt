the Modeling Data Stream (MDS), a continuous gap-Ô¨Ålled record of the 10 s parcels containing the chemical
species needed to initialize a gas-phase chemistry model for the budgets of tropospheric ozone and methane.
Global 3D models have been used to calculate the Reactivity Data Stream (RDS), which is comprised of the
chemical reactivities (production and loss) for methane, ozone, and carbon monoxide, through 24 h integration
