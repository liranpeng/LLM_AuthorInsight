OH, the latter can be efÔ¨Åciently recycled in the presence of
NOx. The reaction of NO with HO2 produces O3 and recy-
cles OH making the system less sensitive to perturbations.
Pristine regions with low NOx and high OH concentrations
conditions are favourable for OH-formation following ozone
production from NOx-perturbations. Since emissions from
the three transport sectors are emitted into rather different en-
vironments their impact on O3 and OH may differ strongly.
