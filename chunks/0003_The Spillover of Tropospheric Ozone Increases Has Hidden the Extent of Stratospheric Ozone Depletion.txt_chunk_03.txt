significant rates, that is, 13%–34% of the excess tropospheric burden appears in the lowermost extra‐tropical stratosphere. As we track the anticipated recovery of the observed ozone depletion, we should recognize that two tenths of that recovery may come from the transport of increasing tropospheric ozone into the stratosphere.
