For these species, the ATom–model agreement is generally
good. If anything, the models tend to have too much HOOH.
ATom shows systematically large occurrences of low HOOH
(50–200 ppt, especially in the central Paciﬁc), indicating,
perhaps, that convective or cloud scavenging of HOOH is
more effective than is modeled. HCHO shows reasonable
agreement in the Atlantic, but in both the central and eastern
Paciﬁc, the modeled low end (< 40 ppt) is simply not seen in
