capabilities.
2. 2.
Downscaling at different geographic locations: The primary
obstacle here is the scarcity of reliable kilometer-scale
weather data. Additionally, addressing the computational
scalability of CorrDiff for regions significantly larger than
Taiwan is crucial.

Downscaling future climate predictions: This introduces
further complexities related to conditioning probabilistic
predictions on various future anthropogenic emissions
