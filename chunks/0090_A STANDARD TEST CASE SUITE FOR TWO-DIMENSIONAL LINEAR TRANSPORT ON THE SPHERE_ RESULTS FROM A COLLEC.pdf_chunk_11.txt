port scheme development is the solid-body advection test
of the widely used shallow-water test case (cf. Williamson
et al., 1992). Speciﬁc guidelines for the computation of er-
ror norms and plotting (contour interval and projection) are
given in Williamson et al. (1992). However, resolution and
other transport model settings are not speciﬁed. In the lit-
erature modelers do not always chose the same resolution
and model settings, which can make it difﬁcult to compare
