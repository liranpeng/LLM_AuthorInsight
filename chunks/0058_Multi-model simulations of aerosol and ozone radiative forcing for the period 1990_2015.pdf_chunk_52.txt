Asia. The multi-model direct aerosol effect forcing of POA is
very similar to IPCC AR5 over the 1990–2010 period and is
generally small in magnitude (Fig. 4c). To a small degree, the
POA forcing acts to offset the positive forcing from BC and
sulfate over the period 1990–2015. SOA are included in a few
models, with forcing values over the 1990–2015 period gen-
erally of smaller magnitudes than POA. Three of the mod-
els have nitrate aerosols included, with a large range in the
