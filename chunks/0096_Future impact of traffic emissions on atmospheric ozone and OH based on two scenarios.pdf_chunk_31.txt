stratospheric chemistry were included in these simula-
tions.
An evaluation of these models can be found in H2011 for
comparisons with multi-year sonde observations of ozone
annual cycles, and in Schnadt et al. (2010) for comparisons
with CO aircraft measurements. The models have been run
with meteorological data from year 2003 in all simulations
