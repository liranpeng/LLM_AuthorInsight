NMHCs in these regions act as a direct sink, since solar ra-
diation is reduced.
Comparing the impact of road and ship trafÔ¨Åc, both sur-
face sources of air pollution, the effects on OH are very dif-
ferent, although the annual amount of emitted NOx is similar
(see Table 1). The zonal mean perturbation of road emis-
sions peaks at about 0.2% during northern summer and 0.1%
