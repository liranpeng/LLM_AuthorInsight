machine learning tasks. Currently, beyond the coherence of the
large scale conditioning given from ERA5 there is no guarantee that
CorrDiffâ€™s km-scale dynamics will be coherent in time. Additional
integrations with km-scale data assimilation are also essential for
this use case. Our current demonstration relies only on the global
data assimilation (DA) used to produce the ERA5 dataset. Unlike
the target data it is trained on, CorrDiff effectively bypasses the
