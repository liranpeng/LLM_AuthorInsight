proach that is practical with typical global model resolution
is the treatment of inhomogeneous cloud Ô¨Åelds as being com-
posed of independently scattering cloudlets (Petty, 2002).
This cloudlet approximation could be readily integrated into
the plane-parallel framework of Fast-J.
The added computational cost with G6/.33+AvQCA oc-
curs with the additional calls to Fast-J, as the MAX-COR
model and sorting of ICAs is fast. Computing photolysis
