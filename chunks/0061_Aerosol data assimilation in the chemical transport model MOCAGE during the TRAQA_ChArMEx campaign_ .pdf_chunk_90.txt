tion of the event is well simulated by both the direct model
run and the assimilation model run in all stations, but the
intensity is underestimated in the direct model run (Fig. 2).
However, the assimilation model run matches the outbreak
intensity well. The second, smaller desert dust event at the
end of the TRAQA period is only observed at southern sta-
tions. Similarly, the assimilation model run corrects its inten-
