climate change and its impact on nature and society. To
date, IPCC has generally adopted a single trajectory for the
growth of greenhouse gases in each of several different socio-
economic scenarios, thus neglecting uncertainty in those fu-
ture abundances. For methane, the second most important
anthropogenic GHG, these trajectories are based on sim-
ple parametric formulas for methane lifetime. In the IPCC
Third Assessment Report (TAR), 4 parameters accounted for
