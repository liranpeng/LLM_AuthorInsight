times for gases like nitrous oxide (N2O) and chloroﬂuoro-
carbons (CFCs) as greater abundances are pushed higher into
the tropical stratosphere, where they experience greater pho-
tolytic destruction. Two decades ago this mechanism was
proposed by Butchart and Scaife (2001) for the CFCs based
on dynamical diagnostics of the BDC from a climate model.
Now we have observed and quantiﬁed this effect for a ma-
jor greenhouse gas. Using the simultaneous MLS vertical
