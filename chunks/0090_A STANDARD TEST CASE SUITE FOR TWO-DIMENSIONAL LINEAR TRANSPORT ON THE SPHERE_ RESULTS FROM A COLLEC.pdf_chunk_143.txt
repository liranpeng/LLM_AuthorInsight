errors increase with larger CNs due to more of the ﬂux-area
integrations being based on extrapolation of reconstruction
functions.
For CAM-FV it is observed that the large CN solution
(CN = 1.2) has smaller absolute errors than the CN = 0.2
simulations (Fig. 2, row 1 and 2). Although the splitting
errors in the dimensionally split CAM-FV scheme increase
with CN, these errors do not dominate for this test case setup.
Semi-analytic “trajectories” were used (analytic wind evalu-
