Table 1 summarizes the climatologies of hemispheric O3 ﬂux for both meteorologies from C29 and C36.
They include the mean ﬂux (Flux), the seasonal (S-rms) and interannual (IA-rms) amplitudes, all in the unit
of Tg/yr. Also shown is the coeﬃcient obtained from correlating the interannual variation of each ﬂux with
