AGAGE surface stations (Montzka et al., 2000; Prinn et al., 2005),
with an uncertainty (shaded) given by the 16th to 84th percentile
range (±1σ) of decay rates across stations within each network,
and adjusted by the tropospheric OH fraction of total MCF loss. All
data are shown as anomalies relative to their own 2004–2010 mean
(2004–2008 for NOAA data). Models, observations, and uncertain-
