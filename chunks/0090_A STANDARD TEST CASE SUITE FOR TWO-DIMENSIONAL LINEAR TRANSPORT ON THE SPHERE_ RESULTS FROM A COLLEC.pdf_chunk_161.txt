show that there is not necessarily a correlation between “optimal”
convergence rate and “minimal” resolution.
resolution is the average resolution at the Equator, the reg-
ular latitude–longitude grids have more degrees of freedom
than cubed-sphere and icosahedral grid-based models. In this
discussion we have not considered how amenable spherical
grids and schemes are to mesh-reﬁnement applications.
