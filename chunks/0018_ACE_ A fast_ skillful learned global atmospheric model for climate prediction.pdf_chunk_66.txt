and dpi and Ti are the pressure thickness and temperature of the i’th atmospheric layer in the original
vertical coordinate and Ik is the index of the original vertical coordinate (fourth column of Table 2).
The pressure thickness dpi = pi+1 −pi is computed by taking the difference between the vertical
interface pressures given by Equation 2. The use of this finite volume vertical coordinate ensures
