of alternative fossil fuel use scenarios on the growth or de-
cline of atmospheric CO2. Assumptions about emissions in
the historical period are given in Appendix A9.
Figure 10a shows the simulated atmospheric CO2 for the
baseline emission cases (Fig. 9a). These cases do not in-
clude active CO2 removal. Five additional cases including
CO2 removal (Fig. 10b) achieve atmospheric CO2 targets
of either 350 or 450 ppm in 2100, with cumulative removal
