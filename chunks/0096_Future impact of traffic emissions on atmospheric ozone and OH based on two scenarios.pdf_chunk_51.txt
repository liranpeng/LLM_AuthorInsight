year 2000 towards 2025 and 2050 under the A1B scenario
is illustrated in Fig. 3. It is evident that AIR will have the
largest increase in O3 impacts during this period, particularly
between 2025 and 2050. The main reason is the assumed in-
crease of aircraft emissions (Fig. 1), but there is also a con-
tribution from reduced background levels of NOx stemming
from the rapid decrease of other anthropogenic emissions,
particularly from road trafÔ¨Åc, which will act to increase the
