These feedbacks through chemically active GHGs can either
dampen or exacerbate CO2-driven warming. Climate change
studies through Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects
(CMIPs) (e.g., Taylor et al., 2012; Eyring et al., 2016) have
generally chosen to prescribe greenhouse gas abundances
based on historical observations or projected emissions with
simple biogeochemistry box models. This approach works
for the well-mixed greenhouse gases but is a poor approxi-
