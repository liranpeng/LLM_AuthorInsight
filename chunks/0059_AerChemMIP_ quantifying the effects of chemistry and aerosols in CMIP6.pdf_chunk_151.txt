sistently will allow analysis of differences in aerosol optical
property calculations, as well as changes in aerosol humid-
ity growth in a changing climate and with changing emission
patterns. In combination with emissions in transient climate
simulations these diagnostics will allow complete analysis of
feedback processes; see below.
Another problem is which ambient humidity in the model
is picked to compute AOT. Some models compute an all-sky
