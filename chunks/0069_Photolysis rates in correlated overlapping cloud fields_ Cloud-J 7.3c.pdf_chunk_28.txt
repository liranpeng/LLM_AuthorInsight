Maximal groups with correlated overlap
The MAX-COR model generates ICAs from upper and lower
layers that are MAX groups. For a general approach, we as-
sume that the upper group G2 consists of N2 cloudy column
members with fractions f G2
1
+f G2
2
+f G2
3
+...+f G2
N2 = F G2
and one clear-sky column member of fraction 1âˆ’F G2. Sim-
ilarly, the lower group G1 has N1 + 1 ICAs (see Sect. 2.3).
Each of the N1 + 1 ICAs in group G1 are paired with the
