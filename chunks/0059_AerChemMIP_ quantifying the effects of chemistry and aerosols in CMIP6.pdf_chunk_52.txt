quality policies are applied, leading to much reduced NTCF
emissions. These perturbations are designed in collaboration
with ScenarioMIP to ensure that the NTCF perturbations are
consistent with the underlying storylines (see Sect. 3.2). A
comparison of the reference and perturbation simulation will
provide the background for understanding the effects of air
quality policies over the next few decades. Analysis of re-
sults from these simulations will be critical to understand
