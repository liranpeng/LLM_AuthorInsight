justment to other key species that will occur in response
to the decadal decay of a CH4 perturbation. The correct
way to model this is to run CTM and/or CCM perturba-
tion + control sequences for several years with different CH4
lower-boundary conditions (e.g., Holmes, 2018). During this
time other species, speciÔ¨Åcally CO, which is the other major
sink of OH radicals, will adjust to the CH4-driven changes
in OH. The CO change, an increase, will then further reduce
OH and amplify the ffCH4.
