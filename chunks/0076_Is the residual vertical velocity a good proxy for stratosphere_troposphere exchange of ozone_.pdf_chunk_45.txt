SH summer. The cause is the larger net photochemical production of O3 in the tropics extending to 30◦N
between the e90-tropopause and the two O3 isosurfaces.
The latitudinal distribution of the seasonal average (SON, DJF, MAM, and JJA) downward residual ﬂux across
the 100 hPa surface peaks in both hemispheres at 50–70 latitude (Figure 1f); whereas the TC-e90 ﬂux
(Figure 1g) peaks at 30◦–50◦latitude. In the SH, the downward residual ﬂux is conﬁned narrowly near 65◦S
