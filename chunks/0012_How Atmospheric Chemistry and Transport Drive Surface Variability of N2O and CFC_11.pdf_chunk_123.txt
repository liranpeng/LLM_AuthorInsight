Third, for the SH, the amplitude is reduced and there is a range of phases between the models. It is inter-
esting to note that the amplitude of the QBO in the mid-latitudes (box-whiskers on the annual cycles in 
FigureÂ 5) can be as large or larger than the annual cycle and confounds a simple separation of the STE flux 
into annual and interannual cycles from observations.
With the model experiments conducted here, it is difficult to assess how STE flux competes with SH sources
