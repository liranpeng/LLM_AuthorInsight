production of tropospheric ozone. Previous studies have shown a
large spread in effects on ozone layer depletion, ranging from up
to 10% in speciﬁc areas and under extreme adaption and leakage
scenarios19–21 to minor changes including small increases22,23.
Here, in the lower stratosphere at levels between 100 and 10 hPa,
the models all show only small changes to the ozone layer (Fig. 2).
