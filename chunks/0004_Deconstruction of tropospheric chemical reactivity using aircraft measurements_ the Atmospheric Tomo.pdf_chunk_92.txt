tiotemporal scales and origins of these events.
In the Arctic (Fig. 37), ATom-14 shows similar proﬁles
but with different shapes for each reactivity, while ATom-23
has negligible reactivities, as expected from the limited sun-
light. P-O3 peaks at 8–12 km with values from 1–2 ppb d−1,
while L-O3 and L-CH4 peak around 2–4 km. As in the cur-
tain plots, L-CO peaks with L-O3 in the lower troposphere
and also with P-O3 in the upper troposphere. The reactivities
