sible, but CO2 is by far the largest contributor to growth of
GHG climate forcing (Fig. 8). Nevertheless, given the difÔ¨Å-
culty and cost of reducing CO2, we must ask about the poten-
tial for reducing non-CO2 GHGs. Could realistic reductions
of these other gases substantially alter the CO2 abundance
required to meet a target climate forcing?
We conclude, as discussed in Appendix A13, that a net
decrease in climate forcing by non-CO2 GHGs of perhaps
