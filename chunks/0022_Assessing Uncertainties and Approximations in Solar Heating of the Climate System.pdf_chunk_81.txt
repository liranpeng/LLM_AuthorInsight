angles (streams) in upward and downward directions and average over the azimuth angle. Solar-J uses eight 
streams (four up, four down) to resolve multiple scattering and this RT solution is implemented in many 
global chemistry models (M. J. Prather, 2015). RRTM (Mlawer et al., 1997) uses 16-stream scattering but is 
not implemented in global models; instead, RRTMG (Clough et al., 2005) with 2-stream scattering is used
