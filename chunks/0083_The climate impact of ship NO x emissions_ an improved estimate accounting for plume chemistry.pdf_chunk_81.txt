resolution. Nevertheless, the O3 and CH4 responses to 5 %
increases in ship NOx emissions are unchanged from the
Ô¨Åner resolution. Given this resolution independence, we con-
duct additional sensitivity tests at coarse resolution for com-
putational expediency. A previous version of the model (9-
01-02) differs by less than 10 % in terms of ship NOx per-
turbations from the current version, despite improvements
to wet scavenging, sea-salt aerosol, and stratospheric chem-
