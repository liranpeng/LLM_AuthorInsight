look like Fu96. At very large SZA of 84◦, with most of the
sunlight being scattered at least once within the cloud, the
Solar-J model again looks like the largest τ, model EC92. To
ﬁrst order, the Solar-J model is calculating the correct SZA
dependence of the CRE by using both a more realistic scat-
tering phase function and eight-stream scattering. The use of
Mishchenko’s sample T-matrix phase function may not be a
perfect choice for cirrus, but it is clearly more realistic than
