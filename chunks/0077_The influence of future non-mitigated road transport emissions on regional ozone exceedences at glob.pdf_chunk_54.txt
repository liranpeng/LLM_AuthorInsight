creases in ER during 2025 of <0.1 occur over the Mediterranean and
appear in spite of the projected increase in shipping emissions
(Eide et al., 2007; Hodnebrog et al., 2011), with unmitigated RTE
contributing an additional w1e2 ppb (not directly shown). This is
due to cleaner air being transported from the continent out over the
region as a result of the effective mitigation of the NTS emissions in
e.g. the Po Valley in Italy (c.f. Fig. 2).
