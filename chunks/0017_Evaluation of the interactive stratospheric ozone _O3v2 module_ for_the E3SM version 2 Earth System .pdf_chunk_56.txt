nual mean, but only June and October plus the annual mean
are included in Fig. 4. We avoid the lowermost stratosphere
where zonal variability is large and restrict ourselves to a
pressure range of 100 to 0.2 hPa (approximately 16 to 50 km
altitude). The goal in terms of matching the ozone proﬁles
(not usually quantiﬁed) was to get peak ozone above 10 ppm
at 10 hPa in the tropics and the slightly upturned contours
(i.e., at 5 hPa the 6 ppm contours extend over a wider latitude
