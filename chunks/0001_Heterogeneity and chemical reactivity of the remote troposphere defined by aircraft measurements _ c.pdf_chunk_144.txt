observations and photochemical reactivity (e.g., eastern Pa-
ciÔ¨Åc mid-troposphere in August, Fig. 2). The many corol-
lary species measured by ATom (not directly involved in CH4
and O3 chemistry) can provide clues to the origin or chem-
ical processing of these environments. We hope to engage a
wider modeling community beyond the ATom science team,
as in H2018, in the calculation of photochemical processes,
budgets, and feedbacks based on all four ATom deployments.
