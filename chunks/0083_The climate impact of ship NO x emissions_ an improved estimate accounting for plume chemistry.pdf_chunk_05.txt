ship NOx emissions, such as the increase since preindus-
trial times, is about 20 % larger than this RF value for small
marginal emission changes. Using sensitivity tests in one
CTM, we quantify sources of uncertainty in the RF com-
ponents and causes of the ±30 % spread in past model re-
sults; the main source of uncertainty is the composition of
the background atmosphere in the CTM, which is driven by
model formulation (±10 to 20 %) and the plausible range of
anthropogenic emissions (±10 %).
