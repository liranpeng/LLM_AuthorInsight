in soils and atmospheric oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH).
The largest term, and the largest uncertainty term in the atmo-
spheric hydrogen budget is the soil uptake, which in most studies
accounts for 65–85% of the total hydrogen sink4–6. The atmo-
spheric lifetime of hydrogen, deﬁned as the total atmospheric
burden divided by the total sinks, is about 2 years4.
Any Earth-system perturbation that impacts tropospheric
chemistry creates a complex chain of events that alter radiatively
