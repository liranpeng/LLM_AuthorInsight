ogy (Price and Rind, 1994) and scaled to match satellite-
observed lightning ﬂash rates (Christian et al., 2003). In the
UCI CTM and Oslo CTM3, 2 scale factors are calculated to
match observed multi-year mean ﬂash rates over land and
ocean. In GEOS-Chem scale factors are calculated for ev-
ery grid column and month (Sauvage et al., 2007). Within
the convective column, lightning NOx is distributed verti-
cally based on NOx observations near thunderstorms (Ott
