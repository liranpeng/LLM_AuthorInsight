emissions (TCRE)
The transient climate response (TCR), deﬁned as the global
warming at year 70 in response to a 1 % yr−1 CO2 in-
crease, for our simple Green’s function climate model
is 1.89 ◦C with energy imbalance of 1.52 W m−2 at that
point; this TCR is in the middle of the range reported
in the IPCC AR5 report (IPCC, 2013). We calculate
the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emis-
sions (TCRE) of our climate plus carbon cycle model as in
