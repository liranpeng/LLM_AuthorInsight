would greatly reduce the numerical noise generated by McICA random selection. It is easy to implement 
in any code, but would increase the computational costs by a factor of 2.8. There is a broad interest 
reducing the stochastic noise in heating rates, particularly at high resolution (H. W. Barker & Li,Â 2019).
