diative forcing of short-lived components (Flato et al., 2013;
Myhre et al., 2013b). The short-lived components, notably
ozone and atmospheric aerosols, are more difÔ¨Åcult to quan-
tify in terms of abundance and radiative forcing through
atmospheric measurements than the greenhouse gases with
lifetimes on the order of decades or longer. Abundances
of short-lived components depend on location of emission
and are inhomogeneously distributed in the atmosphere, with
