mate of the observed standard deviation of the CO on the
Palmdale–Anchorage (Fig. S4) and Anchorage–Kona ﬂights
(Table 2). In addition to biases in emissions, observations
often show ﬁne-scale structures too small for the model to
resolve (Hsu et al., 2004), and underestimating the concen-
trations in strong plumes is a common problem for global
models (e.g., Heald et al., 2003). Either biases in emissions
or insufﬁcient vertical or horizontal model resolution may
