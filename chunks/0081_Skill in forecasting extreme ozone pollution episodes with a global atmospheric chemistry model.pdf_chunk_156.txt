large fraction of the excess MDA8 O3. We test the ability
the UCI CTM to hindcast the 1000 km, multiday giant AQX
episodes that include most of the individual, cell-based AQX
events. Although we have no formal error estimate of the
gridding procedure, we feel our quality of prediction (QP)
provides a similar quantity, as shown with both the obser-
vations themselves (Fig. 2) and with the ability of the UCI
CTM to hindcast AQX events (Fig. S4 in the Supplement).
