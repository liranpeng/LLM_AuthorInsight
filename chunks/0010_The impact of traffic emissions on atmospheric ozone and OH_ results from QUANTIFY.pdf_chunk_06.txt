scaling to 100%. On the global average the impact of road
even dominates in the UTLS-region. The sensitivity of ozone
formation per NOx molecule emitted is highest for aircraft
exhausts.

The local maximum effect of the summed trafÔ¨Åc emissions
on the ozone column predicted by the models is 0.2 DU and
occurs over the northern subtropical Atlantic extending to
central Europe. Below 800 hPa both ozone and OH respond
