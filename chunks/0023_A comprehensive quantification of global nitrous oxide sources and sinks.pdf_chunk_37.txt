Fig. 1 | Global N2O budget for 2007–2016. The coloured arrows represent N2O 
fluxes (in Tg N yr−1 for 2007–2016) as follows: red, direct emissions from 
nitrogen additions in the agricultural sector (agriculture); orange, emissions 
from other direct anthropogenic sources; maroon, indirect emissions from 
anthropogenic nitrogen additions; brown, perturbed fluxes from changes in
