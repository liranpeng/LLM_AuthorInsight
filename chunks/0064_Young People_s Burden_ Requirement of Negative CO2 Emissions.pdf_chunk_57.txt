and Jones (2010) estimated global temperature in the Eemian
as 1.5–2 ◦C warmer than the Holocene (Fig. 3), but Bakker
and Renssen (2014) point out two biases that may cause this
range to be an overestimate. Bakker and Rennsen (2014)
use a suite of models to estimate that the assumption that
maximum Eemian temperature was synchronous over the
planet overestimates Eemian temperature by 0.4 ± 0.3 ◦C –
a feature supported by a lack of synchroneity of warmest
