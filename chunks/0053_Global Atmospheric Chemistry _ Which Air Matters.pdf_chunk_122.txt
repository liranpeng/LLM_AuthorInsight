(row 1), L-CH4 (row 2), L-O3 (row 3), and P-O3 (row 4). The domain being sampled in the models is the tropical Paciﬁc: 20◦S–20◦N,
150–210◦E, 0.5–12 km. Units for the air weighting are petamoles per bin where the bins are set at 20 per decade (sizes marked by dashed
lines in upper or lower panels) and Mmoles per bin per day for the reactivity-weighted plots (rows 2–4).
