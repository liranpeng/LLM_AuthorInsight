N2O abundance and growth rates. This supports our simplistic proposal above that an equatorial source of 
∼1 TgN during the 2010 La Niña can explain the observed anomaly.
We have a unique capability here in that we have three independent CTMs generating N2O surface patterns 
that include all the chemistry and transport, but without emissions. The dynamical link between the QBO 
and ENSO is unclear (Coy et al., 2017) and poorly reproduced in models (Serva et al., 2020). Nevertheless,
