peak distributions at rlnJ ∼0 appear to be basically incorrect
since averages over these model resolutions (> 0.5◦) should
reduce clear-sky occurrence. There is probably a sweet spot
in model resolution at about 20 km where the model statis-
tics, even with 1-D RT, should match the observed statistics.
