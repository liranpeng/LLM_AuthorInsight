Forecast System. The model is conﬁgured as described by
Tang and Prather (2010, 2012a, b). Simulations are 1◦× 1◦
resolution with 40 vertical layers, which is amongst the high-
est resolution for current global chemistry models, and cov-
ers 2005–2006, which is the duration of the high-resolution
meteorological ﬁelds. The lowest model layer is about 80 m
thick, and we use that layer-mean value as the surface O3
concentration. MDA8 values are calculated from hourly sim-
