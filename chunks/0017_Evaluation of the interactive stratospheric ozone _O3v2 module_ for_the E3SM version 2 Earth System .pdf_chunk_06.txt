port modeling because ozone has two chemically distinct
regions (stratosphere versus troposphere) with a very sharp
interface at the tropopause. The importance of two-way in-
teraction between chemically active GHGs and physical cli-
mate change has been recognized in previous studies as oc-
curring through changes in radiation, temperature, dynamics,
and the hydrological cycle (e.g., Isaksen et al., 2009; Raes
et al., 2010; Dietm√ºller et al., 2014; Nowack et al., 2015).
