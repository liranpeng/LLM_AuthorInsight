2013). Our two cases with rapidly declining emissions never
achieve 1000 PgC emissions, but TCRE can still be com-
puted using the IPCC formulae, yielding TCRE = 1.31 and
1.25 ◦C per 1000 PgC at 2100 for the cases of −3 and
−6 % yr−1 respective emission reductions. As expected, the
rapid emission reductions substantially reduce the tempera-
ture rise in 2100.
