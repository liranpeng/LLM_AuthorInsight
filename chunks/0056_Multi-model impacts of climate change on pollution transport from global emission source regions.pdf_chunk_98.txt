2005 (present day). Bottom panels: differences between 2090–2099 (RCP 8.5) and 1996–2005 (present day) DJF climatological mean
convective mass ﬂuxes, wherein black contours denote the present-day climatology. Results are presented for UM-CAM and STOC-HadAM3
(top panels) and CMAM and GISS-E2-R (bottom panels). Grey shading indicates where results are not signiﬁcant at p < 0.05 as evaluated
