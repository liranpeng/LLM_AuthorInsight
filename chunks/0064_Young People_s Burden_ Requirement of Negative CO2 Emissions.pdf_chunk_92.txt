from methane hydrates and permafrost contributed to climate
change in past warm periods (Zachos et al., 2008; DeConto
et al., 2012) and potentially could have a signiﬁcant effect in
the future (O’Connor et al., 2010; Schädel et al., 2016).
Paleoclimate data help assess the possible timescale for
ice sheet change. Ice sheet size, judged from sea level,
varies almost synchronously with temperature for the tem-
poral resolution available in paleoclimate records, but Grant
