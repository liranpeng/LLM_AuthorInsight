way for limiting near term climate change (Shindell et al.,
2012). These reactivities are deﬁned in terms of the follow-
ing speciﬁc rates:
CH4 + OH →CH3 + H2O,
(R1)
HO2 + NO →NO2 + OH,
(R2a)
RO2 + NO →NO2 + RO,
(R2b)
O3 + OH →O2 + HO2,
(R3a)
O3 + HO2 →HO + O2 + O2,
(R3b)
O(1D) + H2O →OH + OH.
(R3c)
L-O3 is rate (R1); P -O3 is rates (R2a and b); L-O3 is
rates (R3a–c). All of the analysis here occurs at pressures
> 200 hPa and thus the P-O3 term from photolysis of O2,
