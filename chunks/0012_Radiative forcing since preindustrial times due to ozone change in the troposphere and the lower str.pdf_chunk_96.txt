exists concerning the magnitude and the exact location. For
instance, the ULAQ model yields maximum Antarctic ozone
depletion at higher altitudes than the other models, while
the DLR E39C and UIO CTM2 models seem to underes-
timate ozone depletion in the Antarctic lower stratosphere
compared to what has been observed.
The calculated change of ozone precursors (not shown)
explains in part the differences in modeled ozone change.
For example, the maximum annually averaged zonal-mean
