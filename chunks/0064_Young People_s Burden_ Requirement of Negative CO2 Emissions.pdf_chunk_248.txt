fuel emissions have increased by a factor of 4 over the past
half century, the ocean and biosphere have continued to take
up about half of the emissions (Fig. A8, right-hand scale).
This seemingly simple relation between emissions and at-
mospheric CO2 growth is not predictive as it depends on the
growth rate of emissions being maintained, which is not true
in cases with major changes in the emission scenario, so we
use a carbon cycle model in Sect. 7 to compute atmospheric
