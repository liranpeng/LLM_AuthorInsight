liminary data in a manner similar to what has been adopted
in past studies (e.g., Stevens et al., 2005; vanZanten et al.,
2011), albeit (in the present case) over considerably larger
domains. Figure 20 shows, with the help of a satellite im-
age, the degree of mesoscale cloud variability. This apparent
whimsicality suggests that, given the imprecision in the forc-
ing and the cloud retrievals, assessing the magnitude of sys-
tematic biases in the simulations will be a challenge. In this
