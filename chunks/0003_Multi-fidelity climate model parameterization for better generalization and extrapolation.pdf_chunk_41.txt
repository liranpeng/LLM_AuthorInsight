accurate model. The coefficient of determination is upper-
bounded by 1 and values closer to 1 correspond to more
accurate models (Methods).

For the heat tendency, the MF-RPN is the only model with
positive global R2 values for all vertical levels, with an av-
erage R2 of 0.62 across all levels (figure 2.a and figure 6.a
in Supplementary Information showing the negative values
for R2 where appropriate). Besides, MF-RPN is always the
