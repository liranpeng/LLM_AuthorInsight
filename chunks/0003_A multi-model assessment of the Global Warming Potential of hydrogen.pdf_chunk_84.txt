the hydrogen ﬂux (W m-2 (Tg yr−1)−1). The indirect forcing via methane is added
by normalizing the forcing by the methane ﬂux and multiply by the methane ﬂux
per hydrogen ﬂux (Tg CH4 (Tg H2)−1) from the PERT_H2 experiment.
GWP calculations. GWPH2 is the ratio of the absolute global warming potential
(AGWP) for hydrogen relative to that for CO2. AGWP is deﬁned as the time-
integrated radiative forcing of a 1 kg pulse emission of that gas over a given time
