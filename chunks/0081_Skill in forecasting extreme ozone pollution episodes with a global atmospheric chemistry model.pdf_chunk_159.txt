the recent IPCC assessment (CMIP5/ACCMIP).
One advantage of the approach here is that it can be read-
ily applied to satellite observations. The regridding allows
for somewhat sparse measurements resulting from day-to-
day cloud obscuration to be ﬁlled to a regular grid with a
measure of the quality of the prediction (QP). Our deﬁnition
of AQX events takes into account natural gradients in aerosol
optical depth or tropospheric ozone column.
