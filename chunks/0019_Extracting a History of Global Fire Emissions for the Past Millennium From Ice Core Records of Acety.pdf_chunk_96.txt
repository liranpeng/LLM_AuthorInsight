of whether such changes could reconcile the burning histories from the three trace gases. These scenarios are
described below.
1. All savanna/grassland (all‐SAV) — This scenario is designed to examine the possibility that trace gas
emission factors were different in the past due to variations in the spatial patterns of the types of vegeta-
tion (Pongratz et al., 2008). As an extreme case, we assumed that all the paleobiomass from the non‐boreal
