relative to the reference simulation by categorizing more columns as out‐of‐sample. Without novelty detection, corrective ML occasionally causes undesirably large climate biases. When coupled to a running year‐long coarse‐grid simulation, novelty detection deems about 21% of columns to be novelties. This identification reduces the spread in the root‐mean‐square error (RMSE) of time‐mean spatial patterns of surface temperature and precipitation rate across a random seed ensemble. In particular,
