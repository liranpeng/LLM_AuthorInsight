age. At very large air masses (solar zenith angles of 89–95◦)
the atmospheric path (vertical optical path ×1/cos(SZA)) in
the Chappuis band approaches 1 and modest errors appear.
If highly accurate calculation of the photolysis and heat-
ing rates due in the Chappuis band is required, then fur-
ther analysis of bin 18 is warranted, but otherwise this treat-
ment is sufﬁciently accurate to follow these rates as the sun
sets. Another possible source of error is that these cross sec-
