crease to about 0.5 ppb/d below 2 km. This pattern indicates
that in the middle of the Paciﬁc, the NOx + HOx combina-
tion that produces ozone is suppressed throughout the lower
troposphere in all the models. In the eastern Paciﬁc and At-
lantic, both models’ and ATom reactivities indicate that P-O3
is greatly enhanced above 6 km as compared to the central
Paciﬁc, but below 6 km ATom P-O3 is much larger than that
of the models’, by a factor of 2. In the upper troposphere, the
