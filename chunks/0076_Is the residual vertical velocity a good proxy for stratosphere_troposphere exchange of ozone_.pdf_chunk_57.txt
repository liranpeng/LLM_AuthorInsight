below) are calculated relative to the TC-e90 ï¬‚ux, our best estimate. The TC (solid) and LS (dashed) methods
are shown for both e90 tropopause (black) and the 250 ppb surface (red). For the most part, these four lines
in Figures 1h and 1i are indistinguishable. Fluxes across 100 hPa are shown for both residual (dashed green)
and simulated values (solid green). The period from years 2000 to 2007 is relatively quiet climatologically
