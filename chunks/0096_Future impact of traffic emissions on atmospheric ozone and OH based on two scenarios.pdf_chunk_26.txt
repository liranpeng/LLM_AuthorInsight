trast to the B1 scenario when major reductions over Europe
and the US are assumed (Fig. 2 in H2011). Similarly, NOx
emissions from SHIP will increase along nearly all shipping
routes from 2000 to 2050 if emissions evolve according to
the A1B scenario (Fig. 1). On the contrary, emissions from
ROAD are expected to decline rapidly towards the middle
of this century in nearly all regions except in India and China
where these emissions are expected to increase between 2000
and 2025.
