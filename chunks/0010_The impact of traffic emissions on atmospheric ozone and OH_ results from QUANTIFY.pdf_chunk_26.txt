Aircraft emissions are based on the AERO2K dataset (Eyers
et al., 2004) including the emissions from military aviation.
The emissions for each transport sector are given in Table 1.
Non-trafÔ¨Åc emissions used in the present modelling exer-
cise are based on the latest release of the EDGAR32FT2000
emission inventory (van Aardenne et al., 2005; Olivier
