AOD values, different air masses enter and exit our trajec-
tory based on their different transport velocities and direc-
tions. Thus, aerosols that are assimilated at different places
later can be gathered in one vertical proﬁle. Then, the con-
tinuous multicycle assimilation can additionally amplify or
reduce these differences in a proﬁle. In Fig. 10a and b, the
change of the proﬁle shape is noticeable on 28 and 29 June
when the plume is near the coast of Morocco. The assimila-
