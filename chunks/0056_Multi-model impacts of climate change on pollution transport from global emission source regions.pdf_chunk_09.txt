R. M. Doherty et al.: Multi-model impacts of climate change on pollution transport
pollutant distributions, it is therefore important to disentan-
gle the relative impacts of changes in transport and chemistry
as well as future emission changes. The focus of this study is
to quantify climate change impacts on atmospheric transport.
In the tropics, the Hadley circulation determines the lo-
cation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) (e.g.
