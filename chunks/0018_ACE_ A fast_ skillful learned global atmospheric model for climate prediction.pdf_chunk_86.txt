violation is up to magnitude 0.4 mm/day.
We also consider the conservation of global dry air mass. Surface pressure due to dry air only is
pdry
s
= ps −g · TWP.

On the timescales we are considering, there is no flux of dry air mass through the top of atmosphere
or through the Earth’s surface. Therefore, the global mean surface pressure due to dry air should
remain exactly constant. Indeed this is the case for the reference model. The right panel of Figure 11
