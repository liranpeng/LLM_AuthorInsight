face. These errors will not directly affect the model results
here since the cloudyâ€“clear differences used a self-consistent
albedo in each model. Overall, however, there is a need for
chemistry models to implement a more physically realistic
OSA.

Discussion
The importance of clouds in altering photolysis rates (Js)
and thence tropospheric chemistry is undisputed. On a case
level it is readily observed, and on a global level, every model
