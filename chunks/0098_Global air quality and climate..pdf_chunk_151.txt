aerosol cloud interactions. However, large variability between
models87,130 highlights the need for detailed evaluation of aerosol
microphysical schemes before uncertainty in aerosol forcing can
be reduced. Synthesis of Ô¨Åeld observations to develop datasets
with global coverage to evaluate models will be important. New
approaches are also required to understand the microphysical
processes that are most responsible for model diversity helping to
prioritize future research directions.336
