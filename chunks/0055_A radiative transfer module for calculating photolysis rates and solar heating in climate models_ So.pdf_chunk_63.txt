SZAs (21, 62, 84◦) are shown in Table 5 under clear-sky
columns.
In Table 4, the incoming spectral solar irradiance at top
of the atmosphere (TOA down) is balanced by components
of (1) the reﬂected ﬂux going back to space (TOA up pos-
itive), (2) the absorption in the atmosphere, separated into
the stratosphere and troposphere, and (3) surface heating.
Several differences in the conﬁguration of spectral bands
between Solar-J and RRTMG-SW affect these results. For
