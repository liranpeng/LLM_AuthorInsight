time of CH4 and the cycling of tropospheric O3.
So what makes this model vs. measurement comparison
different? The atmospheric chemistry community has a his-
tory of such comparisons, including photolysis rates, dat-
ing to the early ozone depletion assessments (Nack and
Green, 1974; M&M, 1993) and continuing to recent multi-
model projects (Olson et al., 1997; Crawford et al., 2003;
PhotoComp, 2010). These comparisons have been limited
mostly to simplistic atmospheric conditions and measure-
