eas associated with high variability, so the covariance func-
tion could easily be incorrectly modeled at short separation
distances. Consequently, the Kriging weights given to these
clustered stations would not necessarily provide the desired
declustering. For this reason, we use a modiÔ¨Åed from of IDW
that incorporates a declustering scheme without the need to
model the underlying covariance function.
From O3 observations Zk at sites xk, we interpolate the O3
