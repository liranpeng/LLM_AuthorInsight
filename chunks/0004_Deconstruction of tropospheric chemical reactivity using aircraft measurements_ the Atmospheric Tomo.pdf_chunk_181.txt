(µm2 cm−3) in Fig. 65. We calculate SAD as the sum of
the four reported modes (nucleation, Aitken, accumulation,
and coarse), with most of the area coming from the accu-
mulation and coarse modes. In the Paciﬁc, above the marine
boundary layer, SAD is usually < 20 µm2 cm−3), while in the
Atlantic SAD is much larger, 20–80 µm2 cm−3, everywhere
below 4 km. This difference is extensive in all seasons and
is clearly due to low-altitude continental convection from,
