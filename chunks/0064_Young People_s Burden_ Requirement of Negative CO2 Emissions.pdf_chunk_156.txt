on carbon storage in forests and soil might have potential
to provide a carbon sink substantially larger than 100 PgC
this century. Smith et al. (2016) estimate that reforestation
and afforestation together have carbon storage potential of
about 1.1 PgC yr−1. However, as forests mature, their uptake
of atmospheric carbon decreases (termed “sink saturation”),
thereby limiting CO2 drawdown. Taking 50 years as the av-
erage time for tropical, temperate and boreal trees to experi-
