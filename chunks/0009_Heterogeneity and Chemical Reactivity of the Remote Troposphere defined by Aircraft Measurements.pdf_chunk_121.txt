Figure 4. Histograms of probability densities (PDs) of NOx (0–12 km, row 1), NOx (0–4 km, row 2), HOOH (0–12 km, row 3) and HCHO
(0–12 km, row 4) for the three tropical regions (central Paciﬁc, eastern Paciﬁc, Atlantic). The ATom-1 data are plotted on top of the six global
chemistry models’ results for a day in mid-August and sampled as described in Fig. 3.
