intervals. RCPn.n^ lifetimes are from ACCMIP results (Voulgarakis et al., 2013) scaled to 11.2 ± 1.3 yr for year 2000; the ACCMIP mean and standard deviation in 2000 are 9.8 ± 1.5 yr. Projected 
ACCMIP values combine the present day uncertainty with the model standard deviation of future change. Note that the total atmospheric lifetime of CH4 must include other losses (e.g., stratosphere, 
surface, tropospheric chlorine), and for 2010 it is 9.1 ± 0.9 yr, see Chapter 8, Section 11.3.5.1.1.
