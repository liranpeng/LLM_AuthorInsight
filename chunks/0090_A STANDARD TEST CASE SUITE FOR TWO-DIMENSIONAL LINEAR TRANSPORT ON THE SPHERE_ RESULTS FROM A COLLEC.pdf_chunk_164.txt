semi-Lagrangian and Eulerian schemes.
One such diagnostic is the ﬁlament diagnostic that is de-
signed to diagnose how well the thin ﬁlaments that develop
at t = T /2 are preserved. It takes advantage of the fact that
in continuous space the area spanned by tracer values larger
than some threshold value is conserved for a non-divergent
ﬂow ﬁeld. The ﬁlament diagnostic, ℓf (for a mathematical
deﬁnition of ℓf, see LSPT2012), is designed to quantify how
