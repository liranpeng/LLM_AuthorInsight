of the SZA of 84◦where the low-angle scattering driven by
the low solar elevation produces relatively much more atmo-
spheric heating.
In-cloud heating (third row) is expected to be proportional
to τabs at high sun (SZA = 0–62◦), and for ﬂux-weighted
bins S25–S27 these τabs are 0.31 (EC92), 0.21 (Solar-J), 0.17
(Key02), and 0.16 (Fu96). While the actual heating of the cir-
rus ice particles may be in similar proportionality, all we cal-
