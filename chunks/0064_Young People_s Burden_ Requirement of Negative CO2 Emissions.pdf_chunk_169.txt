above the Holocene level small enough and brief enough
that it has the best chance of avoiding ice sheet instabilities
and multi-meter sea level rise (Hansen et al., 2016). If fossil
fuel emission phasedown of 6 % yr−1 had begun in 2013, as
proposed by Hansen et al. (2013a), this scenario would have
been achieved via the hypothesized 100 PgC carbon extrac-
tion from improved agricultural and forestry practices.
We examine here scenarios with 6 and 3 % yr−1 emission
