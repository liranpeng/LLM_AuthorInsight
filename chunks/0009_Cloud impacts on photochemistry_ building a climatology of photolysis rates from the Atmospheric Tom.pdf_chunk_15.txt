ployment (29 July through 23 August 2016). We build up
statistics of the observed J value relative to that calculated
for a clear sky under similar conditions. The chemical reac-
tivity of the troposphere (see Prather et al., 2017) is generally
proportional to these changes in J values, and thus modeling
of the variability of clouds is critical for modeling the life-
