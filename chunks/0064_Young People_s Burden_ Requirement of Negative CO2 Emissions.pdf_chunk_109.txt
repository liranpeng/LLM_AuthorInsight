(Fig. 8b), through rapid reduction of GHG emissions, along
10This scenario is discussed by Hansen and Sato (2004). CH4
emissions decline moderately, producing a small negative forcing.
CO2 emissions (not captured and sequestered) are assumed to de-
cline until in 2100 fossil fuel emissions just balance uptake of CO2
by the ocean and biosphere. CO2 emissions continue to decline af-
ter 2100.
