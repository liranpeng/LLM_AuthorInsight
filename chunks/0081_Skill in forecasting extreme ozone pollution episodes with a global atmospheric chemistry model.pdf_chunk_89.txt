lated using independent sampling are 7 ± 3 ppb (5 ± 2 ppb)
less than concurrent sampling for the US (EU); however for
increasing percentiles the trend reverses, with biases for inde-

greater than concurrent sampling for the US (EU). We con-
clude that O3 PDFs simply cannot be used in comparing ob-
servations with climate models.
