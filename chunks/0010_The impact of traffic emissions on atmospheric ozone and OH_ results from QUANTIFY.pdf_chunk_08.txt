Methane lifetime changes against OH are affected
strongest by ship emissions up to 0.21 (± 0.05)%, followed
by road (0.08 (±0.01)%) and air trafﬁc (0.05 (± 0.02)%).
Based on the full scale ozone and methane perturbations pos-
itive radiative forcings were calculated for road emissions
(7.3±6.2 mWm−2) and for aviation (2.9±2.3 mWm−2).
Ship induced methane lifetime changes dominate over the
ozone forcing and therefore lead to a net negative forcing
(−25.5±13.2 mWm−2).
