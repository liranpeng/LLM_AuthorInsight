those operated beyond 72 h (Table 2).
Odds of 30-day mortality was 1.43 (CI 1.057–1.988, 
p = 0.025) for delay to surgery from admission of over 12 h 
compared to under 12 h (Table 3). Odd ratios for 30-day 
mortality were not significant at any other time threshold. 
Age, gender, ASA, MTS, mobility score and fracture type 
remained significant on multivariate analysis (Fig. 2).
Similar demographics were demonstrated for the sub-
group where time of fall was available (Table 4). The same
