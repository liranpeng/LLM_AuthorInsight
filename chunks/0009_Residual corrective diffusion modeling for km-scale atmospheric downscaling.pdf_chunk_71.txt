where y and x are the input and target respectively. This signal
decomposition is inspired by Reynolds decomposition in fluid-
dynamics39 and climate data analytics. Assuming the regression
learns the conditional mean accurately, i.e., \({\mathbf{\mu
}}\approx {\mathbb{E}}[{\bf{x}}| {\bf{y}}]\), the residual is zero
mean, namely \({\mathbb{E}}[{\bf{r}}| {\bf{y}}]\approx 0\), and
