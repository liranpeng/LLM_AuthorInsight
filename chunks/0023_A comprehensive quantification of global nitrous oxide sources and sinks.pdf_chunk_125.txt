in aquaculture, the same emission factor used in ref. 62 and ref. 31. The 
uncertainty range of the emission factor is from 0.5% (ref.14) to 5% 
(ref. 63), the same range used in the UNEP report9. The ‘Aquaculture’ 
emission for the period 2007–2016 was estimated through synthesizing 
multiple sources of data from ref. 62 in 2009, the FAO report31 in 2013 
and our calculations. The estimate of aquaculture N2O emission before 
2009 was from our calculations only.
