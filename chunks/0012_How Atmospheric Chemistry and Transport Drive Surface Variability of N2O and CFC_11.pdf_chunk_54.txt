coefficient, cc = 0.86); while for GMI (cc = 0.45) and LMDz5 (cc = 0.32), the variations occur at different 
times. In 2013, GMI shows an extra peak loss (i.e., due to enhanced upwelling) that is not seen in the other 
models or observations, which may account for the lower correlation. For the 15-year period before MLS 
(1990–2004), the models show a similar overall range of variability, but less temporal correlation between
