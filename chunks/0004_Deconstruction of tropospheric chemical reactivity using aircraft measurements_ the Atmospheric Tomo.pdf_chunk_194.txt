tion relative to its steady-state lifetime (Prather, 1994, 1996).
A measure of this chemical feedback is the sensitivity calcu-
lated here, dln[L-CH4]/dln[CH4] (percentage per percent-
age). These sensitivities, for all ATom-1 10 s parcels includ-
ing continental data, are plotted vs. L-CH4 as small black
dots in Fig. 69. The basin-mean values are shown for the Pa-
ciÔ¨Åc (large red dot, 0.76 % per percentage) and the Atlantic
(large blue dot, 0.80 % per percentage). The number we want
