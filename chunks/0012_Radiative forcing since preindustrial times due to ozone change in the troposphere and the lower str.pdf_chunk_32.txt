available climatology for multi-model evaluations focusing
ozone in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere on a
global scale.
Zonal-mean ozone distributions along with the relative de-
viations for each model are displayed in Fig. 1. For the year
2000 simulation the models were allowed to use their own,
well-tested, emissions.
This approach allows for a better
judgment of the current uncertainty within the model com-
munity. The ozone mixing ratio modeled for the year 2000
