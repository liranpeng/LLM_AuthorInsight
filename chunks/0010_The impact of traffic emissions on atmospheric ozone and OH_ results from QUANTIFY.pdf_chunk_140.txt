belts. The correlations show that the sensitivity of OH to
NOx perturbations is much higher for ship trafﬁc than for
road emissions even under low-NOx conditions. As expected
the 1OH/1 NOx-ratio is highest for ship emissions in the
relatively pristine maritime conditions in the tropics (red).
The impact of road emissions is insigniﬁcant in these regions
under low-NOx conditions. In particular in the southern ex-
tratropics (green dots) there is a high sensitivity to NOx per-
