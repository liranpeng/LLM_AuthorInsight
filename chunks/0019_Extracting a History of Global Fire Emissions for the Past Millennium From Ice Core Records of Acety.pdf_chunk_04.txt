temporal trends in ﬁre inferred from the trace gases are in reasonable agreement, with a large decline
in biomass burning emissions from the Medieval Period (MP: 1000–1500 CE) to the Little Ice Age
(LIA: 1650–1750 CE). However, the three trace gas ice core records do not yield a consistent ﬁre history, even
assuming dramatic (and unrealistic) changes in the spatial distribution of ﬁre and biomes. Substantial
