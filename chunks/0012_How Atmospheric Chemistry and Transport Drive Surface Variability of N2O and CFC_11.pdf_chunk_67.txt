changes, but the GMI model used full chemistry that did. A simple linear trend fit shows that MLS and UCI 
agree in overall trend, while LMDz5 and GMI are different, but we find little statistical significance in these 
differences given the short length of the record.
Solar cycle variations in the UV-flux change N2O photolysis directly, in addition to changing O3. The so-
lar-cycle driven O3 changes in the upper stratosphere are small over the MLS period, estimated to be +1%
