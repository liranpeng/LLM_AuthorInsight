brog et al. (2014) and Samset and Myhre (2015). The spa-
tial distribution of the mean multi-model total aerosol forcing
from aerosol changes over the 1990–2015 period is shown in
Fig. 6c. The positive forcing dominates over most regions
from a general reduction in the aerosol abundance, reaching
a maximum of 4.0 W m−2 over Europe. Over southern and
eastern Asia aerosol increases over the 1990–2015 period led
to a negative forcing of −3.0 W m−2.
