struction of air pollutants and short-lived greenhouse gases.
The NASA Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom, 2017;
Wofsy et al., 2018), in its charge to measure the chemical re-
activity over the remote ocean basins, has measured J values
while proﬁling the troposphere (0–12 km). These measure-
ments reveal a statistical pattern of J values over different
geographic, altitude and cloud regimes, which directly chal-
lenges current atmospheric chemistry models and provides
