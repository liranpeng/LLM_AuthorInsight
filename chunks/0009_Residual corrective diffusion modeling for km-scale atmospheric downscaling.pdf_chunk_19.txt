channel individually, we train separate RFs for each output channel.
Skill
When comparing the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)
of CorrDiff with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the UNet and
the other baselines, CorrDiff exhibits the most skill, followed by the
UNet, the random forest (RF) and the interpolation of ERA5
(TableÂ 1). The slight degradation in MAE of CorrDiff compared to
that of the UNet is expected, as the diffusion model optimizes the
