Global OH
Figure 4 shows the zonal mean perturbations of the hydroxyl
radical (OH) in 2050 A1B for 5 % perturbations of each of
the three transport sectors. In the troposphere, OH is the main
oxidant and changes in its concentrations are particularly rel-
evant for this study through the reaction with CH4 and sub-
sequent consequences for the radiative forcing budget. Due
