to upper tropical troposphere in the tropics and the north-
ern mid-latitudes (Fig. 2). In contrast, there is a narrow re-
gion of increases in CO-tracer mixing ratios of up to 6 ppb
(∼10 %) at ∼5–10◦N reaching from the surface to the mid-
troposphere (and into the upper troposphere in CMAM). This
feature is also seen in the annual-mean CO-tracer distribu-
tions for the four CCMs (not shown). Fang et al. (2011) also
ﬁnd substantial decreases in annual-mean CO-tracer concen-
