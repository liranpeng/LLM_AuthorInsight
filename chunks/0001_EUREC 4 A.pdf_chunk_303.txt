entist. Kraken was deployed on 25 January at 10◦08′ 45′′ N,
57◦29′ 37′′ W and was recovered on 13 February 2020 at
10◦19′ 24′′ N, 57◦53′ 30′′ W. It accomplished 472 proﬁles
down to 700 m across two different mesoscale eddies, both
anticyclonic: a North Brazil Current ring limited to the upper
150 m of depth and a thicker subsurface (200–600 m) eddy.
