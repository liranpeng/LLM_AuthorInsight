the version 6 thermal infrared (TIR) level 3 product (Deeter
et al., 2014). The MOPITT TIR averaging kernels show high
sensitivity to CO between 700 and 500 hPa (Emmons et al.,
2007). We use the CO column and 700 hPa CO retrievals.
The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) (Waters et al.,
2006), which ï¬‚ies on the Aura satellite, provides useful ob-
servations of CO down to 215 hPa (Livesey et al., 2008) be-
ginning in 2004. We use the version 4.2 level 2 data for the
