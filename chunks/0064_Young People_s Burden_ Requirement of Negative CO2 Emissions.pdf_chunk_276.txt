et al., 2015) it is nearly inevitable that N2O will continue to

There can be no expectation of an N2O decline that offsets
the need to reduce CO2.
The Montreal Protocol has stiﬂed and even reversed
growth of speciﬁc trace gases that destroy stratospheric
ozone and cause global warming (Prather et al., 1996; New-
