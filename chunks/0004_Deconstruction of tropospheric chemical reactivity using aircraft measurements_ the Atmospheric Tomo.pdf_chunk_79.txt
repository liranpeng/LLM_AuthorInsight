contain highly reactive HOx–VOC chemistry but little NOx,
and these are associated with continental outﬂow (see the dis-
cussion in G2023). The tropical Atlantic, in contrast to the
central Paciﬁc, shows large 20–30◦wide tropical regions be-
low 8 km with L-O3 > 4 ppb d−1, L-CH4 > 1.5 ppb d−1, and
L-CO > 4 ppb d−1. These regions follow the sun, northward
in ATom-14 and southward in ATom-23. For L-O3 and L-
CO, the tropical Atlantic has 50 % greater loss than the cen-
tral Paciﬁc.
