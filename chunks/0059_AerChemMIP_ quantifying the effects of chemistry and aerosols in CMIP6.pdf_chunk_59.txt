speciﬁed perturbation experiment. The comparison of each
simulation with the CMIP DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation
and Characterization of Klima) pre-industrial control experi-
ment (Eyring et al., 2016a) will enable a quantiﬁcation of the
importance of the considered climate–emission feedbacks.

Experimental design
The AerChemMIP experiments focus primarily on under-
standing atmospheric composition changes (from NTCFs
and other chemically active anthropogenic gases) and their
