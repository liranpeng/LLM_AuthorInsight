Since the MF model aggregates two datasets of different fi-
delity levels and therefore with different distribution supports,
a choice regarding the data normalization for the MF model
has to be made. On one hand, the MF model is designed
to tackle the task of extrapolation beyond the high-fidelity
training data. If the latter is chosen for data normalization,
then the MF model would be required to make predictions
for high-fidelity testing data points, while mapping them with
