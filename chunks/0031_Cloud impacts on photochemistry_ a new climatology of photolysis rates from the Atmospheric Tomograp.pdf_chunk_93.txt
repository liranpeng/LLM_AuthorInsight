Model difﬁculties and development
The J-value statistics here depend on (i) the cloud ﬁelds used
in the models, (ii) the treatment of cloud overlap statistics,
(iii) the radiative transfer methods used, and (iv) the spectral
data on sunlight and molecular cross sections. These compo-
nents are deeply interwoven in each model, and it is nearly
impossible to have the models adopt different components
except for (iv), for which there has been a long-standing ef-
