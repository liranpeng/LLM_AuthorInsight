3. Methods
Here we describe the use of models to infer the biomass burning required
to account for previously published ice core measurements of ethane
(Nicewonger et al., 2018), acetylene (Nicewonger et al., 2020) and methane and δ13CH4 (Bock et al., 2017;
Ferretti et al., 2005; MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Mischler et al., 2009; Mitchell et al., 2011;
Sowers, 2010). For the short‐lived gases, ethane and acetylene, a 3‐D chemistry transport model was used
