the trajectory data for the 59 mobile platforms deployed
during EUREC4A. Trajectories are described by the latitude
and longitude (and altitude or depth as applicable) of each
platform as a function of time. Airborne platforms are seg-
mented by ﬂight. The data are freely available on the AERIS
archive (https://doi.org/10.25326/165, Stevens, 2021). The
