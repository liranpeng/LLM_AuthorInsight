imbalance is 0.95 W m−2, which is reasonably consistent
with the observed 0.75 ± 0.25 W m−2. If we instead take
the aerosol + surface albedo forcing as −1.5 W m−2, as es-
timated by Hansen et al. (2005), the net climate forcing is
2.2 W m−2 and the forcing not responded to is 0.65 W m−2,
which is also within the observational error of Earth’s energy
imbalance.
