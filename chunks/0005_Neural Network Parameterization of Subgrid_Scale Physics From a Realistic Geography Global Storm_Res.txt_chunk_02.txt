Parameterization of subgrid‐scale processes is a major source of uncertainty in global atmospheric model simulations. Global storm‐resolving simulations use a finer grid (less than 5 km) to reduce this uncertainty by explicitly resolving deep convection and details of orography. This study uses machine learning to replace the physical parameterizations of heating and moistening rates, but not wind tendencies, in a coarse‐grid (200 km) global atmosphere model, using training data obtained by
