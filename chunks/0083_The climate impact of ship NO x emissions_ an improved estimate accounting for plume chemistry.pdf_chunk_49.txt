in two general ways: directly by recycling HO2 and RO2 back
to OH, which increases the OH / HO2 ratio and reduces the
HOx sink via HO2 self reaction; and indirectly by increas-
ing O3, which is a primary source of OH through photolysis
in the presence of water vapor. We deﬁne a time-averaged
CH4 oxidation efﬁciency (MOE) similar to OPE above, as
1L(CH4)/1L(NOx). The MOE is 0.42 in the ﬁrst 5 h of
plume aging, as calculated by the parametric plume chem-
