tions, and thus adopting these reduced-bin parameterizations
will introduce new errors, but further research will be needed
to determine whether these errors maybe an acceptable trade-
off for speed gain.
Many of these other parameterizations (e.g., Chou, 1992)
are based only on water vapor and do not include the other
trace gases that are represented in RRTMG-SW: O2 in the
visible and infrared, CH4, and CO2. These gases add to the
complexity of the RRTM-SW model, and thus we investigate
