will hence serve multiple purposes.
Of particular importance are variables as assembled in the
framework of the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) and
observations for Model Intercomparison Projects (obs4MIP)
(Teixeira et al., 2014; Ferraro et al., 2015). In addition, other
datasets such as from the SPARC Data Initiative (Hegglin et
al., 2017) for the stratosphere and from the ESA CCI (Holl-
mann et al., 2013) for the troposphere will be valuable for
