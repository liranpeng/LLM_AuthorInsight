timate variability in the southern latitudes. There is no clear
separation of O3v2 and O3v1 with this metric. The decadal
variability of this QBO-like interannual variability is seen for
different periods of the same model that differ by up to 20 %
in SD. We cannot expect agreement with observations for a
climate simulation to be better, and thus both O3v1 and O3v2
can be considered a match. The large pre-OMI to post-OMI
shift in UCI SDs may be caused by the ECMWF data as-
