The seasonal differences in CO-tracer mixing ratios in the
tropics reﬂect the combined inﬂuence of seasonal differences
in biomass burning emissions and in tropical convection. In
particular, during winter, when the ITCZ is located in the
Southern Hemisphere, the largest emissions from biomass
burning originate over Africa near the Equator (Fig. 1). In
contrast, during summer, when the ITCZ is located north
of the Equator, the peak biomass burning emissions are lo-
