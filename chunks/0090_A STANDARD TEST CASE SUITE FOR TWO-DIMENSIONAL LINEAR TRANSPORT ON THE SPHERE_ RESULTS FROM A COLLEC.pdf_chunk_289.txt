bxj = x(bαj,trm), and bφj = φ(bαj,0) the scalar value. To de-
termine bαj, the panel of the distorted mesh containing bxj is
located and bαj is computed from the data in that panel by lin-
ear interpolation. Results reported here remesh every 20 time
steps. The scheme is under development, and further details
will be reported in Bosler (2013).
