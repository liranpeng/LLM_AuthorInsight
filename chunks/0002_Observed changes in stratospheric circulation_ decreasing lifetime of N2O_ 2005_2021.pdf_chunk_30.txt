+12.0 ± 2.3 %/decade near the top (4.6 hPa). These increases
are used directly in our calculation and average to the
+6 %/decade needed to explain the trend in total N2O loss.
Are these increases in N2O real or an artifact of a known
calibration drift in the MLS 190 GHz observations, affecting
mainly water vapor and N2O? The MLS V5 dataset beneﬁts
from an extensive effort to remove/reduce drifts and verify
the MLS H2O and N2O against the overlapping ACE-FTS
