percentages on the right side of the Likert bar plots correspond to the
proportion of responses that were ranked "agree" or "strongly agree".
The percentages on the left correspond to those ranked "disagree" or
"strongly disagree", and the middle grey percentages to "neutral". Where
responses are labelled as "missing", this relates to respondents selecting
that they "cannot comment in [their] role", all questions mandated a
response.
