and longitude chosen as close as possible but maintaining a
unique cell for each parcel. ATom parcels in adjacent grid
cells may represent air masses separated by a few km instead
of the grid-cell size of order 100 km. A high density of ATom
parcels in a region will be placed in the correct latitude and
pressure cells but may be strung out in longitude cells. The
parcel will use the mole fraction of key species, water va-
por (q) and temperature (T ) as measured, but will adopt the
