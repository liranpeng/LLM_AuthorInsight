cluded all anthropogenic and natural emissions while in the
perturbation simulations, all emitted species of the respec-
tive trafÔ¨Åc sector were reduced by 5 % in accordance with
the QUANTIFY methodology (Hoor et al., 2009; Grewe et
al., 2010). It should be noted that the approach of deriving
the sensitivity of the atmospheric chemical composition to
each emission category by using a small perturbation has
limitations in the calculation of contributions, but is suitable
