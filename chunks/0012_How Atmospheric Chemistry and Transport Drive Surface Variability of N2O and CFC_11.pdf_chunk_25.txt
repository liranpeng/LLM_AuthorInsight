2.1.  The MLS Record of N2O Loss
Since mid-2004, the MLS instrument aboard the Earth Observing System Aura satellite has provided relia-
ble measurements of trace gases throughout the stratosphere and upper troposphere. Employing the meth-
od established in Prather et al. (2015) (henceforth P2015), we adopt MLS profiles and expand the calculation 
of N2O loss from 2005–2010 to 2005–2018. This work uses coincident monthly mean profiles of N2O, O3, and
