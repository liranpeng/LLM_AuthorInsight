for computing diagnostics (and tendencies from the physi-
cal parameterizations). Coupling between tracer mass and air
mass is trivial since the scheme retains Lagrangian volumes
for tracer mass and air mass throughout the integration.

Hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian
An alternative approach is to retain both a fully Lagrangian
and Eulerian representation of all prognostic variables as
done in the hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian (HEL) scheme
