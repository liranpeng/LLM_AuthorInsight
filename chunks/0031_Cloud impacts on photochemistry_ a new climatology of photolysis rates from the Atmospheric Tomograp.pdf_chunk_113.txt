ation, increasing from 0.048 at 20◦to 0.068 at 50◦(380 nm).
Rayleigh scattered light has on average larger incident angles
than the solar beam for CAFS measurements and is reﬂected
more than the direct beam. Rayleigh scattering is much more
important for J-O1D than J-NO2.
The UCI stand-alone photolysis model was rewritten to
include a lower boundary albedo that varies with angle
of incident radiation, and is now designated Cloud-J ver-
