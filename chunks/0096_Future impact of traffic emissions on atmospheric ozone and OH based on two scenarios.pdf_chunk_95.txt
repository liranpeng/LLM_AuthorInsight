terms for AIR nearly cancel out for the two most optimistic
emission scenarios (B1 and B1 ACARE) in 2050, and even
yield a slightly negative net impact for the mitigation sce-
nario (Fig. 5, bottom). On the other hand, the highest emis-
sion scenario (A1B) yields net RF due to AIR of 12 (± 11)
mW m−2, almost twice the impact in 2000. For SHIP, the
impact on net RF is negative in 2000, and its absolute impact
will increase in the future for both the A1B and B1 scenar-
