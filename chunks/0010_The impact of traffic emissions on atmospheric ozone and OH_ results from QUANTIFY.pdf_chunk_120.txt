a pronounced seasonal cycle in particular in the northern
hemisphere. The maximum effect occurs during northern
summer in the continental boundary layer between 800–
900 hPa reaching 5·103 molecules/cm3 or about 0.18%
(zonal annual mean). Since road emissions are largely emit-
ted in polluted industrialized regions over the continents the
zonal mean effect on OH at 1000 hPa is less pronounced than
at 900 hPa. High NOx-levels make OH less sensitive to per-
