their rms errors in heating.
All of these standard features of Solar-J (eight streams,
spherical geometry, cloud quadrature) increase the computa-
tional cost, but one can argue that the improved Ô¨Ådelity in
the solar heating of the atmosphere and radiative forcing of
the climate is worth the cost. The question is what fraction of
the total computational cost of a climate simulation would be
used by Solar-J. If we estimate the fractional cost of RRTMG
