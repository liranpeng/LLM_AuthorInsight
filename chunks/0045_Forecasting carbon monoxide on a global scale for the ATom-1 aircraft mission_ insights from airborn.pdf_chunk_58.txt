CO with 5 min binning is r = 0.69. Correlations for the Pa-
ciﬁc, Atlantic, and North America are 0.72, 0.80, and 0.80,
respectively, while the correlation for the Southern Ocean is
0.053. The poor correlation for the Southern Ocean reﬂects
the very low variability of CO in this region. The model per-
forms far better at capturing the larger gradients present in
the other regions. In general, the good agreement between
model outputs and observations attests to the model forecast-
