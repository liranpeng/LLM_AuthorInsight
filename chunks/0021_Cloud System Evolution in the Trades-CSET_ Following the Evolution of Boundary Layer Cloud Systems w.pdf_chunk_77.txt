trajectories would be in the range of the GV on the return flight two days later. On the basis 
of this process, the initial points to be sampled were selected and the endpoints were set as 
tentative sampling areas for the return flight. These flight plans were then shared with the 
GV pilots who would assess the feasibility of the proposed flights and would suggest any 
modifications needed to make the planned flights achievable.
