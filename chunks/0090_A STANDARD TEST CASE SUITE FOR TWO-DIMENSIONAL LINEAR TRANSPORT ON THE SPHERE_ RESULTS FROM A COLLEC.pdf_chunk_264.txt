Takahashi et al., 2006). At resolutions 1λ = 3.0◦,1.5◦,0.75◦
and 0.30◦, the time step is 1t = 900 s, 450 s, 225 s and 90 s,
respectively.
The idealized test cases are implemented in CAM-SE us-
ing the offline_dyn option. In that conﬁguration the
winds are constant throughout the Runge–Kutta time step-
ping and not updated at every stage (as is done in HOMME).

CCSRG
CCSRG is implemented on a latitude–longitude reduced
grid. The presented CCSRG results are obtained on the grids
