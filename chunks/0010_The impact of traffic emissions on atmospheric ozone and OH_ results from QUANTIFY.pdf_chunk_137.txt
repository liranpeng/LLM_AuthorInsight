(comp. Fig. 1 and Eyring et al. (2007), their Fig. 1). This
explains the stronger effect on CH4 lifetime, since a larger
fraction of NOx is emitted over the tropical oceans over a
widespread area. Recall that conditions for OH production
are favourable at low latitudes and in addition the local CH4
