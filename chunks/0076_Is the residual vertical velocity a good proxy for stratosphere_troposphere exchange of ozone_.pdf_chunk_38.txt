(black dashed). The proximity of the e90-tropopause to the 2 PVU potential vorticity is in general within the
vertical resolution of the model (1â€“2 km) except in the southern high latitudes where 2 PVU is consistently
lower than the e90-tropopause due to the extremely cold air over Antarctica.
In January (Figure 1a), high O3 mixing ratios in NH extratropics are transported downward but the pathway
