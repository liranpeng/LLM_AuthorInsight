for future decades means that their inﬂuence on atmospheric
composition could diminish (Kofﬁet al., 2010). However, there is
the possibility that the estimated reductions in RTE are not
attained,
resulting
in
a
so-called
‘policy-failure’
scenario
(A1B_HIGH). Given the ubiquitous use of road transport in many
world regions such a ‘policy-failure’ has the potential to prolong the
time-scale needed in achieving air quality targets, which have been
legislated for in future decades.
