middle panel) emission scenarios. The difference between scenarios is given in the top right panel. Also shown are the regional trends in NOx emissions from shipping (bottom left
panel), aircraft (bottom middle panel) and the NTS (bottom right panel). The aircraft NOx emissions are scaled up by a factor of 5 for clarity. Key to world regions shown: Europe
(dashed), the USA (solid), Asia (dash-dot), the Middle East (grey line), South America (dotted) and Africa (long dash).
