have no sub-bins. The transition bin S18 combines Cloud-
J’s uniform treatment of Chappuis-band O3 absorption with
four small non-overlapping sub-bins (17.5 out of a total of
608.7 W m−2) to include RRTMG’s H2O and O2 absorptions
from their bins B24–B25. These four sub-bins have strong
cross sections with their own distinct optical depth struc-
tures, and they do not overlap with the major O3 absorp-
tion in bin S18. The rest of the non-ozone sub-bins (weak
