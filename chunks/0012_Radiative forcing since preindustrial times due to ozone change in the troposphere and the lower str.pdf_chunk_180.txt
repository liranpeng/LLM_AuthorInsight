tain, but globally averaged it is slightly negative in most of
the models including stratospheric chemistry. The inclusion
of climate change leads to a further increase in radiative forc-
ing due to tropospheric ozone change.
A striking result is that the net (troposphere plus strato-
sphere) ozone change is of opposite sign to the net (tropo-
sphere plus stratosphere) forcing for all models and cases
considered here. The net ozone change is negative because
