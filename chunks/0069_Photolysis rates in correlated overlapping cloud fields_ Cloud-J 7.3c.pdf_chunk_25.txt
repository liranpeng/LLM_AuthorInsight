columns â€“ one with clouds in both layers (f G1
1
= 15 %) and
one with a cloud only in the upper layer L2 (f G1
2
= 5 %). For
a MAX group, there can be several ICAs with cloud frac-
tions, each with a unique combination of cloudy layers. The
clear-sky column does not occur if any of the MAX layers
has a cloud fraction of 100 %. For continuous cloud fractions,
the number of ICAs equals the number of unique cloud frac-
tions present (plus 1 if clear sky is present).
