stream, each model calculates reactivities using the same
chemical initialization but beginning with 5 different days in
August: 1, 6, 11, 16, and 21. This 5-day variance gives us a
measure of the uncertainty due to cloud variability, is similar
across models, and thus provides a lower limit on the detec-
tion of model–model differences, i.e., a measure of “as good
as it gets” in this comparison.
Several uncertainties are not answered with the standard
