method, because it allows the spatial distribution of STE to be accurately diagnosed. Thus, the inï¬‚uence
of changing STE on regional air quality can also be accessed. Use of the lowermost stratospheric O3
budget is limited to diagnose broad hemispheric quantities, perhaps the radiative forcing. It is more readily
applied to observed measurements if the monthly variation of the LMS can also be accurately tracked. At
