Model simulations provide a valuable tool for interpreting
these measurements and understanding the origin of the ob-
served trace gases and aerosols, so it is important to quan-
tify model performance. Goddard Earth Observing System
Model version 5 (GEOS-5) forecasts and analyses show con-
siderable skill in predicting and simulating the CO distribu-
tion and the timing of CO enhancements observed during
the ATom-1 aircraft mission. We use GEOS-5â€™s tagged trac-
