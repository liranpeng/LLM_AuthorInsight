(Fig. 10). The lidar–radar synergy will provide, for each
ATR box, the cloud fraction and the distribution of cloud
geometric and optical properties at cloud base. The second,
vertically pointing ATR cloud radar allows a characteriza-
tion of the aspect ratio of clouds, which may help infer the
mesoscale circulations within the cloud ﬁeld. These mea-
surements, associated with new methods developed to es-
timate the cloud-base mass ﬂux (Vogel et al., 2020), and
