be constructed from a library of deterministic hindcasts. This allows the first parameter‐free intercomparison of leading AI weather models' probabilistic skill against an operational baseline. Lagged ensembles of the two leading AI weather models, GraphCast and Pangu, perform similarly even though the former outperforms the latter in deterministic scoring. These results are elaborated upon by sensitivity tests showing that commonly used multiple time‐step loss functions damage ensemble
