Deterministic neural network
In addition to the SF-HF model, we also considered, for refer-
ence, a deterministic model defined as a single fully-connected
neural network with the same hyperparameters as the SF-HF
modelâ€™s individual neural networks. Both deterministic and
SF-HF-RPN models were trained on the SPCAM5 HF his-
torical run data providing a baseline for high-fidelity models
trained only on historical data.
