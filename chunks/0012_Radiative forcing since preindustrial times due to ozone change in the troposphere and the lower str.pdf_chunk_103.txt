Table 4. Annually averaged total ozone change for the differences “2 minus 1” (effect of both chemical and climate change), “2 minus 1c”
(effect of chemical change only), and “2 minus 1a” (effect of chemical change in the stratosphere only). For LMDzINCA, UM CAM, and
STOCHEM HadAM3 “2 minus 1b” is shown instead of “2 minus 1c”, since these models do not include stratospheric chemistry schemes.
Related to model setup, not all the models could perform all experiments.
