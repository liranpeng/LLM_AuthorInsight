summertime of w5 ppb (10%). Thus, these simulations show that,
although there are improvements in the peak O3 levels during
boreal summertime similar to other multi-model studies (e.g.
Collette et al., 2012), an additional consequence of mitigating NOx
emissions is a degradation in air quality in terms of near-surface O3
during boreal wintertime. In part this is due to the convective
venting of the boundary layer being much weaker at the northern
