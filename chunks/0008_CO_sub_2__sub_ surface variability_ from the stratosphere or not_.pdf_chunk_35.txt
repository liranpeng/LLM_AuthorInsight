pect minimal contribution of the QBO–driven circulation to
the CO2 IAV and ﬁnd no obvious connection between the two
in this ﬁgure. For the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO),
this simple comparison is inadequate. At best it shows that
some of the larger positive SH IAVs align with El Niños,
whereas I know that ENSO affects ocean upwelling and con-
tinental rainfall, and the CO2 anomalies correlate very well
with tropical ocean temperatures (Wang et al., 2021; Keeling
and Graven, 2021).
