When reactivity weighted, new features are found. Note that
the area under the AIR-weighted curve is the same for all
models, but the area in reactivity-weighted 1-D plots is each
model’s total reactivity (moles day−1). Model D has lower
values overall for L-CH4 compared with the other models,
but it is similar or even slightly higher for L-O3 and P-
O3. The high-O3 abundances in A remain equally impor-
tant when weighted by any reactivity, but those in B be-
