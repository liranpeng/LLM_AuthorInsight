such patterns.
For quantifying the sub-cloud layer budgets, as for many
other questions, a limiting factor has been an inability to
measure mesoscale variability in the vertical motion ﬁeld.
EUREC4A’s measurements not only address this past short
coming, but the ship-based sounding network additionally
quantiﬁes the mean vertical motion at different scales. The
arrangement of measurements, particularly ﬂight segments,
was designed to quantify the Lagrangian evolution of air
