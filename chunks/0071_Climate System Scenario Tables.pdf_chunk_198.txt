are differences relative to (minus) year 2000. The multi-model standard deviation is shown only for year 2000; it does not change much over time; and, representing primarily the spread in absolute 
O3 columns, it is larger than the standard deviation of the changes across individual models (not evaluated here). SRES values are from TAR Appendix II. CLE/MFR scenarios are from Dentener et al. 
(2005, 2006): CLE includes climate change, MFR does not. See Section 11.3.5.1.2.
