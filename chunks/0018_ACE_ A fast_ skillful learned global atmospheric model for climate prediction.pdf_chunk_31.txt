(Equations 6 and 7) reported in the title. Here, the “reference” is the physics based model (FV3GFS)
run for the same period and forced by the same SST pattern.
to be useful as a climate model, ACE must be skillful when forced by a wider variety of more realistic
SST patterns. In this section we show results of zero-shot generalization to a forcing dataset with
historical SSTs from 1990 to 2020 (using CMIP forcing data [8]). ACE is stable over the full 30-year
