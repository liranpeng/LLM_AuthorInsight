measurements to test such a wide variety of CTMs–CCMs.
Here, we consider an idealized test case for representative-
ness where we sample a model as objectively as possible and
then compare with different sampling “paths”.
One test of representativeness looks at the reactivities
sampled along a single longitude and then integrated over
latitude–pressure domains. For example, Fig. 1a clearly
shows that the instantaneous column integrated L-CH4 varies
