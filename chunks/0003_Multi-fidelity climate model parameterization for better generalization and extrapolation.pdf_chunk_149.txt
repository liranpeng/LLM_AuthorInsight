and 7.e).
Figure 8 shows the longitude-latitude structure of the R2 and MAE metrics for heat tendency at vertical levels 259, 494
and 761 hPa for all surrogate models and evaluated on the test dataset. For the R2 variation, the heat tendency results for all
pressure levels are quite similar to the results obtained for the moisture tendency, with the SF-HF-RPN model improving upon
