mixed down into the boundary layer. In the eastern Paciﬁc
and Atlantic, the full troposphere PD more closely matches
the models, including a bump in 100–300 ppt NOx which
is probably direct outﬂow from very deep convection with
lightning over the neighboring continents. Overall, the mod-
els appear to be missing signiﬁcant NOx sources in all three
regions below 4 km.
In Fig. 4, we also look at the histograms for the key HOx-
related species HOOH (third row) and HCHO (fourth row).
