5 km, 272 K, 566 hPa; and 13 km, 220 K, 177 hPa. Cur-
rently species with P interpolation include: acetaldehyde,
methylvinyl ketone, methylethyl ketone, glyoxal, methyl gly-
oxal, and one branch of acetone photolysis. Fast-J does not
extrapolate beyond its supplied tables, and thus currently it
applies 177 hPa cross sections for these VOCs throughout
the stratosphere, but this has minimal impact on stratospheric
chemistry. Depending on the available laboratory data, the
