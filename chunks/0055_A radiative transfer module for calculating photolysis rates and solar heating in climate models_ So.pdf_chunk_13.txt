we will refer to Cloud-J, not Fast-J, as the starting point of
Solar-J throughout the text. The accurate treatment of cloud
and aerosol scattering has been an essential requirement for
atmospheric chemistry modeling, and Cloud-J or alterna-
tive models (fast-TUV, Tie et al., 2003) are used standardly
in global chemistry models. Solar-J is an extension of the
Cloud-J wavelength range (0.18–0.8 µm) out to 12 µm and in-
cludes an eight-stream scattering solution for the absorption
