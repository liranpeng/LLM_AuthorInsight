OH in the atmosphere depend on other gases, most notably
methane, nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and
VOCs. All these processes are highly coupled and lead to che-
mical feedback processes10. Oxidation of methane and VOCs by
OH also provides an important atmospheric source of hydrogen.
Similarly, the change in chemistry caused by both the uptake of
OH and production of H in reaction (1) can lead to changes in
ozone. In the troposphere the production of water vapor is neg-
