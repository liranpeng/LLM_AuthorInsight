masking consistent over the period, it is based on the loca-
tion of all observing sites, effectively the largest possible QP
values over the time period. The declustering weighting for
each site, Mk, is recomputed on a daily basis.
The QP values reï¬‚ect the ability of the observing network
to predict O3; the highest (lowest) QP values have the small-
est (largest) RMSE (Fig. 2). Using this relationship and with
the intent of providing as nearly contiguous a grid for EU
