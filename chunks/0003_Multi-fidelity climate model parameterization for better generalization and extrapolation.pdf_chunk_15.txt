outperform HMC methods, variational inference techniques
and dropout as a Bayesian approximation in the context of
complex sequential decision making tasks56,61. The RPNs
improvement is mainly driven by their parallelizable imple-
mentation resulting in a significantly lower computational cost
and the possibility of building Bayesian surrogate models for
complex and large neural network architectures.
