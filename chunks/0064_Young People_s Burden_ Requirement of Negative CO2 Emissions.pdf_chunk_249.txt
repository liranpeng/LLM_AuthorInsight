CO2 as a function of emission scenario.
Oscillations of annual CO2 growth are correlated with
global temperature and with the El Niño/La Niña cycle.15
Correlations (Fig. 6) are calculated for the 12-month run-
ning means, which effectively remove the seasonal cycle
and monthly noise. Maxima of the CO2 growth rate lag
global temperature maxima by 7–8 months (Fig. 6b) and lag

perature by ∼10 months. These lags imply that the current
