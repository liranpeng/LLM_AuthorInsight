(Samset et al., 2014) and improved understanding of the im-
portance of high-resolution modelling for reproducing sur-
face BC measurements (Wang et al., 2014a) are likely to
provide more constrained BC forcing estimates in the fu-
ture. In a similar way, the aerosol–cloud interaction needs
observational constraints for reduced model spread. The re-
gional forcing of aerosol changes over the 1990–2015 period
is large, with maximum values over Europe (+4.0 W m−2)
