residual velocity is plotted in green dashed line and the exact simulated ozone ﬂuxes across the same surface in green
solid line. (j) The NH 12 month running mean ozone ﬂux in Tg/yr across e90-tropopause in black (TC-e90), and in dark
blue(LS-e90=wO3LMS@100hPa + (P −L)LMS −dM∕dtLMS). Also, in red is the ozone ﬂux into the LMS (wO3LMS@100hPa), and
in cyan, wO3LMS@100hPa + (P −L)LMS. Inclusion of the LMS tendency term dM∕dtLMS in the LMS O3 budget is crucial for
