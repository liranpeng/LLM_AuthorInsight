The stratocumulus (Sc) regimes associated with the eastern flank of the subtropical 
anticyclones evolve into fair-weather cumulus (Cu) regimes in the persistent trade winds 
associated with the anticyclones. The high albedo and large areal extent of Sc corresponds to 
a significant reduction in surface solar heating (e.g., Hartmann et al, 1992; Klein and
