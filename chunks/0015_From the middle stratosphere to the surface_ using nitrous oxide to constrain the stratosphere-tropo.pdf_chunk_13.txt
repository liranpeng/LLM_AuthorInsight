which affects climate, chemistry, and air quality, but is extremely
difficult to quantify given the large production and loss terms in the
troposphere. Here, we use other gases that are well observed and
quantified as a reference to test our simulations of ozone transport
in the atmosphere. This allows us to better constrain the
stratospheric source of ozone and also offers guidance to improve
future simulations of ozone transport.
