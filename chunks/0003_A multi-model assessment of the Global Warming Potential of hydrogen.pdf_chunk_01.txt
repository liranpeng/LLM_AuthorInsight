consequences. Hydrogen is not directly a greenhouse gas, but its chemical reactions change
the abundances of the greenhouse gases methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapor, as
well as aerosols. Here, we use a model ensemble of ﬁve global atmospheric chemistry models
to estimate the 100-year time-horizon Global Warming Potential (GWP100) of hydrogen.
We estimate a hydrogen GWP100 of 11.6 ± 2.8 (one standard deviation). The uncertainty
