parcels are in the triple-overlap area (1–10 %); but when P -
O3 parcels coincide with either L-O3 or L-CH4 parcels, they
generally lie in this triple-overlap area. The only major ex-
ception to this pattern is GISS. In terms of L-O3 and L-CH4
overlap, 4 models are very consistent (76–80 %); but GISS
is unusually low (49 %) and GFDL is unusually high (93 %).
These patterns help identify distinctly different chemistries
in these models that have been identiﬁed with other diagnos-
