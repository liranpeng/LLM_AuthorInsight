Supplementary Figure S3.  Surface F11X change (ppb/yr) composites centered on the QBO phase 
transition at 40 hPa, see Figure 3.  F11 is typically measured in mole fraction parts per trillion (ppt), but 
to directly compare with the N2OX composites and highlight the larger magnitude, we rescale surface 
F11X to a mean tropospheric abundance of 320 ppb.  Note, the scale of the F11X colorbar is twice that 
of the N2O/N2OX composites in Figure 3.
