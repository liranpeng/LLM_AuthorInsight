and reactivity speciﬁc: for L-O3, GFDL is much steeper that
the other models, consistent with the feature identiﬁed earlier
in the scatter plots; and for L-CH4, GISS is much shallower.
Surprisingly, with this diagnostic GISS is not an obvious out-
lier for P-O3 and L-O3 as seen in previous comparisons.
From this cumulative reactivity ﬁgure, one can see that
the top 5 % of parcels comprise 15 % of the total reactiv-
ity, effectively a slope of 3 : 1. With the exceptions noted,
