out with the most unusual chemistry patterns and sometimes
illogical correlations. Efforts by a co-author to clarify the
GISS results or identify errors in the implementation have not
been successful. GISS results are included here for complete-
ness in the set of three papers but are not reconciled. Overall,
three models showed remarkable inter-model agreement in
the three Rs with less than half of the RMSD (root-mean-
square difference) as compared with the other models. UCI
