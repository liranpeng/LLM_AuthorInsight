dln[R]/dln[T ] should be multiplied by 10 to get the percentage per percentage. Sensitivities that would round to |S| > 0.1 are shown in
bold. The average sensitivity over the basin is calculated here from (a) the single basin-wide average of R. Alternative but less desirable
methods would average the individual parcel S values weighted by (b) frequency of occurrence and the R value or (c) just frequency of
