especially over the tropics and northern mid-latitudes. Un-
derlying these changes there is a strong seasonality in trans-
port patterns between winter and summer, with higher CO-
tracer mixing ratios aloft in winter when biomass burning
emissions source regions are located along the ITCZ.
These absolute changes in CO-tracer mixing ratios due to
climate change are generally larger in boreal winter than in
summer, although relative changes are similar. The relative
