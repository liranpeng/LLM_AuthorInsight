ature of near-surface air isentropically lifted from the surface; the
slope discontinuity at the lifting condensation level (690 m) marks
the shift from an unsaturated to a saturated isentrope. The tempera-
ture difference between the sea surface and the lower atmosphere is
taken from Saildrone data.
density difference between the near-surface air and air satu-
rated at the skin temperature of the underlying ocean can be
attributed to variations in the speciﬁc humidity.
