estimates of the geologic source and Cl sink. Boreal emissions for acetylene and ethane are separated in the bottom
panels (e–h). Shaded regions reﬂect uncertainties in the emissions and the emission factors. Modern emission estimates
based on GFED4 and emission factors are shown with the colored circles.
