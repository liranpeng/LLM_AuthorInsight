per cent reductions occurred in the second decade, and this is
matched by the model simulations. Consistent with the Eu-
ropean record, the observations are −0.2 % yr−1 more neg-
ative than models over either period. Thus, our simulation
appears to slightly underestimate the reductions in PM2.5
over the USA and Europe. In Fig. 2b the AOD at 550 nm
is shown as model mean trend in absolute AOD, similar to
PM2.5 in Fig. 2a. Maximum reduction in AOD is 0.30 (abso-
