with GEOS-5 underestimating the observed gradient. Both
the model and measurements show tropospheric CO less
than 90 ppbv along the ﬂight route with slightly elevated CO
above 600 hPa around 22:00 and 00:00. For this ﬂight and the
subsequent ﬂight to Punta Arenas, all observations are in the
Southern Hemisphere and the mean values for both ATom-
1 and GEOS-5 agree within the range 54–57 ppb (Table 2,
Fig. S5).
