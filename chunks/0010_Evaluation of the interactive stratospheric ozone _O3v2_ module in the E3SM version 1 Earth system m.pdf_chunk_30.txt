ditional pair of 5-year O3v2 AMIP-type simulations are car-
ried out to diagnose the climate sensitivity (following Cess et
al., 1989). One of the pair prescribes the SST and sea ice con-
centration to represent current climate conditions. The other
simulation is identical, including ﬁxed sea ice, except for in-
creasing the SST uniformly by 4 K. More details about the
E3SMv1 Cess conﬁguration are documented in Caldwell et
al. (2019).
