the major axis of variability in the model ensemble, indicat-
ing global (not ship) inventory differences could contribute
substantially to the ensemble spread presumably by generat-
ing background atmospheres with different levels of NOx and
HOx precursors. The CMIP5 inventory prescribes more CO
emissions (610 vs. 580 Tg(CO) yr−1) and slightly less NOx
emissions (27.2 vs. 27.6 Tg(N) yr−1) with large changes in
their spatial distributions. These emission differences tend to
