the surface fluctuations (Corazza et al., 2010; Ray et al., 2020; Thompson et al., 2011). The most extensive 
of such studies (Thompson, Chevallier, et al., 2014; Thompson, Ishijima, et al., 2014) continues to admit 
“errors in stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE) represent an important source of model error.” Here, 
we use a much wider range of stratospheric and surface measurements, along with models specific to the
