grate for 24 h as it normally does in a way that the chemistry
in each grid cell depends minimally on any of the grid cells
around it.
We thus propose an A-run mode (named after the ATom
mission) for the CTMs–CCMs in which individual parcel
reactivities can be calculated, albeit with some simplifying
approximations. Consistent with our deﬁnition of reactivity,
we consider only ATom parcels that are tropospheric. The
A-runs disable processes that connect and mix air parcels.
