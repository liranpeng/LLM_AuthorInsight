increases from the effects of other GHG emissions. This hypoth-
esis was previously considered (Grooss and Mueller, 2011) and
found inconclusive, based on the correlational rather than cause-
and-effect analysis of Lu (2013a). Online critiques of this pub-
lication elaborate on its limitations (ClimateNexus, 2013;
Lu, 2013b).
Today, all HFCs are responsible for about 0.6% of the total
radiative forcing from GHGs, which is increasing at >1%/year
