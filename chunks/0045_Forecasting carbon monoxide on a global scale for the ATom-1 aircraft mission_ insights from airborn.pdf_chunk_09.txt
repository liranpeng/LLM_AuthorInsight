emission types that contribute to the trace gas and aerosol
concentrations measured during ATom, which is directly rel-
evant to the goal of quantifying how anthropogenic emissions
affect global chemical reactivity. GEOS-5 supports numer-
ous aircraft missions, and validation of the model forecasts
is important for developing conÔ¨Ådence in and understanding
the limitations of chemistry forecasting for aircraft missions.
The ATom dataset, which uses unbiased sampling rather than
