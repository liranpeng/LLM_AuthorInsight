if the variation in J values is driving the reactivities. Two
models (GISS, NCAR) have 12 %–17 % σ(Js), which might
be explained by more opaque clouds, but the ampliﬁed σ(R)
values (14 %–32 %) are inexplicable. This discrepancy needs
to be resolved before using these two models for ATom RDS
analysis.
