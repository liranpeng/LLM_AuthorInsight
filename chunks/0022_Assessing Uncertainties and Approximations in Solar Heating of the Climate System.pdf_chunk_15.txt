in one code is obvious as both solutions use the same atmospheric data and we move to ESMs that require 
both. Nevertheless, compromises between the two requirements, Watts versus photons sâˆ’1, are identified 
here.
In this study, we examine additional classes of approximations or uncertainties beyond P2019: examples of 
the historical improvement in infrared heating codes and the ongoing work at major climate centers (Sec-
