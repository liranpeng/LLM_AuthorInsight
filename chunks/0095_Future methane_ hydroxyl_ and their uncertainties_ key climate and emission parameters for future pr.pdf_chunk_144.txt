a CTM or GCM, the advantage is that it can be rapidly ap-
plied to many climate data sets or socioeconomic scenarios.
Using the parametric model to reconstruct methane life-
time for 1980–2005, we estimate 2.2±1.8 % decrease in
τCH4×OH, in contrast to previous parametric approaches that
suggested increases or no change. Our decrease is the same
direction of change as previous CTM studies and consistent
with methyl chloroform observations, but smaller in magni-
