That said, a scheme may still exhibit non-shape-preserving
behavior inside the range of the initial conditions that will
not be accounted for in ℓo but rather in ℓu. As expected, all
unlimited versions of the schemes show overshooting mix-
ing of varying amounts. For all the ﬁnite-volume schemes,
the scatter points in the overshooting mixing category seem
to gather around the extension of the straight line making up
the lower boundary of the convex hull, almost as an exten-
