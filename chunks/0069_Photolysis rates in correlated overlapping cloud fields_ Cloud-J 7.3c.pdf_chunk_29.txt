N2 + 1 ICAs above in group G2. The total number of ICAs
combining both groups is the product (N1 + 1)(N2 + 1), as-
suming that there are clear-sky members in both groups. The
ICA sequence deﬁning each unique pairing (J1, J2) is then
(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),...(N1 + 1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(3,2),
...(N1 + 1,N2 + 1),
(21)
such that ICA #M is composed of members
J1 = (M −1) modulo (N1 + 1) + 1,
(22)
J2 = integer ((M −1)/(N1 + 1))
modulo (N2 + 1) + 1.
