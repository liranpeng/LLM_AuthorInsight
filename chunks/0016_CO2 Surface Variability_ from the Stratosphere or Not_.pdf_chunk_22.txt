tical locations and QBO patterns in their stratospheric loss.
A species STE ﬂux pattern (i) scales with the total ﬂux out of
the stratosphere and (ii) is determined by the dynamics of the
lowermost midlatitude stratosphere (Ruiz and Prather, 2022,
Fig. 1).
The monthly CO2 surface observations are gathered from
NOAA ESRL (Dlugokencky et al., 2021b). I use ﬁve sites:
BRW – Barrow, AK (now Utqia˙gvik), at 71◦N, 156◦W;
MLO – Mauna Loa, HI, at 20◦N, 156◦W; SMO – Tutuila,
