from 0 (random) to 1 (maximal overlap), and gL1 is the inter-
polating function linear in cc between random and maximal
overlap.
gL1 = 1 + cc(1/f L2 −1),
subject to gL1 ≤1/f L1 and gL1 ≤1/f L2
(10)
Hence for cc > 0 we have an increased likelihood of the cloud
in L1 falling underneath the cloud in L2. For the example in
Fig. 1, cc = 0.5 and gL1 = 3.
wL1(#1) = gL1f L1 = 3 × 0.15 = 45%
(11)
wL1(#2) = 1 −gL1f L1 = 1 −0.45 = 55%
