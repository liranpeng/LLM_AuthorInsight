Fig. 2. Same as Fig. 1 but for schemes deﬁned on a regular latitude–longitude grid (rows 1 and 2) and icosahedral/Voronoi meshes (rows 3
and 4). Note that the LPM scheme was run with ﬁxed time step and not with ﬁxed Courant number; therefore no CN value is appended to
the LPM label. For easier comparison the y axes are identical on all optimal convergence ﬁgures.
