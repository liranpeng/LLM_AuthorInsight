mixing ratios throughout most of the troposphere, especially
in the tropics, and an increase around the tropopause is found
across the four CCMs in both winter and summer. Decreases
in CO-tracer mixing ratios in the tropical troposphere are as-
sociated with reduced convective mass ﬂuxes in this region,
which in turn may reﬂect a weaker Hadley cell circulation in
the future climate. Increases in CO-tracer mixing ratios near
the tropopause are largely attributable to a rise in tropopause
