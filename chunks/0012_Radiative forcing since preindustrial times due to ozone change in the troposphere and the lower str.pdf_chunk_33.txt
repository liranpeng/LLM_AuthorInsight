(Fig. 1a) amounts to a few tens of ppbv at the surface and
increases with altitude. In low latitudes, vertical transport
of relatively low ozone air through convection and advec-
tion deﬂects the ozone contour lines upwards. Differences
among the models are explained not only by differences in
the chemistry modules, but also in long range transport from
the main emission sources into remote areas, where ozone
production is more efﬁcient. Following the pattern of emis-
