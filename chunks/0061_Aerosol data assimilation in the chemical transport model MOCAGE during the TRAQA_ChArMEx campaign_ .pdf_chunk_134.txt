the substantial underestimation in the model, it would have a
limited impact. Another approach would be to try to deﬁne
the matrix B differently. Previous studies show that a rig-
orously deﬁned matrix B can slightly improve the analysis
quality (Kahnert, 2011; Massart et al., 2012). In MOCAGE-

of different matrices B was assessed for the case of ozone as-
