depends upon the emission location and season, with surface
anthropogenic NOx emissions generally leading to net cooling
but aircraft NOx aloft leading to small net warming.37–43
Consideration of gas–aerosol interactions suggests that global
increases in NOx emissions may exert a greater negative
forcing by enhancing sulfate burdens via increased oxidant
levels.44 The aerosol response, however, is not robust across
models27 and carbon cycle impacts from O3 exposure34 may be
