remain dominant drivers of methane lifetime throughout the
21st century, we use this parametric model to make new pro-
jections of methane abundance and its uncertainty through
2100. Finally, the perturbation tests also enable a new esti-
mate of the ozone contribution to methane radiative forcing
and global warming potential.

Model descriptions
We diagnose methane lifetime due to tropospheric OH,
τCH4×OH, from multi-year simulations in 3 different CTMs:
