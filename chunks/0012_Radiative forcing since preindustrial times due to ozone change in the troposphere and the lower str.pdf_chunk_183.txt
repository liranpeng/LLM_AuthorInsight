the tropospheric ozone increase since preindustrial times has
moderated lower stratospheric ozone depletion in low lat-
itudes, while stratospheric ozone depletion during the last
three decades has inï¬‚uenced tropospheric ozone increase in
high latitudes. In this context it will be important to further
investigate transport of ozone through the tropopause. In the
long run it should become possible to consider radiative forc-
ing from tropospheric and stratospheric changes combined.
