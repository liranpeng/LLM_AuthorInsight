with instruments working, acquiring well over 90 % of the
proposed dataset, and measuring more than 30 000 10 s air
parcels. A quick look at the pre-ATom planned ﬂight tracks
and sampling in Fig. 9 shows the coverage of the ocean
basins, the large numbers of proﬁles, and the sampling fre-
quency as a function of altitude. The expected release of
ATom-1 data is mid-2017 and will include the global chem-
ical model products discussed here. These measurements
