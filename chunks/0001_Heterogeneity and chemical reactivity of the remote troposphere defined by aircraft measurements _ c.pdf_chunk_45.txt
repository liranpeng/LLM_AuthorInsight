data (air parcels) for the key reactive species. The MDS is
based on direct observations and interpolation methods to Ô¨Åll
gaps as documented in the Supplement. Using version 0 of
the MDS, we have six chemical models calculating the 24 h
reactivities, producing a reactivity data stream (RDS version
0) using protocols noted in the Prologue (P2017) and de-
scribed further in Sect. 3.2. There, we describe the updated
modeling protocol RDS* necessary to address measurement
