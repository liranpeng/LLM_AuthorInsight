reference. This signal is expected to be globally small (com-
mensurate with a forcing of the order of 0.1 W mâˆ’2, although
much larger locally), so at least three ensemble members for
both SSP3-7 and SSP3-7-lowNTCF variants are requested
as continuation from existing historical ensemble members.
Where natural emissions are modelled interactively, these
will vary with the evolving climate and will differ between
ssp370 and ssp370-lowNTCF as the climate diverges.
