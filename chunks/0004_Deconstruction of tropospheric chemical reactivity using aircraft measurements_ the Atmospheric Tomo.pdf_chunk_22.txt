Reactivity calculations here use the UC Irvine Zhu (UCIZ)
model and the RDS* protocol described in G2023. UCIZ is
the updated UCI chemistry-transport model (CTM version
q7.4) by Xin Zhu that is adapted to calculating ATom air
parcels. The RDS∗protocol allows the peroxyacetyl nitrate
(PAN) and HNO4 species to thermally decay for 24 h before
use. The overall ATom protocol for the CTM and CCMs av-
erages 5 d, separated by 5 d centered on each deployment’s
