and the approaches to approximate the sum over ICAs, ex-
amining their errors. Another recent development in model-
ing photolysis rates is the treatment of volatile organic com-
pounds with pressure-dependent cross sections, presented in
Sect. 4. Recommendations for the cloud-overlap model and
the ICA-approximation method are discussed in Sect. 5.
