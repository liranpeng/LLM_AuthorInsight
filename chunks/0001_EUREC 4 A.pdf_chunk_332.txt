primary production), and molecular analyses (e.g., microbial community structure)
of the wind/waves and rainfall. Five barometer–temperature
drifters from Paciﬁc Gyre were deployed from R/V MS-
Merian from 21 January to 4 February 2020. Each drifter
measured temperature at 20 cm depth and barometric sea
level pressure. Each drifter had a 6 m long drogue centered
at a depth of 15 m. The drifters used Iridium SBD telemetry
and a 50-channel GPS system (including WAAS correction),
