(a mean solar ﬂux is used).
Vertically, losses are weighted linearly in pressure (mass),
and across latitude, they are weighted by the area of each lati-
tude belt. Annually integrated budgets include the number of
days in each month, but leap years are treated as 365 d years,
and thus our annual losses are biased low by 0.07 %. Life-
times are budgetary timescales and calculated as a 12-month
burden (TgN) divided by the 12-month loss (TgN yr−1). The
