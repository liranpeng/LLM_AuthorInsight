d Adopted values are the mean of CTMs, except for VOC, and aviation NOx, which come from literature. Uncertainties are 1-σ values based on CTM spread and
expert assessment of literature. Terms marked N have negligible impact on interannual τCH4×OH variability and are not used in the parametric model.
e Tropospheric perturbation only.
f In Oslo CTM3 stratospheric chemistry and stratosphere-troposphere exchange respond to the perturbation, whereas UCI CTM and GEOS-Chem responses are due
