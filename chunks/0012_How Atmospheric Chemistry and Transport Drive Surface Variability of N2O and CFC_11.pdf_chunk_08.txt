from human emissions and quantify what humans can do to reduce the growth in N2O. In this work, we 
model the physical side of atmospheric N2O that drives fluctuations through chemistry and atmospheric 
transport. Our model simulations match most of the observed seasonal and multi-year fluctuations seen in 
satellite and surface observations, indicating that N2O loss is causing the dominating signal, not emissions.
