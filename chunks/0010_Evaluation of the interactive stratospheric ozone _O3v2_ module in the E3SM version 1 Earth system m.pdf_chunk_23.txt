It has been implemented in other models such as European
Centre-based CTMs (Aschmann et al., 2009), the CESM-
CAM-Superfast climate model used in ACCMIP (Lamarque
et al., 2013), and current versions of GEOS-Chem (Murray
et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2018).
Additionally, the lower boundary sink of ozone intro-
duced by O3v2 provides a self-consistent diagnostic for the
stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE) ﬂux of ozone, a
major tropospheric ozone budget term that cannot be diag-
