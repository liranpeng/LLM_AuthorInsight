land NOx and methane feedback – have changed little since
the IPCC TAR, on which MAGICC is based. The parametric
model and MAGICC will differ in socioeconomic and cli-
mate scenarios where other emissions, ozone, or lightning
drive τCH4×OH changes.

Methane global warming potential
Global Warming Potentials (GWP) are useful for compar-
ing the radiative forcing (RF) caused by emissions of var-
ious GHGs having different absorbances and atmospheric
