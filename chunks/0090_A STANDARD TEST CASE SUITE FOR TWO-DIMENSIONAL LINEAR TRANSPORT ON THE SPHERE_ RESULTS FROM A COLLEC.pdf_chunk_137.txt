ters reduce convergence rates. The most striking reductions
in K2 are for the higher order schemes such as HOMME-p6,
HOMME-p3, and SFF-CSLAM4 for which the convergence
rates are reduced by four, two, and two, respectively. The for-
mally third-order schemes CSLAM, MPAS, SFF-CSLAM3
see reduction of convergence rates of about 0.5. Schemes
that are approximately second-order accurate are less af-
fected (in an absolute sense) by shape-preserving Ô¨Ålters. The
