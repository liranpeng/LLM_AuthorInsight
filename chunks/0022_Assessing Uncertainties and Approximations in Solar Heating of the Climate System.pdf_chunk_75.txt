framework and including ice clouds. We do not have the capability to generate correlated-k sub-bins for 
the 66 IR bands and thus cannot include infrared (IR) gas absorption. In a single column model like LZL, 
we calculate cloud heating rate profiles for sample stratus and cirrus clouds at high sun (FigureÂ 3c) using 
SJ/66b and compare it with Solar-J without IR absorption (SJ/noIR). For stratus clouds, the excess heating
