and is also evident in the water vapor Ô¨Åeld. Typically the ma-
rine boundary (sub-cloud) layer is viewed as a turbulent layer
that primarily interacts with the much-larger-scale evolution
of the free atmosphere through small-scale entrainment at its
top. Events such as the one shown in Fig. 13 suggest that in
addition to downdrafts and the cold pools they feed, circula-
tions on scales commensurate with and larger than the depth
of the sub-cloud layer may be important for boundary layer
