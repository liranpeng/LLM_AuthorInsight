Multi-fidelity Randomized Prior Networks
The multi-fidelity model is also constructed using RPNs of
size 128. Trainable and non-trainable surrogate models of
each member of the multi-fidelity RPN (MF-RPN) are built
with the architecture detailed in figure 1.b. The chosen archi-
tecture consists of two fully connected deep neural networks.
The first network (highlighted in red in figure 1) predicts the
low-fidelity parameterization output from the parameteriza-
