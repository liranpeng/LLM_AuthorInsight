protocol (UCI2∗) is shown in Tables 2 and S8 next to the
standard protocol (UCI2). The reactivities drop slightly (3 %
for P-O3, 2 % for L-O3 and 0 % for L-CH4) as expected with
less NOx, but the sensitivity of the reactivities to these com-
pounds (∂lnR/∂lnX) drops by a factor of 2 or more. We use
the UCI2∗results as our best estimate of the ATom reactivi-
ties for the ﬁgures in this paper.
