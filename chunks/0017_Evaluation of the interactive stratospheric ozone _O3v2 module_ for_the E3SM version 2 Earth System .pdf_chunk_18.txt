from the input4MIPS GHG historical data set v1.2.0. Fol-
lowing Cariolle et al. (1990), Linoz uses a parameterization
for chlorine-induced ozone depletion based on temperature
and sunlight thresholds intended to mimic chlorine activa-
tion on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) at cold tempera-
tures and the ensuing rapid photochemical loss of ozone. This
model has proven robust and reasonably accurate (Déqué
et al., 1994; McLinden et al., 2000; Eyring et al., 2013).
