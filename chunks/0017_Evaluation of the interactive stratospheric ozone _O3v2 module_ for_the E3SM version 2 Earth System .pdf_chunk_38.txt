decades appear to be driven by tropospheric ozone (Gaudel
et al., 2018). We also develop metrics based on the proﬁles
of ozone and the evolution of the Antarctic ozone hole (for
which we use total column ozone). The last ozone metric
that we would like to use is the stratosphere–troposphere ex-
change ﬂux since it is an important link between the two
ozone reservoirs. Unfortunately, we have no direct obser-
vations and rely on model–model comparisons. We should
