niques in traumatic injury rehabilitation and none looking 
at ankle fracture recovery [14].
Objectives
The primary aims of the systematic review are:
•	 To determine which behaviour change techniques (BCTs) 
have been most commonly used in studies comparing 
rehabilitation interventions after ankle fracture and deter-
mine which theories they are based on.
•	 To determine which BCTs are most effective in improv-
ing patient-reported outcomes after ankle fracture.
