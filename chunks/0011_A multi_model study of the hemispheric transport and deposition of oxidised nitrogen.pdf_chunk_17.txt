relationships are calculated using a particular background
state of the atmosphere, and that the relationships may be
sensitive to changes in atmospheric composition.
[6] In this study, a 20% decrease in anthropogenic
emissions was used, as it lies within the range of possible
future regional emission reductions [Cofala et al., 2007].
Previous results indicate that model responses to this size of
emission change are close to linear [TF HTAP, 2007].
