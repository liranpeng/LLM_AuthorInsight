tive mass ﬂuxes are simulated by the UM-CAM and STOC-
HadAM3 CCMs, but not by the other two CCMs (Figs. 6a–b
and 7a–b). The GISS-E2-R CCM depicts a small band of in-
creased convective mass ﬂuxes at the Equator extending from
the surface to the upper troposphere in winter. A strong in-
crease in convective mass ﬂuxes in the Northern Hemisphere
polar latitudes at the surface extending upwards is also a con-
sistent model feature in winter, which is most prominent in
