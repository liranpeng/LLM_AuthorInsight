predicting outputs equal to input would result in each variable contributing equally to the loss
function (similar to [11]). See Appendix H for details and Appendix I.1 for an ablation of this choice.
This “residual scaling” approach has the largest impact on the surface pressure, which ends up having
a normalized standard deviation about 20 times larger than otherwise (Figure 12).
