Methane lifetime sensitivity to chemistry-climate
factors
Having identiﬁed consistent variations in τCH4×OH across
multiple CTMs, we examine their causes with explicit per-
turbation tests. In these tests, we perturb a single climate or
emission variable, simulate 3 or more years, discard the ﬁrst
year as spinup, and analyze the difference from the unper-
turbed simulation in the remaining years. Perturbations are
