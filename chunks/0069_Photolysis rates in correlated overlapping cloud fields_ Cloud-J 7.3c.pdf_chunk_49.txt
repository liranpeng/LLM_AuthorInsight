sorted in order of increasing ICA number. The different cloud cor-
relation factors used in the G6 model do not change the number of
ICAs, only their weights. The average number of ICAs per FCA is
given in the legend. See text for deﬁnition of models.
atmospheres that represent four domains of ICAs with to-
tal cloud optical depths at 600 nm of 0–0.5 (clear sky), 0.5–
4 (cirrus-like), 4–30 (stratus-like), and > 30 (cumulus-like).
The original model sorted the ICA optical depths to get the
