96 in latitude and 144 in longitude). The vertical resolution
varies from ≈150 m to ≈5300 m. The ESM time step is 30
min and a temporal sub-sampling by a factor of 2 is performed
(to reduce the overly correlated training data), resulting in a
final training dataset of roughly 29.5 M points.
For the high-fidelity SPCAM5 testing data, the correspond-
ing temporal and spatial resolutions, model spin-up and tem-
poral sub-sampling are the same as detailed above for the
