sient ERFs. The impact of background state on the diagnosis
of ERFs is likely to be small (Forster et al., 2016). This is fur-
ther discussed in Sect. 5.1. The control simulation (histSST)
uses prescribed historical SSTs with all other components as
historical. This is not likely to be signiÔ¨Åcantly different from
the coupled-ocean historical simulation, but we request this
simulation for consistency with the rest of the experiments.
There are Tier 2 experiments to calculate separately the tran-
