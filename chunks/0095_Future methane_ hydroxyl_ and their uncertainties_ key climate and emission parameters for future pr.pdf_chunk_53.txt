0.5 pmol mol−1) in the monthly means. (See Fig. S2) While
small in absolute terms, these differences exceed the stan-
dard error in monthly means and persist for several consecu-
tive months; thus they are likely not caused by synoptic vari-
ability and differences in sampling frequency. Because the
biases change over time, they lead to differences of up to
4 % in MCF decay rates at a single site. As can be seen in
Fig. 2, both networks ﬁnd similar magnitude of OH variabil-
