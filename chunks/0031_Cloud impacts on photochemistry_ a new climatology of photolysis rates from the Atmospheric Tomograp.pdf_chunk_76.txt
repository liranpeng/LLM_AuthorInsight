servations. Thus our model statistics over a large block may
be a representative climatology of cloud effects on J values.
Further sampling tests are recommended for follow-on work,
especially to determine if the distinct eastâ€“west differences
for the three MERRA cloud models are a standard feature.

Analyzing cloud effects
With a graphical synopsis of the rlnJ probability distributions
in Fig. 5a, b, some model features become more obvious. We
