feedback factor, which was already suggested by Fiore et
al. (2009), lowers the methane radiative forcing and global
warming potential, as discussed in Sect. 6.

A parametric model for τCH4×OH
The sensitivity parameters in Table 2, together with the time
series of corresponding climate and emission variables in
Fig. 3, enable us to build a parametric model for methane
lifetime representing each CTM. We combine terms linearly,
so that τCH4×OH is approximated by
