et al., 2013; Vallis et al., 2015). The decreases in CO-tracer
mixing ratios in the tropical troposphere therefore most likely
reï¬‚ect reduced convection in the future. Reduced convection
in the tropics may also explain the dipole in CO-tracer re-
sponse that occurs near equatorial and Central Africa, since
the seasonal patterns of changes in CO-tracer concentra-
tions in the tropics are in essence determined by how sea-
sonal changes in convection project onto seasonally varying
