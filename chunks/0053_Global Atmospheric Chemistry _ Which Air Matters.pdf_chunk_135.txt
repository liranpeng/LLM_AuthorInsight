σX/σY ). The values of centroid, semimajor and semiminor
axes, and the degree of rotation are given in Tables S6 for all
plots in Fig. 6. An example showing a ﬁtted ellipse on top
of the 2-D probability distribution is given in Fig. S1, and
the ellipses for all six model distributions in Fig. 6a and b
are plotted together in Fig. S2a and b, respectively. These el-
lipses can provide a more direct and simple comparison of
the central distributions of the models and support the dis-
