of HOLODEC are that the sample volume measured per second (about 43 cm3) is not speed 
dependent and the effects produced by shattering from the aperture edges can be identified 
and eliminated. Most significantly, it is possible to measure cloud droplet size distributions 
from individual localized sample volumes with the largest dimension being 130 mm, instead 
of an average over more than 10 m (e.g. for a measurement from CDP at 10 Hz), as well as
