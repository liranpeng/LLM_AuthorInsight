mean global mean value (Fig. 2a), which is publicized at
the end of each year. However, as discussed by Hansen et
al. (2010), the 12-month running mean global temperature
is more informative and removes monthly “noise” from the
record just as well as the calendar year average. For example,
the 12-month running mean for the past 67 years (Fig. 2b)
deﬁnes clearly the super-El Niños of 1997–1998 and 2015–
2016 and the 3-year cooling after the Mount Pinatubo vol-
canic eruption in the early 1990s.
