turbed the common air we breathe. We seek knowledge of
the photochemical evolution in each air parcel to understand
the overall impact of this heterogeneity and to interpret hu-
man impact on past changes and predict future ones. The at-
mosphereâ€™s integration of this chemical reactivity over the
ensemble of such heterogeneous air masses controls the evo-
lution of air pollutants and reactive greenhouse gases, par-
ticularly methane and ozone. Hence, it allows us to evaluate
