defines the probability distributions from which the fixed non-
trainable parameters are sampled. RPNs also resort to data
bootstrapping in order to mitigate a potential uncertainty col-
lapse of the ensemble method when tested beyond the training
data points60. Data bootstrapping consists of sub-sampling
and randomization of the data on which each network in the
ensemble is trained.
