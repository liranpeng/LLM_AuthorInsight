al. (2018). All the E3SMv1 simulations in the present study
are performed with EAMv1 forced by monthly mean sea
surface temperatures (SSTs) at the standard 1◦horizontal
resolution and 72 vertical layers, extending from the sur-
face to 60 km (∼0.1 hPa) with a 600 m vertical resolution
near the tropopause (see Fig. 1 of Xie et al., 2018). The
ﬁrst EAMv1 ozone package (termed O3v1) uses a prescribed
decadal monthly mean climatology from the input4MIPS
