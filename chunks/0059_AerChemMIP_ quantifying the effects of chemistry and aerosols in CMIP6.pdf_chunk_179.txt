els. In contrast, AerChemMIP uses historical as the control
and ﬁxes one class of species at a time to pre-industrial levels
(e.g. hist-piAer).
The DAMIP hist-stratO3 run has only stratospheric ozone
evolving, using either the prescribed CMIP6 ozone dataset
(Hegglin et al., 2017) or ozone output from the previous his-
torical run. In the troposphere ozone is ﬁxed to pre-industrial
levels. The equivalent experiment for the models with strato-
