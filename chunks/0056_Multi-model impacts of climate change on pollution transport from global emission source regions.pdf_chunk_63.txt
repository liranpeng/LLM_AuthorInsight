et al., 2006). The seasonality of the CO tracer and CO is fairly
similar, with a more pronounced winter peak in the tropics in
the CO tracer in the mid-troposphere. The relative changes in
CO-tracer mixing ratios are largest in the tropics and during
winter and smaller in summer. Henceforth, the focus is on
Ô¨Åndings for boreal winter and summer.
