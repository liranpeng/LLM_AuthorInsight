statistical distribution of reactivities of all those grid cells.
We take these statistics to be equivalent to those we would
get from integrating the reactivity over isolated air parcels
with the same initialization. Of course the latter is only a
thought experiment since the parcels do not remain isolated.
In C-runs new air parcels are entering the domain and others
are exiting. In a single cell we can start with a polluted lamina
and end with clean air convected from the marine boundary
