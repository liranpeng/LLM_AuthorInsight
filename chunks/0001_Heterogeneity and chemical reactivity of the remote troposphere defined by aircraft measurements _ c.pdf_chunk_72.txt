attributed to instrument noise) were reported under condi-
tions where the thermal decomposition frequency was > 0.4
per hour in the lower troposphere (> 253 K for HNO4 and
> 291 K for PAN). Thus, these species instantly become
NOx. While these measurements are clearly spurious, there
is no easy Ô¨Åx. We developed a new protocol, RDS*, that al-
lows both species to decay for 24 h using their local thermal
decomposition rate before being used in the model. This pro-
