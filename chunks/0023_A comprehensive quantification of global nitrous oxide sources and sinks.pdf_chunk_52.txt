the upwelling regions of the equatorial Pacific, Indian and tropical 
Atlantic (Fig. 3) provide considerable sources of N2O32–34. Bottom-up 
estimates suggest that the southern ocean region is the second largest 
contributor, with emissions around twice as high as those from the 
northern oceans (53% tropical oceans, 31% southern oceans, 17% north-
ern oceans), in line with their respective areas. Top-down estimates, 
however, suggest approximately equal contributions from the southern
