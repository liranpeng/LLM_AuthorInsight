and so we also examine the PDs of the tropical reactivities
(Fig. 5). The model PDs (colored lines connecting open cir-
cles at the center of each bin) are calculated from the 1 d
statistics for mid-August (P2017) using the model blocks
shown in Fig. S1. The model grid cells are weighted by air
mass and cosine(latitude) and limited to pressures greater
than 200 HPa. The ATom PDs (black lines connecting black
open circles) are calculated from the 10 s data weighted by
