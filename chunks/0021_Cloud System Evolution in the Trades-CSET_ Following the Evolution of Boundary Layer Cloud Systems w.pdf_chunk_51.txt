errors due to pitch variations on the GV (Vivekanandan et al. 2014). Operating at 95 GHz 
frequency, the HCR suffers from signal attenuation due to absorption by water vapor and 
oxygen. Corrections were made using dropsonde data obtained on CSET and applying a 
method described by Ulaby (1981) when the radar is looking downward from above the 
clouds.
The HCR characterized the cloud and precipitation structures and provided a measure of
