lidar. These measurements document the timeâ€“height evolu-
tion of water vapor in the boundary layer, something impos-
sible to assess from in situ measurements, which measure at
only a few levels, or soundings, which are sparse in time.
The BCO lidar measurements quantify the structure of
moist or dry layers in the free atmosphere, as well as vari-
ations in the cloud and sub-cloud layers, illustrating days of
more nocturnal activity (centered on 1 February), and also
