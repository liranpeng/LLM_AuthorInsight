these versions, some of which are used in this paper. In early
ATom science team meetings, there was concern about the
accuracy of NO2 direct measurements when at very low con-
centrations. A group prepared an estimate for NOx using
the NO and O3 measurements to calculate a photostation-
ary value for NO2 and thus NOx. This PSS-NOx became
the primary NOx source in version 0 (i.e., MDS-0). With
MDS-0, we chose to gap-Ô¨Åll using correlations with CO to
