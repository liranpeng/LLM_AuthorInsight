vertically from the surface to 700 hPa in both seasons. The
spatial pattern of the magnitude of convective mass ﬂuxes
averaged over the mid-upper troposphere shows the largest
decreases occurring along the ITCZ (including the ITCZ por-
tion over Africa) in both seasons for all CCMs (Figs. 8 and
9).
Although convective mass ﬂuxes predominately decrease
under greenhouse gas warming, there are small areas of in-
crease. Close to the surface in the tropics increases in convec-
