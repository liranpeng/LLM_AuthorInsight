O3 precursors for the AIR and SHIP sectors between 2000
and 2025, and also further to 2050 (Table 1; see also Fig. 1
in H2011). On the other hand, ROAD emissions of CO, NOx
and NMHC are expected to decrease rapidly and will evolve
from being the transport sector with the highest to the lowest
NOx emissions during the period from 2000 to 2050. In 2050,
ROAD NOx emissions in the A1B scenario are less than 20 %
of the year 2000 emissions, due to strict vehicle emission
