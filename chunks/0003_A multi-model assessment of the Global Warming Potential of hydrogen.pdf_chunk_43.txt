Following the same method as for hydrogen, we can calculate
GWP100 for methane. Our model ensemble has a methane
GWP100 of 26.6 (23–33 model range) (Supplementary Fig. 3),
comparable to the IPCC AR6 values GWP100 of 27.0 ± 11 (90%
conﬁdence interval)33. The model mean methane perturbation
lifetime is 10.4 years (Supplementary Table 2) which is lower than
the IPCC AR6 assessed value of 11.8 years33 but within the
uncertainty of 1.8 years. A higher perturbation lifetime will
