mechanisms underlying this change remain unclear.
Over the mid-latitudes, there is a general consensus that
the storm tracks will shift poleward in response to future in-
creases in greenhouse gases, at least in the zonal mean (Yin
et al., 2005; Bengtssen et al., 2006; Barnes et al., 2013; Chris-
tensen et al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2016). This poleward shift in
the mid-latitude storm tracks has been dynamically linked to
the weakening of the Hadley circulation in the tropics (Vallis
