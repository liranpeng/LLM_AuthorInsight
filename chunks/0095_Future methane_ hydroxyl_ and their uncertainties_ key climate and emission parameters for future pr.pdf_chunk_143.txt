in methane lifetime during 1997â€“2009. For projections over
many decades, the parametric model also includes 5 factors
for anthropogenic emissions and one for methane feedback.
The ensemble of 3 models provides a measure of uncertainty
in each parametric factor, which we use to project past and
future methane and its lifetime, with uncertainties. While this
approach lacks the full complexity of atmospheric chemistry
that can be included through multi-decadal simulations of
