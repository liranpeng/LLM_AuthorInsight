M. J. Prather et al.: Tropospheric chemical reactivity from ATom measurements

masses of high NOx and high P-O3 surrounded by high L-
O3; ATom-14 eastern Paciﬁc huge air masses of very high
L-O3. Overall, the ATom data set based on 10 s (2 km) air
parcels has allowed us to partially deconstruct the spatial
scales and variability that deﬁne tropospheric chemistry from
composition to reactivity.
