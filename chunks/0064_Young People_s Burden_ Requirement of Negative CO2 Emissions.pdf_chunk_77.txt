response to even weak climate forcings such as ice age cycles
caused by small perturbations of Earth’s orbit, and still larger
climate change occurs on even longer timescales in response
to gradual changes in the balance between natural sources
and sinks of atmospheric CO2 (Zachos et al., 2001; Royer et
al., 2012; Franks et al., 2014).

Fast-feedback climate sensitivity
Doubled atmospheric CO2, a forcing of ∼4 W m−2, is a
standard forcing in studies of climate sensitivity. Charney et
