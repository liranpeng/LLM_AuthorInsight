Figure 14. Sub-cloud layer lidar wind versus height above the R/V
Meteor. Panel (a) shows the value of the wind speed in the sub-
cloud layer, above 200 m. Fluctuations of the near-surface wind
speed from a 3-hourly running mean value (b) are shown with an
expanded vertical scale. The lower time series (c) shows the ratio
of the wind speed at 40 m (the lowest remotely sensed level) to its
value at 200 m.
