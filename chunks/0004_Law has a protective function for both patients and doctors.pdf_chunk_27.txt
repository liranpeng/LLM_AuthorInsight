indeed the only-remedy for intractable suffer-
ing and that sick and disabled people are right to
want
to
die
while
able

people
are
inherently wrong to want to die, even though
people in both groups may request death equally
fervently and for much the same reason.
Roberts and Kjellstrand are right to say that
the medical profession must say "enough" to
pain and suffering. The point they miss is that
there are ways of saying this that do not entail
killing the patient.
