the mesoscale cloud organization with evolving environmen-
tal conditions might play a role in low-cloud feedbacks. To
address these questions, EUREC4A developed techniques to
measure the strength of convective-scale and large-scale ver-
tical motions in the lower troposphere, together with the co-
incident cloud-base cloud fractions, in addition to other pos-
sible drivers of changes in mesoscale cloud patterns, such as
coherent structures within the sub-cloud layer, radiative cool-
