longer wavelength bins (S25–S27) are fully absorbed in the
uppermost part of the cloud (τ < 1), while the shorter wave-
lengths (S19–S24) penetrate the cloud to scattering optical
depths of order τ ∼8. RRTMG consistently calculates lower
in-cloud rates; see below. It is possible that Solar-J’s greater
heating in stratus clouds may change the dynamics of stratus
clouds relative to a model using RRTMG-SW (Harrington et
al., 2000). At low sun (SZA = 84◦), Solar-J calculates 4 %
