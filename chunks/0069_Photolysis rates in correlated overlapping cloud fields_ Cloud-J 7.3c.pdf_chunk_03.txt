Another improvement in modeling J values, the treatment
of volatile organic compounds with pressure-dependent cross
sections, is also incorporated into Cloud-J.

Introduction
Photolysis, the dissociation of molecules upon absorbing
sunlight, drives atmospheric chemistry and controls the com-
position of the air we breathe. Photolysis rates are governed
by the intensity and spectral distribution of sunlight, which
