Fig. 15. The sensitivity of frontal density gradients to spatial
resolution was explored by subsampling data from 0.08 to
100 km (Fig. 15). For each length scale, the percentage fre-
quency of each density gradient was calculated. This analy-
sis demonstrates that smaller length scales yield larger den-
sity gradients. The largest gradients were found at spatial
scales of only 1 km and were associated with strong, local
freshening. These are believed to be associated with small-
