If the sum of the weights for point x from sites k is zero,
a null value is given to that point. Our interpolation algo-
rithm calculates values at points for a single day using only
measurements from that day. Implementation of spatiotem-
poral interpolation is complex, with no speciﬁc implemen-
tation well agreed upon for applications to air quality data
