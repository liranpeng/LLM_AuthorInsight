and longwave radiation, known as the aerosol direct eﬀect.70
Aerosols can also alter the properties of clouds through
indirect eﬀects (by aﬀecting cloud microphysics),71 the semi-direct
eﬀect (where aerosol absorption aﬀects temperature structure),72
and cloud absorption eﬀects (from absorbing aerosol inclusions
within or interstitially between hydrometeors).73 When absorbing
aerosols (i.e. BC and potentially dust) are deposited onto snow
