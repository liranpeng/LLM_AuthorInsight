ios. ROAD had the largest positive impact on net RF in 2000,
but it will probably shift to yield slightly negative net im-
pact in 2050 for both scenarios. As mentioned in Section 3.4,
the net negative impact is present because we take into ac-
count the time-history of emissions, which in this case gives
additional weight to the long-lived cooling terms (CH4 RF
and CH4-induced O3 RF) due to the rapid decline of NOx
emissions for ROAD in the years preceding 2050. It is also
