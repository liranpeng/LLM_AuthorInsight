baseline and reference. Figure 7 shows the magnitude of the time-mean pattern errors (Equation 6)
for each output variable except the total water path advective tendency which was not available for
the baseline run. Out of the 44 output variables, an impressive 41 have lower RMSE for ACE when
compared to the baseline.
Figure 8 shows the time- and global-mean bias (Equation 7) for all output channels. In general biases
