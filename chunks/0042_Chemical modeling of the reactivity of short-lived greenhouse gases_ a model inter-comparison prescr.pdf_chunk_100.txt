tem models. The goal is to take a time stream of species-
rich, high-resolution (100â€“300 m), spatially sparse observa-
tions, such as from an aircraft mission (e.g., ATom, 2017),
and have the current 3-D global or regional models use that
observed data directly to evaluate chemical reactivity in each
parcel. With this protocol, we avoid model artifacts in the
data stream, such as occur in assimilated data, but must ac-
