J. Hsu et al.: A radiative transfer module
their importance in tropospheric heating rates. For our clear-
sky case here (Table 4, Fig. 2), we ﬁnd an average tropo-
spheric heating rate of 2.4 K day−1. The contribution of CH4
to this total is 0.1 %; that of CO2 is complex because of the
stratospheric self-shielding but is less than ±1 % in the tro-
posphere, and that of O2 is about 3 % uniformly throughout
