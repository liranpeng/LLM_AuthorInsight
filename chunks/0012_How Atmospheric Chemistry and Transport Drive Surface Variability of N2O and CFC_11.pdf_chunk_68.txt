during the weak maximum of Cycle 24 in 2011–2015 (WMO 2018, Figures 3–7). This has a small impact, 
but UV-flux driven increase in N2O loss is estimated to be a 4%–7% at full solar maximum (P2015's Table 2). 
Since the recent Cycle 24 had less than half the amplitude of typical cycles, we estimate that N2O loss may 
have increased by about 0.3 TgN/yr. This solar cycle was not included in LMDz5 and UCI but was in GMI.
