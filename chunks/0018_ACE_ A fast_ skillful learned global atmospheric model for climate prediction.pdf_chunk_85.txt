nearly conserves column moisture for individual timesteps. Here we compute the area-weighted
global mean of Equation 1 and show the global budget violation (left-hand side of Equation 1 minus
right-hand side of Equation 1) in the left panel of Figure 11. Although for most of the simulation the
violation is not overly large (magnitude less than 0.1 mm/day; compared to typical values of global
mean precipitation or evaporation of 3 mm/day) at certain times in the simulation the global budget
