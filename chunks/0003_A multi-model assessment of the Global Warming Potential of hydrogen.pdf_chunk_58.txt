in calculating successive perturbations in this way is ensuring that
the higher-order terms become small, and that we have identiÔ¨Åed
all the major chemical couplings. Thus, it will be important to do
atmospheric chemistry-model calculations as full emissions-
driven calculations for methane and to ensure that our separa-
tion of the problem into two constrained calculations has not
missed any important chemical couplings.
We have run the models with present-day background levels of
