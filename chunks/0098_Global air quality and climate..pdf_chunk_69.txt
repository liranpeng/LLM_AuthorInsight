includes opposing inﬂuences from the direct eﬀect (0.31 W m2)
and indirect eﬀect (+0.23 W m2). In their simulations,
particle growth from SOA condensation combined with a
larger coagulation sink for small particles leads to a warming
indirect eﬀect from SOA. Further work is needed to reconcile
the sign of the SOA inﬂuence on the cloud albedo feedback.
