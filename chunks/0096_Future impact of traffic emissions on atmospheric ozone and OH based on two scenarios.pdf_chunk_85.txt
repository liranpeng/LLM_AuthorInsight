calculations. The factors to correct for the transient response
in the calculation of RF due to CH4 for ROAD in the B1
scenario are 1.56 and 2.57 for 2025 and 2050, respectively.
Figure 5 shows the resulting RF from the six models (en-
semble mean and standard deviation) for each of the three
transport sectors. Focusing on RF due to O3 (Fig. 5, top),
there is clearly a large uncertainty in the magnitude of im-
pact from AIR in the middle of this century. Although there
