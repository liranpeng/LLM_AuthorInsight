that these regions are somewhat larger than the smaller sub-
regions used to analyse the seasonality in the multi-model
ensemble monthly mean near-surface O3 behaviour in Section 4.1

global regions we determine the impact that applying A1B_HIGH
has on regional air quality during JJA and show the variations in
exceedences for the years 2025 and 2050.
