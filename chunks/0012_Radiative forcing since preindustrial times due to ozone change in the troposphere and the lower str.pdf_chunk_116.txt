of the stratosphere, and the ozone loss leads to a de-
crease in solar absorption.
Consistent with these con-
siderations, all models calculate a general cooling of the
stratosphere and a warming of the troposphere since prein-
dustrial times.
The annually averaged global-mean tem-
perature increase in the surface layer amounts to 1.25 K
(ULAQ), 0.62 K (DLR E39C), 0.36 K (NCAR MACCM),
0.21 K (CHASER), 1.59 K (STOCHEM HadGEM1), and
0.70 K (UM CAM), which is in reasonable agreement with
