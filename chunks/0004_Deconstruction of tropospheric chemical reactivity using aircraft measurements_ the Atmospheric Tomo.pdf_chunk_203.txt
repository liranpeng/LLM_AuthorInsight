from soils where the loss frequencies do not respond to a CH4
perturbation (e.g., Holmes, 2018). This full budget calcula-
tion gives a reduced sTOTAL of −0.25 and ff = 1.34, quite in
line with recent global model results (1.30 ± 0.07, Thornhill
et al., 2021b). We do not support the use of ATom-like chem-
ical climatologies as a comparable result relative to the CTM
or CCMs, but they do provide a measurement check point
and estimate of ﬁrst-order responses of tropospheric chem-
