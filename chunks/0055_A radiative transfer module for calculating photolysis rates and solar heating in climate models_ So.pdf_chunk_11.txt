proved cloud overlap algorithm based on observed decorre-
lation lengths with the cloud quadrature scheme (Neu et al.,
2007) for averaging over independent column atmospheres.
It includes an eight-stream scattering photolysis code with
semi-spherical geometry and wavelength integration over 18
spectral bins from 177 to 850 nm. In the most recent version
(v7.4), the spectrum was shortened to 778 nm (see Fig. 1).
