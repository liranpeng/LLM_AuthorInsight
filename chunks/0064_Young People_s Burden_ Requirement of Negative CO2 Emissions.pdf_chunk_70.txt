even after 100 years only 60–75 % of the surface warming
for a given forcing has occurred, the remaining 25–40 % still
being “in the pipeline” (Hansen et al., 2011; Collins et al.,
2013). Moreover, we outline in the next section that global
warming can activate “slow” feedbacks, such as changes of
ice sheets or melting of methane hydrates, so the time for the
system to reach a fully equilibrated state is even longer.
GHGs have been increasing for more than a century and
