yr, and thus, for the same stratospheric abundance and loss, the tropospheric burden is larger than when 
run at steady state. This effect is <1% (i.e., a 4-year lag from troposphere to mid-stratosphere) and also well 
within the uncertainties here.
Solar-cycle variations in ultraviolet (UV) flux along with ensuing photochemical changes in O3 are included 
in GMI and (obviously) in the observations, but not in LMDz5 or UCI. The change in N2O loss from solar
