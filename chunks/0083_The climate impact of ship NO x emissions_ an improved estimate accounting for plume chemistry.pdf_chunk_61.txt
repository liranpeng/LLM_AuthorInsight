ﬁciency. RF values are scaled to emissions of 1 Tg(N) yr−1
and are for steady-state conditions. We report results from
individual models in multi-model studies where possible. All
of these RF estimates have assumed instant dilution of ship
emissions, which biases the RF values as we show below.
From the literature ensemble, we estimate the O3 RF
to be +6.0 ± 1.9 mW m−2 and the CH4 RF to be −8.0 ±
2.4 mW m−2 for 1 Tg(N) yr−1. This average neglects two
