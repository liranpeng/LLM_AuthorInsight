strated. Such an objective climatology containing these key
species is anticipated from the NASA Atmospheric Tomog-
raphy (ATom) aircraft mission (2015–2020), executing pro-
ﬁles over the Paciﬁc and Atlantic Ocean basins. This model-
ing study addresses a core part of the design of ATom.

To understand global atmospheric chemistry is to understand
the chemical heterogeneity of air parcels across the vastness
of the troposphere (e.g., Fishman et al., 1996; Ehhalt et al.,
