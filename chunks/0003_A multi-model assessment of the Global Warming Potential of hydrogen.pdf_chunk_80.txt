The ozone radiative forcing is calculated from the changes in the monthly mean
three-dimensional ozone ﬁelds in the perturbations compared to the control
simulation multiplied by a monthly three-dimensional kernel for ozone radiative
forcing28. As in IPCC AR6, we do not add any adjustments and use the radiative
forcing values as ERF.
For stratospheric water vapor, the radiative forcing is calculated ofﬂine
consistently for all models using separate radiative transfer schemes for longwave
