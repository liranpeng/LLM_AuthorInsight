averaged over years 2000–2006 with magnitude contoured by colors and directions shown in arrows (see main and
supplementary texts for details). (d) Seasonal cycle of hemispherically integrated ozone ﬂuxes across 100 hPa (in Tg/yr).
Solid lines are estimates using the monthly mean vertical residual velocity multiplied by the corresponding monthly
mean ozone abundances w∗O3. The dashed lines are the exact simulated CTM ﬂuxes wO3 across the same level. Both
