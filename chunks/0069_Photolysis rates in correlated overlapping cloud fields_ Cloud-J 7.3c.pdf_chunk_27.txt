2007), the cloud fractions in Cloud-J are quantized to limit
the number of ICAs in a MAX group. The examples here use
10 bins, and hence cloud fractions are limited to 0, 10, 20,
30, ... 100 %. With this binning, the in-cloud water content
is scaled to conserve the cloud-water content in each layer.
This approximation is now resolution independent in terms
of the number of model layers and limits each MAX group
to 10 ICAs.
