from a range of satellite measurements, including the MLS
O3 used here that is driving the change in J-N2O. For the up-
per stratospheric tropics (1â€“10 hPa), the generally observed
O3 trend of order +1.0 %/decade to +1.6 %/decade is con-
sistent with the vertical pattern and magnitude of the J-N2O
trend. Another source of declining J-N2O is the reduction in
photolysis cross sections from lower temperatures. We cal-
culate that the relative change in J in this altitude region is
