physics scheme79. CAM5 macro-physics draws from Park
and Bretherton’s shallow convection and moist turbulence
schemes80, and its planetary boundary layer (PBL) packages
are based on Bretherton and Park’ moist turbulence parame-
terization81. SPCAM5 uses idealized cloud resolving models
(CRM) in order to nearly explicitly resolve atmospheric moist
convection. In particular, SPCAM5 uses the one-moment
cloud micro-physics. The SPCAM5 runs considered use 32
CRM columns and 25 CRM vertical levels.
