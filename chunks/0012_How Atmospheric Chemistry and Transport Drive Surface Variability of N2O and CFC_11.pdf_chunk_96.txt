surface variability for UCI (σ = 0.03%/yr), GMI (σ = 0.03%/yr), and NOAA observations (σ = 0.04%/yr) 
are all comparable, however, LMDz5 variability is twice as large (σ = 0.08%/yr). For LMDz5 and GMI, the 
amplitudes in each hemisphere are similar, but for UCI and NOAA, the amplitude is much greater in the 
SH than in the NH. This larger SH amplitude of QBO-modulated signal was expected for the UCI CTM as it
