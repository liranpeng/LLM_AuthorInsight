pre-existing functional relations in unphysical ways (e.g.,
Thuburn and Mclntyre, 1997). For example, long-lived trace
species in the stratosphere are known to be functionally re-
lated (Plumb, 2007), and the simulation of cloud–aerosol in-
teractions depends on accurate preservation of relations be-
tween tracers (Ovtchinnikov and Easter, 2009). Based on the
“boomerang ﬂow”, Lauritzen and Thuburn (2012) proposed
an idealized test to assess how well schemes maintain a non-
