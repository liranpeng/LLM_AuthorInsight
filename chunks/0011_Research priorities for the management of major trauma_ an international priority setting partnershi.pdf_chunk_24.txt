Creation of indicative questions and evidence-checking
The steering group met to systematically assess all themes 
and summary questions. Similar questions were consol-
idated into indicative questions, ensuring the repre-
sentation of each original submission. Each indicative 
question underwent review in the steering group meeting 
to enhance readability and verify that the language was 
comprehensible to both patients and stakeholder groups.
