performed on the distributions of areal extent. For example,
the year 2006 in EU was once again found to be statistically
different (p < 0.05) than the years listed above for the dis-
tributions of areal extent. At the 90 % level, it was different
from all years except 2007. Finally, the mean episode size
(Table 3, denoted ( Â¯S)yr for the 10-per-year case) also varies
from year to year and shows a strong agreement with the
annual number of AQX events in the 100-per-decade case.
