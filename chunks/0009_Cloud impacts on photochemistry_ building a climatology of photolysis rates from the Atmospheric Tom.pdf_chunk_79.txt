as often). In the North Paciﬁc, this pattern holds although
both groups show slightly greater frequency of enhanced Js,
e.g., 50 to 60 % for Group 1 and 80 to 90 % for Group 2.
For J-NO2, the results are similar, but with greater average
magnitude of enhancement for cloudy skies (20 % vs. 10 %)
and a slightly greater frequency of occurrence (thick line on
the right). For this upper tropospheric layer, none of the mod-
els show signiﬁcant occurrence of diminished J values from
