ing and thus accumulate more HNO3 and HOx precursors
like HOOH, affecting L-CH4. No other simple objective ap-
proach has been found, and we must accept and document
these biases in the A-runs.
An examination of how the A- and C-runs differ is shown
in Fig. 2 using the UCI-CTM’s 1-D probability distribu-
tions of six key species (NOx, HNO3, HNO4, PAN, HCHO,
HOOH) for the central tropical Paciﬁc. The initial distribu-
