reduction starting in 2021, as well as scenarios with constant
emissions and +2 % yr−1 emission growth starting in 2016
(Figs. 10b and 12b). The −6 and −3 % yr−1 scenarios leave
a requirement to extract 153 and 237 PgC from the air during
this century. Constant emission and +2 % yr emission sce-
narios yield extraction requirements of 695 and 1630 PgC to
reach 350 ppm CO2 in 2100.
Total CO2 extraction requirements for these scenarios are
given in Fig. 10. Cost estimates here for extraction use
