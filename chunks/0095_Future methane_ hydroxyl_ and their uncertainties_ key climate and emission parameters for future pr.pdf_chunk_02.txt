rological factors, and chemistry-climate feedbacks. Uncer-
tainty in any of these inﬂuences or the underlying processes
implies uncertainty in future abundance and radiative forc-
ing. We simulate methane lifetime in three chemical trans-
port models (CTMs) – UCI CTM, GEOS-Chem, and Oslo
CTM3 – over the period 1997–2009 and compare the mod-
els’ year-to-year variability against constraints from global
methyl chloroform observations. Using sensitivity tests, we
