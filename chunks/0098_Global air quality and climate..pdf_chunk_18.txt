is not well-suited to the short-lived, heterogenous distributions
of air pollutants and their precursors (except for the well-
mixed greenhouse gas CH4) which vary in their forcing

(GCMs), which allows for the direct examination of climate
responses to air pollutants and their precursors, and some
