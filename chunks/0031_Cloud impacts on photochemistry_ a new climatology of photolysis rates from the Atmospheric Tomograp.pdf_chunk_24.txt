to generate actinic ﬂuxes with a 1 nm wavelength grid from
292–700 nm. The calculation is run with no clouds and no
aerosols and a ﬁxed surface albedo of 0.06, and applies
ozone columns from the satellite Ozone Monitoring Instru-
ment (Levelt et al., 2006; Veefkind et al., 2006). CAFS and
TUV spectra are processed using the same photolysis fre-
quency code to ensure that the same quantum yield, absorp-
tion cross section, and temperature and pressure dependence
