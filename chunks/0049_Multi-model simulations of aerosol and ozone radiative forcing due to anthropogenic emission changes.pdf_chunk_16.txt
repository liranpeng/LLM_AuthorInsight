al. (2014) simulated a weak direct aerosol effect forcing of
+0.06 W m−2 over the 1996–2010 period, but with a much
stronger forcing of +0.42 W m−2 for the total aerosol effect.
At present, aerosol forcing is diagnosed using a wide range
of methods, with various degrees of sophistication of the
aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions included.
To span this range and take different approaches into account,
we encouraged the modelling groups participating in this
