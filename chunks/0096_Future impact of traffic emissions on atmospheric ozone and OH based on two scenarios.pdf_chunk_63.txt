on the global OH budget due to large amounts of NOx which
were released into the relatively clean maritime boundary
layer (Hoor et al., 2009). Our results indicate that the OH
impact from SHIP is even stronger in 2050 A1B and with
absolute values that peak near the surface at northern mid-
latitudes (Fig. 4, middle). As was the case with ozone, the
impact of ROAD on global OH concentrations is expected
to decrease markedly from 2000 to 2050. While Hoor et
