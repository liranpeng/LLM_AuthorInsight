sea level was about 130 m (∼400 ft) lower than today. Global
warming of ∼5 ◦C between the last glacial maximum and the
Holocene (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013) is accounted for al-
most entirely by radiative forcing caused by decrease in ice
sheet area and increase in GHGs (Lorius et al., 1990; Hansen
et al., 2007).
The glacial–interglacial timescale is set by the timescale
of the weak orbital forcings. Before addressing the crucial
issue of the inherent timescale of slow feedbacks, we need to
