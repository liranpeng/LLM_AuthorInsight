of the models do not include stratospheric chemistry and thus
could not integrate scenario 1c. For these models the differ-
ence “2 minus 1b” is shown, which corresponds to “2 minus
1c” without accounting for changes in stratospheric chem-
istry. Ozone increases are seen throughout the troposphere,
except at high southern latitudes, where some models cal-
culate decreases in ozone in the upper troposphere. In low
latitudes the ozone increase extends to very high altitudes,
