resolved coherent weather phenomena – frontal systems and
typhoons.

CorrDiff is sample-efficient, learning effectively from just 3
years of data.
4. 4.
CorrDiff on a single GPU is at least 22 times faster and 1,300
times more energy efficient than the numerical model used to
produce its high-resolution training data, which is run on 928
CPU cores, see Supplementary Section 7.3 for details.
