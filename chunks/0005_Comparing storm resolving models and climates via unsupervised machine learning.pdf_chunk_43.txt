vertical velocity profiles, we can also identify geographic regions that are most affected by climate change.
In order to investigate the geographic effects of global warming on convection and specific regions where 
convection undergoes the most significant changes, we build on the methods described in “Latent space inquiry 
uncovers differences among storm-resolving models” by first learning global convection clusters and initializing
