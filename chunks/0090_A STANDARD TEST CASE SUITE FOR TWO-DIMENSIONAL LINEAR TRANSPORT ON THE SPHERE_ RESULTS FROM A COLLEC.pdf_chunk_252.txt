resolutions. The effect of shape-preserving ﬁlters on conver-
gence rates was also examined. The convergence rates and
effect of shape-preserving ﬁlters varied signiﬁcantly among
the schemes that participated in this intercomparison. The
greatest reductions in convergence rates were seen for for-
mally high-order schemes for which rates dropped by several
orders to about second-order.
