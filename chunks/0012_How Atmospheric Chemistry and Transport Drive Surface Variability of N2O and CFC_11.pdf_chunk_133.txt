dence based on three similar results, that the NH annual cycle in N2O due to stratospheric influence is well 
determined in phase and amplitude. In addition, we have confidence that the north-south gradient in N2O 
caused by the stratosphere is at most ±0.3 ppb, is much less than the observed interhemispheric gradient of 
∼1 ppb, which thus must be driven by emissions being larger in the NH than in the SH. Our results support
