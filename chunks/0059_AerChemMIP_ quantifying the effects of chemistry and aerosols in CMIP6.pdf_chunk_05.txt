emissions, atmospheric composition, and radiative ef-
fects?
These questions will be addressed through targeted simula-
tions with CMIP6 climate models that include an interac-
tive representation of tropospheric aerosols and atmospheric
chemistry. These simulations build on the CMIP6 Diagnos-
tic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK) ex-
periments, the CMIP6 historical simulations, and future pro-
jections performed elsewhere in CMIP6, allowing the con-
