sive, however, which restricts the number of socioeconomic
scenarios and ensemble members that can be explored.
In this work we develop a new parametric model for global
methane lifetime that accounts for climate-chemistry interac-
tions that were neglected in previous parametric approaches.
We derive the parametric factors from perturbation tests in
a suite of 3 chemical transport models (CTMs), since CTMs
with detailed tropospheric chemistry provide the best mech-
