particularly for aerosols, and there is some evidence that
the global climate response to a regional-scale NTCF differs
from that of an equivalent globally homogeneous radiative
forcing (Shindell et al., 2012b, 2015). Changes in the abun-
dance of NTCFs can also induce rapid adjustments in mete-
orological quantities (such as atmospheric temperature, wa-
ter vapour, clouds) through radiative heating/cooling and/or
effects on precipitation and cloud lifetime (Sherwood et al.,
