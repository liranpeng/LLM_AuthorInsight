ROAD was not included in H2011, but comparison with the
study of Hoor et al. (2009) for the year 2000 shows that the
O3 impact from this trafﬁc sector will decrease substantially.
The maximum zonal mean O3 impact from ROAD in the
lower troposphere during summer will be about 3 ppbv and
the maximum zonal mean relative impact ∼1 % in 2050 A1B
(Fig. 2), compared to more than 6 ppbv and 4 %, respectively,
in year 2000 (Hoor et al., 2009).
