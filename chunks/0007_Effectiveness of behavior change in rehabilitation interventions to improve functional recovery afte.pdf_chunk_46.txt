considerable, but within threshold when including all six 
studies (I2 = 75%). When removing Vioreauna 2007 [30], 
which was judged as high risk of bias, heterogeneity was 
reduced substantially (I2 = 0%). Of note, the mean OMAS 
in both treatment groups in Vioreanu 2007 [30] was con-

other published studies in this population [28, 31]. This 
can be seen in Table 2. This may indicate that the patient
