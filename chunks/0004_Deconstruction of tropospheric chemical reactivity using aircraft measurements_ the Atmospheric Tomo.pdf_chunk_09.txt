each with its own mixture of species and each with its own
chemical production and/or loss rates that are designated here
as reactivities: P-O3, L-O3, L-CH4, and L-CO (see Prather
et al., 2017, 2018, and hence P2017 and P2018). A reactivity
is calculated as the 24 h integration of a reaction rate or the
sum of several reaction rates that describe budgets of species
in units of parts per billion (10âˆ’9 mole fraction) per day. In
this paper we continue our efforts to deconstruct global tro-
