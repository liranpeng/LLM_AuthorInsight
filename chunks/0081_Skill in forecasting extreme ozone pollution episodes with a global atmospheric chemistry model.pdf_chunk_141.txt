Developing climate statistics of AQX episodes
The episode size distributions in Fig. S6 in the Supplement
show clear differences across the years; however we need
an objective measure of these differences. The Anderson–
Darling (AD) test (Anderson and Darling, 1952) compares
two CDFs (equivalently CCDFs) and gives a conﬁdence
level that they occur from the same underlying and unknown
distribution (the AD null hypothesis). The AD test is non-
