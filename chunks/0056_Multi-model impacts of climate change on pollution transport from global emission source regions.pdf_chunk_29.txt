Ô¨Årst time seasonal transport changes in response to climate
change and their dynamical attribution. Section 2 describes
the models used while Sect. 3 discusses future changes
in CO-tracer mixing ratios (with emissions held constant).
Section 4 outlines the transport processes and circulation
changes that most likely drive CO-tracer redistribution under
climate change. Discussion and conclusions are presented in
Sect. 5.
