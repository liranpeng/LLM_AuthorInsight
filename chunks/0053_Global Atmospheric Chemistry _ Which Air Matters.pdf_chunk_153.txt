P-O3 occurring near the surface and in the upper tropo-
sphere; however, not all models show the same shift, im-
plying a very different distribution of reactivity and/or
dependence on the key species.
– Representativeness, speciﬁcally the ability of a few Pa-
ciﬁc transects to provide a chemical climatology for the
entire basin, was tested extensively in model F for aver-
age reactivities across different longitudes and days and
showed modest variability; when compared in terms of
