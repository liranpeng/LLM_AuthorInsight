axisymmetric windspeed maximum increases from 22 ms−1 in
ERA5 to 33 ms−1, compared with 45 in WRF – both favorable
improvements. Ultimately, CorrDiff is able to synthesis consistent
radar reflectivity (see top row of Fig. 3).
For further discussion of typhoon downscaling, we refer the
interested reader to Supplementary Section 7.2, where we explore
additional date- times for Haikui (2023), investigate an additional
typhoon Chanthu (2021), and analyze generated wind statistics
