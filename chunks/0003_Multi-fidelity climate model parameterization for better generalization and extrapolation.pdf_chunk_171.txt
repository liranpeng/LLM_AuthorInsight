poor performance even in the period between February 1st 2003 and April 31st 2003 (figures 11.a and 11.d). On the other
hand, their error temporal variations for the vertical levels 494 and 761 hPa do show a significantly lower performance when
extrapolating beyond the training period (figures 11.b, 11.c, 11.e and 11.f). These results along with those obtained for the heat
