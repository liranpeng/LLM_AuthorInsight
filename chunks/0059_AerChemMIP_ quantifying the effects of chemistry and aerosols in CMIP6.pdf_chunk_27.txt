istry. The aim of ACCMIP (Lamarque et al., 2013) was to
quantify the contribution of ozone and aerosols to the radia-
tive forcing in the CMIP5 models that included these com-
ponents. In practice, the model setups for CMIP5 and AC-
CMIP were usually different (the ACCMIP models tended
to have lower resolution but include greater complexity in
chemistry and aerosols) so that ACCMIP was not able to
fully characterise the forcings of most simulations submitted
