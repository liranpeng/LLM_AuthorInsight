mate the effect of changes in tropospheric chemistry sepa-
rately. In all models the difference “2 minus 1c” yields a
much larger tropospheric ozone increase than “2 minus 1a”.
For example in the ULAQ model the tropospheric column
reduction of −2.6 DU (“2 minus 1a”) reﬂects the inﬂuence
of stratospheric ozone depletion on tropospheric ozone. By
contrast, the difference “2 minus 1c” yields a tropospheric
column enhancement of 7.9 DU, related to the increase in
