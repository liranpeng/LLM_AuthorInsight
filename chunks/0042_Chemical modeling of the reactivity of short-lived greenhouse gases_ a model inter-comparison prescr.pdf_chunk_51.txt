large scatter in both P -O3 and L-O3. While consistency does
not guarantee correct implementation of the photochemical
model (i.e., rate coefﬁcients, cross sections), uniqueness is
something that needs more investigation as it may be an er-
ror or may lead to ﬁxes in the “consistent” models. Scatter
plots of J-NO2 and J-O1D vs. L-O3 (Fig. S4) show simi-
lar J-value statistics for the ﬁve non-GISS models, and all
models show a similar location of the three sets of points
