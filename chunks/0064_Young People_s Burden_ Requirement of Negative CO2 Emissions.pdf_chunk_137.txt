Fig. 12a. If emissions grow 2 % yr−1, modestly slower
than the 2.6 % yr−1 growth of 2000–2015, warming reaches
∼4 ◦C by 2100. Warming is about 2 ◦C if emissions are con-
stant until 2100. Furthermore, both scenarios launch.
Earth onto a course of more dramatic change well beyond
the initial 2–3 ◦C global warming, because (1) warming con-
