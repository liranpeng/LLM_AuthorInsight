of hydrogen leads to as much global warming as 4.3 kg of CO2. A
follow-up study with the STOCHEM-CRI model found a
GWP100 value of 5 ± 115. Recent studies have made a step for-
ward in the research of the climate effect of hydrogen emissions
by including the combined effects in the troposphere and stra-
tosphere using global 3D models. Using the UKESM1 model with
prescribed hydrogen surface concentrations, a much higher
hydrogen
GWP100
of
12 ± 6
was
estimated16.
