due to climate feedbacks, which is about twice the change
in wetland emissions since the preindustrial era (Houweling
et al., 2000). We use the parametric model to predict future
τCH4×OH and assume other loss rates are constant. For future
predictions we use the same expanded set of 11 parameters
as were used in the historical τCH4×OH reconstruction (Ta-
ble 2, last column). Table 3 lists data sources for the future
climate and emission variables. We then generate 105 monte
