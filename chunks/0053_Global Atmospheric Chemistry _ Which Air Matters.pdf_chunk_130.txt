Figure 7. Model E (GMI CTM) 2-D probability distributions from
A-run for NOx vs. HOOH as weighted by air mass, L-CH4, L-O3,
and P-O3. The domain being sampled is 20◦S–20◦N, 150–210◦E,
0.5–12 km, see Fig. 6a.
The 2-D distributions simply weighted by AIR show re-
markable structures that differ signiﬁcantly across the mod-
els, as shown in Fig. 6, with summary statistics in Table S6.
All 2-D plots use the same 20-per-decade log scale as in the
