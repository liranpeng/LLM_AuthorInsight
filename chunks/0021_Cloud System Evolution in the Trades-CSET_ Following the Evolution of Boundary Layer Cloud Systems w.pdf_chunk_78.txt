Once in Kona, there would be another mission planning meeting the afternoon between 
flight days. During this meeting, updated trajectory end points were used to set the flight 
track back to Sacramento, using 12 UTC day-before-return-flight analysis and forecasts and 
the outbound flight path. For the RF10 July 27 example shown in Fig 3, the beginning and 
end points of the 9 trajectories selected for the sampling sequence are shown in Fig. 3b.
