double correlated-K for water vapor and liquid water within the RRTM bands may be difficult when ice 
water is added (which it must be) since the absorption features are shifted in wavelength from those of 
liquid water. Our finding like Edwards and SlingoÂ (1996) is that most of this error is simply failure to 
resolve the widely different SSA within each broad RRTM band. We suggest it is time to drop the RRTM
