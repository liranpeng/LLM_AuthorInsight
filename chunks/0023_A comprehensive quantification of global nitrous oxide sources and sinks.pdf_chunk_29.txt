since the early 1980s, and this has offset the reduction due to feedback 
with increased CO2 concentration and climate (Extended Data Fig. 6a). 
Increased CO2 concentrations enhance plant growth and thus increase 
nitrogen uptake, which in turn decreases soil N2O emissions16,19. Con-
version of land from tropical mature forests, which have higher N2O 
emissions, to pastures and other unfertilized agricultural lands has 
considerably reduced global natural N2O emissions11,20,21. This decrease,
