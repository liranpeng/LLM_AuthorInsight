models that tend to simulate ozone depletion at higher al-
titudes the (positive) SW forcing dominates, while for the
other models the (negative) LW forcing dominates. For ex-
ample, as was seen in Fig. 2, the FRSGC UCI model yields
relatively large ozone depletion in the upper regions of the
considered domain, while the UIO CTM2 model has most
of its ozone depletion in the lowermost stratosphere. This is
reï¬‚ected by relatively large positive and negative net forcings
