Dimensional splitting approach
Instead of approximating swept area ﬂuxes rigorously in
two dimensions, one may take an operator split approach,
which has been successfully applied for orthogonal (Lin
and Rood, 1996) and quasi-orthogonal grids (Putman and
Lin, 2007). The advantage of such an approach is that only
one-dimensional operators are needed. The formal accuracy,
however, is limited to second-order with the splitting. The
Lin and Rood (1996) scheme is used in NCAR’s Com-
