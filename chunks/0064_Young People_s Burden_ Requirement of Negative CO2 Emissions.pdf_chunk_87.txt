backs: (1) atmospheric GHGs (mainly CO2 but accompanied
by CH4 and N2O), which increase as Earth warms and de-
crease as it cools (Ciais et al., 2013), thus amplifying the
temperature change, and (2) the size of ice sheets, which
shrink as Earth warms and grow as it cools, thus changing the
amount of absorbed sunlight in the sense that also ampliÔ¨Åes
the climate change. For example, 20 000 years ago most of
Canada and parts of the US were covered by an ice sheet, and
