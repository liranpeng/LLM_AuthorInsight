rms differences in J-values for GISS and NCAR are surpris-
ing. Collectively, we should reexamine this variability in all
the models to ascertain its cause. In general, the slopes of the
individual vs. reference model for reactivities are close to 1
(Table S2) because the slope is determined by the large gra-
dients with latitude and pressure that most models agree on.
In comparing individual days vs. 5-day mean, it is encour-
aging that this slope averages 1 Â± 0.04 for all reactivities and
