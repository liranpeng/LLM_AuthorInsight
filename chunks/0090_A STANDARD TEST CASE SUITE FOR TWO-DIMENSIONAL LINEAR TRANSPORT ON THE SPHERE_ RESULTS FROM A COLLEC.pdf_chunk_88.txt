2.2.3
Lagrangian ﬁnite volume
A scheme for which the Lagrangian areas are retained for
longer than one time step is the trajectory-tracking scheme
(Dong and Wang, 2012) based on tracking interfaces (TTS-I,
Dong and Wang, 2013). The advantage of tracing interfaces
is that large gradients or even discontinuities are preserved.
