attention in recent years as a means to address jointly air
pollution and climate goals.3,28â€“30 The dominant CH4 sink
occurs through oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH) in the
troposphere, which leads to a unique sensitivity of this green-
house gas to air pollutants and their precursors. Indirect RFs
from O3 precursors can occur via precursor-induced changes in
oxidant concentrations, which can alter aerosol burdens; similarly,
changes in aerosol burdens may alter O3 concentrations.27,31,32
