of them simulated a two years period and included higher or-
der chemistry schemes. These ﬁve models contribute to the
ensemble mean results, which are presented in the follow-
ing (TM4, p-TOMCAT, OsloCTM2, UCI and LMDzINCA).
One model (E39/C) was used in a different mode to pro-
vide information on the interannual variability of the traf-
ﬁc impact using a ten year transient simulation. Four mod-
els are CTMs using prescribed operational ECMWF data to
