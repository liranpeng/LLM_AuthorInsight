also feed back on the ocean by causing a damping of the
(sub)mesoscale activity (Renault et al., 2018). As an exam-
ple, Sullivan et al. (2020) use large-eddy simulation to show
how small-scale ocean fronts perturb the boundary layer
through its depth, giving rise to circulations on scales much
larger than that of the boundary layer, or of the front itself
(their Fig. 12). These lead to large perturbations in verti-
cal mixing and, one can speculate, on patterns of cloudi-
