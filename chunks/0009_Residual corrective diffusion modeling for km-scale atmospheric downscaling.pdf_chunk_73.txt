That is, the residual formulation reduces the variance of the target
distribution. According to (2), the variance reduction is more
pronounced when \({\rm{var}}({\mathbb{E}}[{\bf{x}}|
{\bf{y}}])\) is large, e.g., in the case of typhoons. For our specific
target data we find that the actual variance reduction is significant,
especially at large scales; see Supplementary SectionÂ 4. To sum it
up, the main idea of CorrDiff is that learning the distribution p(r)
