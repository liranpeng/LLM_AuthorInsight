scale environment. This situation led EUREC4A to develop
its measurements following the path of the NBC rings to-
ward Barbados from their place of formation near the point
of the NBC retroﬂection, with a center of action near Region
C in Fig. 1. Measurements in the Boulevard des Tourbillons
extended the upper-air measurement network and provided
cloud measurements to contrast with similar measurements
being made in Tradewind Alley.
