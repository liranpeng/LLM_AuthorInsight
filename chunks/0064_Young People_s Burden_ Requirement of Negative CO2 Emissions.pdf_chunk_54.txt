mean Eemian temperature compares to the preindustrial level
and thus to today.
McKay et al. (2011) estimated peak Eemian annual global
ocean sea surface temperature (SST) as +0.7 ± 0.6 ◦C rela-
tive to late Holocene temperature, while models, as described
by Masson-Delmotte et al. (2013), give more conﬁdence to
the lower part of that range. Hoffman et al. (2017) report
the maximum Eemian annual global SST as +0.5 ± 0.3 ◦C
relative to 1870–1889, which is +0.65 ◦C relative to 1880–
