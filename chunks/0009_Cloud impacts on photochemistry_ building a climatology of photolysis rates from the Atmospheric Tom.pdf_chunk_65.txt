minishment (rlnJ < −0.025), average rlnJ diminishment, per-
cent occurrence of nearly clear sky, percent occurrence of
enhancement (rlnJ > +0.025), and average rlnJ enhancement.
The horizontal line has a total length of 100 % with the thin
line (clear sky) centered on 0; see the extended legend in
Fig. 5b.
Overall, four models (GC, GFDL, GMI, UKCA) have
unusually narrow peak distributions of rlnJ ∼0, indicating
lesser cloud effects on the Js. The other six models (GISS,
