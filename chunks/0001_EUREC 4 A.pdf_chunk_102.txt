ing, and air mass trajectories.
To make the desired measurements required HALO and
the ATR to ﬂy closely coordinated ﬂight patterns, ideally
sampling different phases of the diurnal cycle (Vial et al.,
2019). This was realized by HALO circling (at an altitude
of 10.2 km) 3.5 times over 210 min. Within this period three
full sounding circles were deﬁned by a set of 12 dropsonde
launches, one for each 30◦change in heading. The start time
