21 sub-bins (denoted SJ/LLNL). The CLIRAD code (Chou & Suarez, 1999, revised with HITRAN 2012 data), 
used until recently by the Goddard Space Flight Center climate model, has three IR bands (0.70–10.0 μm) 
including a total of 30 sub-bins (denoted SJ/CLIRAD).
We compare these codes by running their SJ variants with only water vapor as an absorber in the IR and 
clear skies (no clouds or aerosols, see Figure 1a). Compared to SJ, SJ/CLIRAD, and SJ/LLNL have about 5
