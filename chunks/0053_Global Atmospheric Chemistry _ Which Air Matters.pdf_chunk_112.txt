50–150 ppb, and half the models (B, D, E) show a reason-
able frequency of O3 at 10 ppb and less, as might be ex-
pected in the tropical Paciﬁc boundary layer (Kley et al.,
1996; Singh et al., 1996; Nicely et al., 2016). For CO, model
A shows unusually low abundances. For NOx, models C and
F lack the NOx below 2.5 ppt that others have. The models
are quite similar for HCHO, except for D, which has an un-
usually symmetric distribution and much lower abundances.
