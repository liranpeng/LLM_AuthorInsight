BC radiative forcing does not respond linearly to emissions.
The forcing efﬁciency of BC is generally higher over regions
of southern and eastern Asia (increasing emissions) than over
Europe and the USA (decreasing emissions); see Haywood
and Ramaswamy (1998).
Figure 5a and b show the geographical distribution of the
multi-model mean 1990–2015 radiative forcing of the direct
