based schemes, shape preservation is enforced either through
FCT or by constraining the reconstruction function. When
the resolution is increased to 0.75◦(fourth column in Figs. 11
and 14), most of these schemes no longer have a bow-shaped
scatter, but the lower boundary is curved so that the scatter
points “track”/follow the pre-existing functional curve much
more closely with the majority of the scatter points inside
the convex hull. Some schemes (FARSIGHT-CN1.0 at 0.75◦,
