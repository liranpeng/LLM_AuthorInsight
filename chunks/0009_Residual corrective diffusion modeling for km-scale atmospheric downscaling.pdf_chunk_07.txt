and climate data require kilometer-scale forecasts: e.g., risk
assessment and capturing local effects of topography and human
land use11. Globally, applying Machine Learning (ML) at km-scale
resolution poses significant challenges since training costs are
superlinear with respect to the resolution of training data.
Moreover, predictions from global km-scale physical simulators are
not yet well tuned, so available training data can have worse
