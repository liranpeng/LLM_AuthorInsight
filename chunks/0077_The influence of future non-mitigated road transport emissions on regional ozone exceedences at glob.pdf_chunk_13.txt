of this century (Hoor et al., 2009). Estimates in the SRES A1B
emission scenarios (Nakicenovic et al., 2000) predict a reduction in
global Road Transport Emissions (RTE) of NOx from w9 Tg N yr1
(2000) to w7 Tg N yr1 (2025), followed by a further reduction to
w2 Tg N yr1 (2050), assuming the efÔ¨Åcient application of miti-
gation technologies. It is estimated that A1B SRES has provided the
most realistic emission estimates to date from the different SRES
