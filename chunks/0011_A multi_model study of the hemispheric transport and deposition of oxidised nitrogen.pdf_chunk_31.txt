differences in the boundary layer and convection schemes
used to mix and transport the NOy species, and the associ-
ated wet removal processes. Overall, between 3 and 10% of
NOx emitted in a HTAP region is deposited as NOy in the
other three regions (assuming individual sensitivities com-
bine linearly). Using the mean model results, between 51
and 66% of the exported NOy (or between 8 and 15% of
NOx emitted) is transported over 1000 km from the bound-
aries of the source regions.
