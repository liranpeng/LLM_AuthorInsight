v4.3.2 provided an estimate of indirect emission from non-agricultural 
sectors, whereas both FAOSTAT and GAINS—following the IPCC 
guidelines—provided NHx/NOy volatilization from agricultural sec-
tors. Here, we sum FAOSTAT or GAINS data with EDGAR v4.3.2 data 
(that is, FAOSTAT/EDGAR v4.3.2 or GAINS/EDGAR v4.3.2) to represent 
nitrogen-deposition-induced soil emissions from both agricultural and 
non-agricultural sectors. The N2O emissions from ‘Inland and coastal
