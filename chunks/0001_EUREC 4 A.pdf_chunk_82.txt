operated from Ragged Point, near the BCO, provided addi-
tional constraints on estimates of aerosol loading (from li-
dars) and column water vapor (from radiometers). Infrared
radiometers for measuring the surface skin temperature were
operated on the ATR, HALO, the R/V Ron Brown, the BO-
REAL, and CU-RAAVEN UASs, as well as on the ﬁve Sail-
drones. For estimating ﬂuxes of radiant energy, broadband
