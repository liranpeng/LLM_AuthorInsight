ing up the extrema of the cosine bells and correlated co-
sine bells. The opposite extreme of the convex hull (upper
left corner (χ,ξ) = (0.1,0.892)) contains the majority of the
data points as that is where the background value is located
on the scatterplot. Obviously, diffusive schemes will damp
the extrema, which, in terms of the scatterplot, cause scat-
ter points to shift toward the background scatter point value
(0.1,0.892) and away from the lower right corner of the
