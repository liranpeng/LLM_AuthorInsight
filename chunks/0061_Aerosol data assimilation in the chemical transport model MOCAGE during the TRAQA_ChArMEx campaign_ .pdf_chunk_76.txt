tions show increased correlation (from 0.54 for the modelled
ﬁelds to 0.82 for the assimilated ﬁelds), lowered root mean
square error (from 0.27 to 0.18) and lowered standard devia-
tion (from 0.27 to 0.17), demonstrating what we expect from
assimilation. Similar values of the root mean square error and
the standard deviation show the absence of important biases
in the system.
