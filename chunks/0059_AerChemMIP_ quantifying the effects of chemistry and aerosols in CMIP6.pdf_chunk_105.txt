diative ﬂuxes between the reference and “clean” simulations
will give the TOA and atmospheric transient ERFs. Compar-
ison between the magnitudes and patterns of transient ERF
with surface temperature and precipitation from the previous
coupled model simulations will provide quantiﬁcation of the
efﬁcacy of the NTCFs to affect climate.
The contributions of the different groups of NTCFs to
future climate will be quantiﬁed by further simulations in
