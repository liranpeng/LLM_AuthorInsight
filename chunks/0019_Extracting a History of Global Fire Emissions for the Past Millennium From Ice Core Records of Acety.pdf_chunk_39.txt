et al., 2013; Prather et al., 2012). Methane is also lost by reaction with
chlorine atoms. The magnitude of this sink term is not well constrained
but is estimated in the range of 1–5% of the total loss (Allan et al., 2007;
Prather et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2019).
Ice core measurements of the abundance of methane and its stable isoto-
pic composition (δ13CH4) have been used to reconstruct the preindustrial
methane budget (Figure 2) (Beck et al., 2018; Bock et al., 2017; Ferretti
