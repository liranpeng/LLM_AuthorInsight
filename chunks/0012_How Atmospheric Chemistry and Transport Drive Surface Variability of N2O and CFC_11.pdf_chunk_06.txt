hemisphere (SH), all three models disagree and thus provide no guidance, except for indicating that 
modeling annual STE in the SH remains a major model uncertainty. Parallel model simulations of 
CFCl3, which has greater stratospheric loss that N2O and possibly surreptitious emissions, show that 
its interannual variations parallel those of N2O, and thus the observed N2O variability can identify the 
stratospheric component of the observed CFCl3 variability.
