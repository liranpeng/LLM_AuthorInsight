(Held and Soden, 2006).
As temperatures increase in the troposphere but decrease
in the stratosphere in response to enhanced CO2 concen-
trations, there is a decrease in static stability close to the
tropopause that leads to an increase in its height (Manabe
and Wetherald, 1975; Santer et al., 2003; Lorenz and De
Weaver, 2007; Kang et al., 2013; Vallis et al., 2015). A higher
tropopause may also be associated with a poleward expan-
sion or widening of the Hadley cell (Lu et al., 2007), but the
