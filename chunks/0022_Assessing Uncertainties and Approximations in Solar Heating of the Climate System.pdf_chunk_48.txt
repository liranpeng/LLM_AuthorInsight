code. The difference RRTMG minus SJ under clear sky gave a surprisingly large difference: (+1.3, −0.5, 
−0.8 W m−2) for the three primary globally averaged components (reflection, atmospheric absorption, and 
surface absorption), respectively (T1/R4). For the UV region <298 nm, the solar flux (13.6 out of 1360.8 W 
m−2) is absorbed in the stratosphere, and both SJ and RRTMG agree on this. So focusing on the 298–778 nm
