lutions, a non-dimensionless time step of T/120 and T/240
was used for the CN ≈5.5 simulations, respectively. For
CN ≈1.0 runs, the time steps were T/600 and T/1200,
respectively. The shape-preserving ﬁlter is the fully two-
dimensional limiter by Barth and Jespersen (1989) that scales
the fully two-dimensional reconstruction polynomial of de-
gree two so that its extrema are within the range of the sur-
rounding cell-averaged values.
