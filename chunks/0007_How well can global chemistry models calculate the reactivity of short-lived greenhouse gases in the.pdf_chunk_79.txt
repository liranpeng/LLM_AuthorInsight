of linking models with similar chemistries, probably 80 %
overlap is a good mark, because we see that the different UCI
years drop off to 85 % in L-O3 and L-CH4. Overlap in P -O3
is much easier to achieve as the few high-NOx parcels drive
high P -O3 in all models: at the top-25 % parcels, the P -O3
overlap is about 84 % or better for all models.
On a day-to-day basis, we examine the top-10 % overlap
for GC–GSFC–NCAR–UCI models, using their own 5-day
