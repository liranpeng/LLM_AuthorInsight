most sensitively to ship emissions in the marine lower tropo-
sphere over the Atlantic. Based on the 5% perturbation the
effect on ozone can exceed 0.6% close to the marine surface
(global zonal mean) which is 80% of the total trafﬁc induced
ozone perturbation. In the southern hemisphere ship emis-
sions contribute relatively strongly to the total ozone pertur-
bation by 60%–80% throughout the year.
