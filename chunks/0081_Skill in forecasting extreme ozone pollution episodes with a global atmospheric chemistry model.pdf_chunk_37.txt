(Huang and Hsu, 2004). Falke (1999) incorporates a tem-
poral component by reducing the weights of highly variable
(mostly urban) sites using the variance of the sites. We do not
include this since we assume urban sites are representative
of the true processes controlling surface O3. In addition, the
