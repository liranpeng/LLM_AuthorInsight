national statistics or own calculations. National emissions
are allocated to a 1◦×1◦-grid essentially according to popu-
lation density with emissions from motorised two- and three-
wheelers biased towards agglomerations and emissions from
heavy duty vehicles biased towards rural areas. The emis-
sions used in this study are based on a draft version (Borken
and Steller, 2006). The ﬁnal inventory for road trafﬁc in-
cludes improved emission factors. With fuel consumption
