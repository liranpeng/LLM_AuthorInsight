and have clouds only in the lowermost 36 layers. ProÔ¨Åles of
temperature and ozone are taken from tropical mean obser-
vations; the Rayleigh-scattering optical depth at 600 nm is
about 0.12, and a mix of aerosol layers has a total optical
depth of 0.23. J value errors are calculated separately for
