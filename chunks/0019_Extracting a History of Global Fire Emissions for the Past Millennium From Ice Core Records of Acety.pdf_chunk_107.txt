viously thought and were more concentrated in the tropics than the modern inventory suggests, the required
biomass burning emission scenarios implied from this work would be lower. However, replacing non‚Äêboreal
(tropical) biomass burning emissions with tropically located biofuel emissions would be a roughly 1:1 trade
off and would require the same total emissions to reconstruct the acetylene and ethane records.
