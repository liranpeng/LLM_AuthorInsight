ering is speculative, but potential co-beneﬁts for temperate
and tropical agroecosystems could affect its practicality, and
may put some enhanced weathering into the category of im-
proved agricultural and forestry practices. Beneﬁts include
crop fertilization that increases yield and reduces use and
cost of other fertilizers, increasing crop protection from in-
sect herbivores and pathogens thus decreasing pesticide use
and cost, neutralizing soil acidiﬁcation to improve yield, and
