thanks to its capacity of better resolving the moisture con-
vection stochasticity within this region (figure 3 and figure
in Supplementary Information). However, the SF-HF-RPN
model fails to provide more accurate predictions within the
tropics and polar regions. The LF-RPN model improves fur-
ther upon the SF-HF-RPN model within the temperate zone
and even within the tropics and polar regions. These results
confirm the informative capacity of the low-fidelity data for
