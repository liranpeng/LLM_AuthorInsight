Radiative Forcing MIP (RFMIP)
There are considerable synergies between AerChemMIP and
RFMIP. RFMIP addresses the ERF due to all drivers for
the historical and future periods. AerChemMIP speciÔ¨Åcally
looks to quantify the ERFs for reactive species and aerosols,
and to separate individual components of these. RFMIP
also contains other components related to the assessment of
model radiation code performance and simulations with pre-
scribed aerosol distributions and aerosol optical properties
