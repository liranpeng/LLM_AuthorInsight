which has not fully responded to the climate forcing due to
increasing GHGs. However, land warming is heavily modu-
lated by the ocean temperature, so land temperature too has
not achieved its equilibrium response.
We use long climate model simulations to examine how
much the ratio of land SAT change over ocean SST change
(the observed quantities) is modiﬁed as global warming ap-
proaches its equilibrium response. This ratio is ∼1.8 in
years 901–1000 of doubled CO2 simulations (Fig. A6) for
