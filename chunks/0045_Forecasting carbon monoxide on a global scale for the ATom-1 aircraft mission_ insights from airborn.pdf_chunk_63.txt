or occurring in the upper troposphere with stratospheric in-
ﬂuence. Both model and observations indicate that the air
is relatively clean over the Paciﬁc south of 30◦N with CO
less than 70 ppb and the CO minimum around 60◦S over the
eastern South Paciﬁc. Over the Atlantic section, both model
and observations show low CO concentration south of 30◦S
but show a strong CO maximum over the tropical Atlantic
(5S–5N) with CO greater than 120 ppb. This high CO is
