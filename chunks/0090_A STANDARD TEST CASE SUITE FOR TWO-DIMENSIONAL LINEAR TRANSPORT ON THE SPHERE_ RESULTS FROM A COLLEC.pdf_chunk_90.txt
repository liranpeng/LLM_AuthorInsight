(CGA) has been developed that splits and merges edges ac-
cording to deformation criteria. The details are explained in
Dong and Wang (2013). For the computation of diagnos-
tics, the ﬁelds are mapped to a regular latitude–longitude
grid (which is also done for coupling with physical param-
eterizations). This mapping is ﬁrst-order, mass-conservative
and shape-preserving. Note that the prognostic ﬁelds are al-
ways retained in Lagrangian space, so the mapping is only
