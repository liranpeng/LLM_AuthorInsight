as nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) and hydrogen per-
oxide (HOOH) (step 1) and then calculate the CH4 and O3
reactivities from these species (step 2). There is no single
average measurement that can test the verisimilitude of the
models. Stratospheric studies such as Douglass et al. (1999)
have provided a quantitative basis for testing chemistry and
transport and deÔ¨Åning model errors, but few of these studies
have tackled the problem of modeling the heterogeneity of
