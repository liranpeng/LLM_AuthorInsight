emissions by Borken et al. (2007) are higher by 33% for
NOx and about 50% for CO emissions than those used in
this study. Nonetheless, low total CO emissions are a result
of lowered average emission factors accounting for effective
use of catalytic converters in light duty vehicles.
The resulting source strengths of NOx from the differ-
