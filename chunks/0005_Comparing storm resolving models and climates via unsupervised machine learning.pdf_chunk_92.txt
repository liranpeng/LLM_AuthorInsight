Figure 5.   Unsupervised storm-resolving model (GSRM) inter-comparison. The top panel (a) shows the ELBO 
(Eq. 3) score distribution of data from different DYAMOND simulations. (The VAE encoder is trained on 
UM data before all nine different test datasets are applied.) We see that three model types (ICON, SPCAM,
