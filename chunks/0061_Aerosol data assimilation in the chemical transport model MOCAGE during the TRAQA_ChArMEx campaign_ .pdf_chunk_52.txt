observation error correlations, which means that all non-
diagonal members (covariances) in the matrix R are zero.
The matrix R is reduced to its diagonal with the variances
of measurements:
R = Dy = diag(σ 2
obs).

The background and observation error variances, located
along the diagonal of B and R, inﬂuence the weight of the
model and observations in the cost function. In this study,
we speciﬁed them as a percentage of the ﬁrst guess ﬁeld for
