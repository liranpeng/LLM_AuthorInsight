model is used to estimate the global methane mixing ratio and Î´13CH4 isotopic signature for various emis-
sion scenarios (section 3.2). Using the ice core levels as a constraint, we estimate the emissions of the trace
gases under various scenarios. A discussion of how emission scenarios were evaluated is described in sec-
tion 3.3. Scenarios exploring changes in atmospheric lifetime due to the presence of chlorine atoms are also
described (section 3.4).
