six global chemistry models can agree on the reactivity of
these parcels. To do this, we develop a new protocol and set
of diagnostics for merging in situ measurements with 3-D
model simulations of atmospheric chemistry. We focus here
on tropospheric ozone production and loss (P -O3, L-O3)
and methane loss (L-CH4), as these two gases are the most
important GHGs controlled through tropospheric chemistry.
Further, control of CH4 and O3 provides an important path-
