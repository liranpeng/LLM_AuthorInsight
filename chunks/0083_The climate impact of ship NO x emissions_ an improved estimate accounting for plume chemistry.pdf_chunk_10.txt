tions reported at coastal sites (Chan, 2009; Dals√∏ren et al.,
2010; Parrish et al., 2009). Holmes et al. (2013) found that
rising ship NOx emissions since 1980 have been one of the
most important drivers of decreasing atmospheric methane
lifetime and that the wide range of modeled sensitivities to
ship emissions is one of the larger uncertainties in calculating
trends in methane lifetime. These ship emissions and impacts
on climate and air quality are projected to continue growing
