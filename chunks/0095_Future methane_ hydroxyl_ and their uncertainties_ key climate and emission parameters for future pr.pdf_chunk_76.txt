altitude, however, since the net sensitivity results from off-
setting CO and NOx effects and the NOx lifetime depends
strongly on altitude. When using the RETRO vertical distri-
bution for wildﬁre emissions in Oslo CTM3, in which 35–
45% of emissions enter the free troposphere, the τCH4×OH
sensitivity is 4 times smaller (α = 0.003). This vertical distri-
bution explains why Oslo CTM3 exhibits t he least τCH4×OH
variability in the 1997–2009 simulations (Fig. 1). Sensitiv-
