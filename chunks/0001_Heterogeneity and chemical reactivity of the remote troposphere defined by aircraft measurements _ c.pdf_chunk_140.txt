tify errors. In the UCI model, an error in the lumped alkane
formulation (averaging alkanes C3H8 and higher) did not
show up in P2018, where UCI supplied all the species, but
when the ATom data were used, the UCI model became an
outlier. Once found, this problem was readily Ô¨Åxed (hence
the current UCIZ model version). Inclusion of the F0AM
model with its extensive hydrocarbon oxidation mechanism
provided an interesting contrast with the simpler chemistry
