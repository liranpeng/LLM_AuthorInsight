ical sources such as methane oxidation.
Figure 5 shows the contribution of each tagged tracer over
the Paciﬁc Ocean from 120◦E to 110◦W, averaged over 5◦
latitude bins. Non-biomass-burning sources dominate at all
latitudes, due in part to the inclusion of CO from methane
oxidation in addition to fossil fuel sources in these tracers.
The oxidation of methane over the remote oceans contributes
to the large magnitude of “other non-BB” sources over the
