interpretable ( K = 3 ), approximately converged ( K = 50 ), and intermediate K values, only the VAE-based 
approach shows consistent performance. In the bottom plot, examining K from 2 to 50, our VAE approach 
exhibits increasing correlation coefficients close to one between symmetrized KL divergences at adjacent indices 
(K and K + 1 ), indicating robustness to clustering hyper-parameter variations. (We consider 15 different trials
