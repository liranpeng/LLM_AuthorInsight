reduce background OH and NOx and make ozone produc-
tion more NOx sensitive, which is consistent with the di-
rection of RF changes in the simulations. Our earlier work
on climate forcing from aviation NOx similarly identiÔ¨Åed
background NOx levels as a driver of model uncertainty. Al-
though emission inventories are routinely updated and im-
proved, reasonable inventories continue to differ by 10 %
for NOx and 20 % for CO at the global level; differences
