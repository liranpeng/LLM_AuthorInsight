radiation was calculated from ﬁxed 2010 trace gas mass mixing ratios and not
informed by the chemistry. This full uncoupling of the chemistry and radiation
means the driving meteorology in all simulations is identical, so that differences
between simulations are purely due to the applied changes in hydrogen or
methane. As the water vapor was ﬁxed, the change in water vapor due to changes in
hydrogen and methane was not calculated in these experiments.
