build a commensurate statistical picture of the impact of
clouds on J values using the ratio of J-cloudy (standard,
sometimes cloudy conditions) to J-clear (artiÔ¨Åcially cleared
of clouds). The range of modeled cloud effects is inconsis-
tently large but they fall into two distinct classes: (1) models
with large cloud effects showing mostly enhanced J values
aloft and or diminished at the surface and (2) models with
small effects having nearly clear-sky J values much of the
