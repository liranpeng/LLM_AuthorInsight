Testing model climatologies
The ATom data set provides a unique opportunity to test
CTMs and CCMs in a climatological sense. In this sec-
tion, we compare ATom-1 data and the six models’ chemical
statistics for mid-August used in P2017. The ATom proﬁles
cannot be easily compared point by point with CCMs, and we
use statistical measures of the three reactivities in the three
tropical basins: mean proﬁles in Fig. 3 and PDs in Fig. 5.
