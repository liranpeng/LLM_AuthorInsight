sphere of the northern extratropics during summer, largely
due to aircraft emissions as will be seen later (Fig. 5).
The relative perturbation in the upper troposphere is of the
order of 4â€“6% during January and July. However, as indi-
cated in Fig. 4 the strongest relative effect can be as large
as 16% in the northern hemisphere boundary layer during
summer. During winter the perturbation peaks at 10% and is
located in the tropical boundary layer.
