account chemical change only (“2 minus 1c”) and both chemical and climate change (“2 minus 1”). The results are based on ozone changes
calculated by the ULAQ model in its native grid extending up to 71 km altitude. When comparing with Tables 4 and 5 it has to be noted that
the results presented in Table 6 include the height range between 30 km and 71 km and that the tropopause used by ULAQ differs slightly
from that used by the UiO-RTM.
