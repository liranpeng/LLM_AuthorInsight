are very diﬀerent from each other. In contrast, the residual ﬂuxes advected by the large-scale BDC across
100 hPa remain similar.
Section 4 summarizes our results, including the obvious recommendation that more accurate methods for
diagnosing STE O3 ﬂuxes be adopted in CCMs. We demonstrate that the BD method relying solely on the
residual vertical velocity fails to characterize the magnitude and also climate variability of the ﬂux. As illus-
