to northeast-aligned transect near 50◦N and 58◦W is illus-
trated in Fig. 16. Here a ca. 200 km eddy characterized by
a 0.2 PSU freshwater anomaly was measured carrying water,
which was likely subducted in the south Atlantic, northward.
The anomaly was associated with a circulation of ∼1 ms−1
with maximum velocities near 300 m extending downward to
a depth of about 800 m. EUREC4A observations such as these
will be essential for understanding the complex dynamics of
