2-D probability densities and ﬁtted ellipses, two models
showed that longitudinal transects from 165 to 210◦E
were nearly identical, yet distinct from the other model.
The 1-D and 2-D probability distributions of key species
are sufﬁciently diverse across the models so that climatology
measurements, like those from ATom, will easily be able to
differentiate among them and likely identify speciﬁc model
discrepancies. For example, in Fig. 6a models A and E are
