Medhaug et al. (2017), have showed that temporary plateaus
are consistent with expected long-term warming due to in-
creasing atmospheric GHGs. Other analyses of the 1998–
2013 plateau illuminate the roles of unforced climate vari-
ability and natural and human-caused climate forcings in
climate change, with the Interdecadal Paciﬁc Oscillation (a
recurring pattern of ocean–atmosphere climate variability)
playing a major role in the warming slowdown (Kosaka and
