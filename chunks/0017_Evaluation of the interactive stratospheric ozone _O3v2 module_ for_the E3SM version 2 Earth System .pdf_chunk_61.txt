The interannual variability of these monthly mean pro-
ﬁles is more difﬁcult to reproduce. Here we are not trying
to match speciﬁc year-to-year changes but are calculating a
monthly latitude-by-pressure map of the 13-year record of
SD of O3 abundance in ppm at each point. The Taylor dia-
gram for these data (Fig. 3c) shows that all models become
worse than they did for the climatological mean, speciﬁcally
with smaller correlations and smaller RMSE. The obvious
