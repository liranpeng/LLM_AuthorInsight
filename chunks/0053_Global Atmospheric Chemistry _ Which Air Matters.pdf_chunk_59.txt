ally include self-evaluated ozone and aerosol proÔ¨Åles also
needed for the photolysis rates. Third, these models automat-
ically simulate the diurnal cycle in radiation at all seasons,
latitudes, and longitudes. And fourth, most importantly, these
models have built-in chemistry modules that already calcu-
late reactivities, and they are the ones we rely on for climate
and air quality assessments. The goal here is to test their sim-
ulated chemical heterogeneity. While a box model could be
