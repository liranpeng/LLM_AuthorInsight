(Oâ€™Connor et al., 2010), but as yet there is little evidence
for a substantial increase in emissions from hydrates or per-
mafrost either now or over the last 1 000 000 years (Berchet
et al., 2016; Warwick et al., 2016; Quiquet et al., 2015).
Schwietzke et al. (2016) use isotopic constraints to show
that the fossil fuel contribution to atmospheric CH4 is larger
than previously believed, but total fossil fuel CH4 emis-
sions are not increasing. This conclusion is consistent with
