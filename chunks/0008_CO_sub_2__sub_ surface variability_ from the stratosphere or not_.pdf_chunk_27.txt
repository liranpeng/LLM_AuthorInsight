analysis that stratosphereâ€“troposphere exchange, which does
drive an annual cycle in N2O, can produce a detectable an-
nual cycle in CO2 above the large observed cycle.
The observed QBO signal in surface N2O (Ruiz et al.,
2021, Fig. 3) has the largest amplitude in the SH extrat-
ropics, becoming weaker in the tropics and NH. Because
this signal is nearly uniform across the SH extratropics in
both observations and models, I combine the SPO and CGO
