ships (CTDs, underway CTDs, mounted vessel proﬁlers, mi-
crostructure proﬁlers, XBTs, XCTDs, Doppler current meter
proﬁlers, ﬁve BGC Argo ﬂoats) and the seven underwater
gliders (e.g., Fig. 5) proﬁled water properties and ocean cur-
rents. This array of measurements, guided by near-real-time
satellite data and real-time ship proﬁling, revealed a surpris-
ingly dense and diverse distribution of mesoscale eddies. All
of the measured eddies captured by satellite data (Fig. 16)
