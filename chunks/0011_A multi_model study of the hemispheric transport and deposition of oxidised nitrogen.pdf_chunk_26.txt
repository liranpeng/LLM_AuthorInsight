NOy in the receptor region divided by the size of the
perturbation of NOx emissions in the source region, which
we define to be the ‘‘sensitivity’’. Although the absolute
change in the deposition of NOy in a receptor region will
depend on the size of the emission perturbation, the sensi-
tivity will be independent of the emission perturbation,
assuming a linear response from the models. The annual
and seasonal mean sensitivities for each receptor region
