emissions mitigation along with and cases for large GHG reduc-
tions, including removal of atmospheric CO2. For all of these
scenarios, the relative role of HFCs in global warming by 2100 is
projected to increase from <1% to values from 3% to 6%. These
numbers are much lower than the 2050 numbers (e.g., 9–19% by
emission) used by Velders et al. (2009). A larger effect of HFC
reductions (28–45%) is often reported; however, this fraction
