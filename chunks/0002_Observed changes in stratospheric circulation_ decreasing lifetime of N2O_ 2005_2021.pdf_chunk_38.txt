certain). We present clear observational evidence support-
ing the models of what is likely a climate-change-driven in-
crease in the net BDC using a major trace gas. N2O abun-
dances in the tropical upper stratosphere are increasing at
rates much faster than tropospheric abundances, but this pat-
tern cannot distinguish between more rapid ascent or reduced
mixing with extra-tropical latitudes. The latter would imply
a slower growth rate for extra-tropical N2O, but this is not
