The RHw PDs are quite different from the chemical
species. RHw has a bimodal distribution for the tropical re-
gions with a narrow peak probability below 10 % RHw and
a broad maximum of about 80 % RHw. Thus, RHw clearly
distinguishes between two types of tropical air masses re-
ﬂecting the Hadley cell: a humid, generally upwelling trop-
ical air mass and a dry descending subtropical air mass. As
for other species and reactivities, the eastern Paciﬁc RHw is
