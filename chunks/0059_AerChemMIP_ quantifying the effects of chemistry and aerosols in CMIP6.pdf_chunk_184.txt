air quality.
A focus is on comparing the climate responses (both
global and regional) to the heterogeneous forcing patterns
generated by changes in emissions of NTCFs and their pre-
cursors over the historical period and in future scenarios. The
future scenarios consist of a pair differing only in their lev-
els of ambition in air quality policy. The results from these
will provide information on the impacts of air quality poli-
cies on climate. The forcings are characterised by the ERFs
