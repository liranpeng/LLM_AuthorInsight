(84◦S to 84◦N), 37 pressure levels (100–0.001 hPa), and 209
months (August 2004 to December 2021).
The observational data consist of 8987 independent col-
umn atmospheres. The top level (0.001 hPa) is high enough
that only a single layer of thickness 0.001 hPa with the same
properties as the top layer is added to complete the atmo-
sphere for the radiative calculation. Below 100 hPa, we add
six layers with typical tropospheric values (320 ppt); how-
