TRAN (Rozanov et al., 2014). However, these more accurate
reference codes have always been viewed as too computa-
tionally expensive. In terms of climate model development,
this is a solved problem with little intellectual interest but is
too onerous to improve, and thus low-order approximations
remain in place.
We present here Solar-J version 7.5, a radiative trans-
fer model based on the computationally optimized photol-
ysis code, Cloud-J (Prather, 2015). Cloud-J combined an im-
