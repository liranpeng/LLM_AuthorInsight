are low for all variables (e.g. radiative flux biases are at most 1.2 W/m2) but they are mostly larger
compared to the baseline simulation. In particular the approximately -25 Pa ps bias is large compared
to the near-zero bias in the baseline simulation which exactly conserves global dry air mass and
moisture.
Figure 9 shows the timeseries of the global mean for all output variables. Most variables track
