involving clouds. Three-dimensional ﬁelds of mass mixing
ratios and column integrated optical thickness for aerosol
species allow tracking of the extent to which perturbations
are present. For gaseous pollutants ozone molar mixing ra-
tios and methane lifetime are requested in order to diagnose

Tracking the anthropogenic fraction of column loads
would require additional tracers. For a ﬁrst-order analy-
