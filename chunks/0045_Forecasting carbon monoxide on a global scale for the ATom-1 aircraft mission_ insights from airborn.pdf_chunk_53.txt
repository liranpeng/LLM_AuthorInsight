tainty. In addition, plumes in models tend to dissipate more
quickly than in observations due to the numerical effects of
limited model resolution (Eastham and Jacob, 2017).
The non-BB contribution to CO in the Atlantic reﬂects
a mixture of global sources. Asian sources make a no-
table contribution to the non-BB CO variability in the trop-
ics (ﬁrst half of the Ascension Island–Azores ﬂight), but
