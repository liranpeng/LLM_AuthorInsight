scattered parcels (> 3 ppb/d) below 5 km down to 20◦S.
High L-O3 and L-CH4 coincide with this 20–22◦N air mass
and also with some high P-O3 at lower latitudes. This pattern
of overlapping extremes in all three Rs is surprising because
the models’ mid-Paciﬁc climatologies show a separation be-
tween regions of high L-O3 (lower-middle troposphere) and
high P-O3 (upper troposphere, as seen in P2017’s Fig. 3).
The obvious explanation is that the models leave most of the
