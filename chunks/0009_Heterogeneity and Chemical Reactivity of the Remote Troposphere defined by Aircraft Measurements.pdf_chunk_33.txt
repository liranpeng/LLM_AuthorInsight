tropospheric chemistry. The major model differences lie in
the ﬁrst step because when we specify the mix of key chemi-
cal species, most models agree on the CH4 and O3 chemical
budgets (P2018). The intent of ATom was to collect an at-
mospheric sampling of all the key species and the statistics
deﬁning their spatial variability and thus that of the reactivi-
ties of CH4 and O3.
