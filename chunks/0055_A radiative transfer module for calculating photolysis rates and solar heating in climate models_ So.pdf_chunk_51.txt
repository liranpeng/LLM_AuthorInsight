re = 9.6 µm at pressures greater than 810 hPa and increasing
linearly to 12.7 µm at 610 hPa and above. When implemented
in an atmospheric model, re will ideally be supplied by the
atmospheric model driving Solar-J.
Heating rates and the changes in the radiative energy bud-
get due to clouds are evaluated with the clear-sky component
subtracted. In both Solar-J and RRTMG-SW, when re and
