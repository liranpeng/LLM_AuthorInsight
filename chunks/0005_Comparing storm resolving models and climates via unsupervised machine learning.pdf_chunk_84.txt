encoded with a shared VAE (trained on UM data). The left column (panels a–c; see also S5–S7) shows data 
points colorized by physical convection properties, including convection intensity (a), land fraction (b), and 
turbulent length scale (c). The VAE visibly disentangles all three properties. The right columns (panels d–i) 
show data points from different DYAMOND data sets, colorized by convection type (as found by clustering).
