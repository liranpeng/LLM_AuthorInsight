siders about 32 reactive gases, whereas GC and GMI have
over 100, and F0AM has more than 600. The other major
difference across models is photolysis, with models having
different cloud data and different methods for calculating
photolysis rates in cloudy atmospheres (H2018). The three
central models (GC, GMI, UCI) in terms of their 5 d vari-
ability (Table S9) are also most closely alike in these statis-
tics, with rms = 20 %–30 % for L-CH4 up to 26 %–35 % for
