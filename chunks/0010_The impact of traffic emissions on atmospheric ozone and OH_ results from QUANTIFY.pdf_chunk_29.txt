sil fuel related emissions. The mass of NMHCs given in
kg(NMHC)/yr was converted to kg(C)/year using a ratio of
161/210 TgC/Tg(NMHC) for mass(Carbon)/mass(NMHC-
molecule) as in the third IPCC assessment report.
The
speciﬁc ratios were then applied to calculate the individual
NMHC partitioning.

emission of NMHCs from biomass burning and fossil fuel combus-
tion in QUANTIFY (von Kuhlmann et al., 2003a,b).
