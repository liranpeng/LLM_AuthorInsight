coherently increases with predictions error. The proposed
MF parameterization approach can also be combined with
explainable AI techniques to further study similarities and
discrepancies between different Earth system models.
The multifidelity-RPN performance is due to the modelâ€™s
design (architecture accounting for data distribution shift) and
to its optimal aggregation of different datasets of different
fidelity levels. This latter property allows the MF model to
