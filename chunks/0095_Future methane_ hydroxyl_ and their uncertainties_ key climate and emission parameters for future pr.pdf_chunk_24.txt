and some other physical process algorithms with the older
Oslo CTM2, which has been extensively used for studies of
present and future tropospheric composition (Isaksen et al.,

UCI CTM
The UCI CTM is a tropospheric CTM, using the same mete-
orology, transport algorithms, and Fast-JX photolysis as Oslo
CTM3. Like Oslo CTM3, the UCI CTM uses T42 horizontal
