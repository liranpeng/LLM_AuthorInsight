lower bound of the KL Divergence. Panels (c–f) are intermediate K values. To better highlight the structure, we 
apply agglomerative clustering to the ­columns26 and symmetrize the rows. Regardless of the selected K value, 
the ultimate results are similar, particuarly for K > 20. We find dynamical consistency between six of the nine 
GSRMs we examine (6 × 6 light red sub-region corresponding to NICAM, IFS, GEM, SHIELD, ARPEGE, UM), 
which is in agreement with panel (a).
