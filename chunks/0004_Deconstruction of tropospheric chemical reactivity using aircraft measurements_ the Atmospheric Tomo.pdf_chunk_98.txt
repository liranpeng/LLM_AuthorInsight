value, with a secondary peak above 1 ppb d−1. The very low
values of L-CH4 simply reﬂect the sampling of the upper tro-
posphere, where the OH + CH4 rate coefﬁcient proportional
to exp(−1775/T ) is very small. Thus, the L-CO PD, which
is also proportional to OH, peaks at higher values. Restrict-
ing our PDs to the three tropical regions (Figs. 44–47), we
ﬁnd some distinct deployments (e.g., low P-O3 in the central
Paciﬁc for ATom-1, high P-O3 in the tropical Atlantic for
