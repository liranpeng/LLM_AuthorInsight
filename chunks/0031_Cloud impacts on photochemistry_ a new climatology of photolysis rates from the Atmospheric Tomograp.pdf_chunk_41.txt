b Briegleb’s method (1992) approximates maximum-random overlap with a single-column atmosphere and adjusted effective cloud fraction such that the cloud optical depth in
the grid cell is COD(in-cell) = COD(in-cloud) × CF3/2.
tures within a grid square, the approach needed to match in-
dividual CAFS Js.
The CAFS data were collected from ATom-1 during its
10 research ﬂights from 29 July to 23 August 2016. It was
not possible for the models to simulate each ﬂight path, in-
