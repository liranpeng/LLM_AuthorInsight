Abstract
Existing ML-based atmospheric models are not suitable for climate prediction,
which requires long-term stability and physical consistency. We present ACE (AI2
Climate Emulator), a 200M-parameter, autoregressive machine learning emulator
of an existing comprehensive 100-km resolution global atmospheric model. The
formulation of ACE allows evaluation of physical laws such as the conservation
