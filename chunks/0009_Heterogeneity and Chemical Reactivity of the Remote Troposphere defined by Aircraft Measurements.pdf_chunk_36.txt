statistics (mean, median, quartiles) but only compared with
the modeled means. The HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations
(HIPPO) aircraft mission (Wofsy, 2011) was a precursor to
ATom with regular proﬁling of the mid-Paciﬁc including
high-frequency 10 s sampling that identiﬁed the small scales
of variability throughout the troposphere. HIPPO measure-
ments were limited in species, lacking O3, NOx and many
