The most rigorous approach in this intercomparison, in
terms of area approximation, is the Simpliﬁed Flux-Form
CSLAM scheme (SFF-CSLAM, Lauritzen et al., 2011a; Ull-
rich et al., 2013). For each cell the ﬂux areas are approxi-
mated by tracing the end points (vertices) of each cell face
upstream. The upstream translation of these points and the
face vertices can be connected with straight lines (e.g., Harris
et al., 2010) or parabola (in the latter case also the midpoint
