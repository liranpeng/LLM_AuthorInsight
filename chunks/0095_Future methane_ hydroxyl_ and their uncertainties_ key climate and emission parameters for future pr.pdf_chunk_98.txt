burning emissions follow CMIP5 recommendations (Lamar-
que et al., 2010; Meinshausen et al., 2011b). Global annual
lightning ﬂash rates have varied by up to 20 % since 1998, but
multi-decadal trends are not apparent (Murray et al., 2012),
so we assume no change since 1980, with 10 % Gaussian un-
certainty in the trend.
Figure 5 shows the reconstructed historical changes in
τCH4×OH and the contribution to those changes from each
climate and emission variable. We assess uncertainty in
