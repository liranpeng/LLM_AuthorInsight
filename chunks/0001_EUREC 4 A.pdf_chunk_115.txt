thal, 1982; Cooper et al., 2013; Li et al., 2018; PÃ¶hlker et al.,
2018; Wyszogrodzki et al., 2013). In most cases, not only the
magnitude, but also the sign of the hypothesized effects can
be ambiguous, if not controversial. For example, by acting
as an additional source of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN),
Saharan dust may retard the formation of precipitation (Levin
et al., 1996; Gibson et al., 2007; Bailey et al., 2013), but if
