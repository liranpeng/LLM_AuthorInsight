Ice-water and liquid-water clouds have real refractive indices
that differ by at most 5 %, and imaginary refractive indices
that differ typically by a factor of 2 (except for S27). The
cause of this difference in speciÔ¨Åc absorption is the ratio of
mass (which controls absorption) to surface area (which con-
trols optical depth), i.e., it is proportional to re, and ice-water
clouds typically have 4 times greater re.
