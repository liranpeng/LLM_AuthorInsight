trations in the free troposphere (−2 to −12 % at 400 hPa)
but more widespread increases (2–7 %) in annual-mean CO-
tracer mixing ratios near the surface that extend from the
Equator to the northern mid-latitudes. Since the same emis-
sion data are used in both studies, this difference is likely to
arise from differences in CO-tracer lifetime used as well as
model differences in representing shallow convection and/or
advection processes.
Future CO-tracer mixing ratios also increase substantially
