for J-O1D, MOCA for J-NO2), and these differences carry
through to J-cloudy (Fig. 1). A most important factor in J-
O1D is the O3 column, and Fig. S3 shows the modeled O3
columns for
August compared with 8 years of OMI ob-
servations. MOCA, NCAR, and IFS have low tropical O3
columns, < 250 DU vs. observed ∼265 DU, which could
lead to higher J-O1D, but this effect is seen only in MOCA.
