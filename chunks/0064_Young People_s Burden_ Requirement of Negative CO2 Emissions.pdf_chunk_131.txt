are tabulated in Appendix A10.
We use equilibrium fast-feedback climate sensitivity
0.75 ◦C (W m−2)−1 (3 ◦C for 2 × CO2). This is consistent
with climate models (Collins et al., 2013: Flato et al., 2013)
and paleoclimate evidence (Rohling et al., 2012a; Masson-
Delmotte et al., 2013; Bindoff and Stott, 2013). We use
RCP6.0 for the non-CO2 GHGs.
We take tropospheric aerosol plus surface albedo forcing
as −1.2 W m−2 in 2015, presuming the aerosol and albedo
