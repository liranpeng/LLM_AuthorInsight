and decline of atmospheric methyl chloroform (MCF) since
the 1970s (ALE/GAGE/AGAGE, Prinn et al., 2005), with ex-
panded coverage since the 1990s (NOAA, Montzka et al.,
2000). Like methane, atmospheric MCF is oxidized mainly
by tropospheric OH, with small additional sinks in the strato-
sphere, oceans, and soil (Volk et al., 1997; Wennberg et
al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008). Because MCF has no natu-
ral sources and the anthropogenic production is well known
