The “hot” air parcels
Following the “which air matters” theme of P2017, we look
at the more reactive air parcels to ﬁnd out if the models agree
on these. For each reactivity, we sort the 5-day parcel means
in increasing order and integrate the cumulative reactivity.
The value at 100 % (all 14 880 parcels) is equal to the average
reactivity of the sample (Table 3a), and this is renormalized
to 1 for comparison across models (Fig. 4, Table S4). With
