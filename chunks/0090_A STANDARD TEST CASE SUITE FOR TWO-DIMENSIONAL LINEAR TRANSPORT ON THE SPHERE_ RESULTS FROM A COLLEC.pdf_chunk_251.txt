initial condition)
For inﬁnitely smooth initial conditions, convergence data are
examined in the resolution range [3◦, 0.3◦]. This range was
deliberately chosen so that the ﬁelds may only be marginally
resolved at the low resolution end of this resolution range.
It was observed how different schemes converge throughout
the resolution range at their formal convergence rate and how
other schemes reach asymptotic convergence rates at higher
