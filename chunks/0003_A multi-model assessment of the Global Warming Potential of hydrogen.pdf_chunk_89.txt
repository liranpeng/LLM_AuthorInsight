the lifetime of the emitted species50,51. This is because when a constant emission
perturbation has reached steady state, it contains perturbations from pulses of all
ages at one time. The pulse integration result is equal to a simple comparison
between forcing changes per burden change in steady state runs with control and
constant emission changes scaled with the emitted species lifetime.
