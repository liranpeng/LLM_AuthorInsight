Figure 6. Two-dimensional curtain plots (altitude–latitude proﬁling) of P-O3 (ppb d−1) in the Paciﬁc basin (53◦S–60◦N) for ATom-1234.
In all these curtain plots, ATom 10 s parcel data are weighted by cosine (latitude) and sampling frequency, and then they are averaged into 1◦
latitude and 200 m altitude bins.
