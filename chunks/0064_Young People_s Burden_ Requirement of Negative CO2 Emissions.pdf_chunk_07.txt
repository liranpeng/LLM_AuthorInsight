from the air. If phasedown of fossil fuel emissions begins soon, improved agricultural and forestry practices,
including reforestation and steps to improve soil fertility and increase its carbon content, may provide much of
the necessary CO2 extraction. In that case, the magnitude and duration of global temperature excursion above the
natural range of the current interglacial (Holocene) could be limited and irreversible climate impacts could be
