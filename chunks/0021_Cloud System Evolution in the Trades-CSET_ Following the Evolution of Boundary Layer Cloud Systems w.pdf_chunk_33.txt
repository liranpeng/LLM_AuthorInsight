entire transition. By resampling the same boundary-layer air masses on the return flights as 
the outbound flights, the measurements can naturally be compared with the Lagrangian LES 
and SCM simulations that have proved to be valuable for constructing and analyzing better 
models of MBL cloud and its sensitivity to environmental conditions.
Based on this background, the following scientific goals were set for CSET:
