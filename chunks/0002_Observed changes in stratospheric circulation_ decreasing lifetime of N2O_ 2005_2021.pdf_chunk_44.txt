change in CFC and N2O atmospheric lifetimes with climate
change (year 2100 versus 2000). For the ﬁve chemistry–
climate models that calculated the N2O lifetime, results were
ambiguous: two increased, one decreased, and two were un-
changed, all with absolute changes of less than 0.5 %/decade.
These results are not necessarily inconsistent with the pro-
jections here because the modeled scenarios included other
chemical changes in the stratosphere and adopted a middling
