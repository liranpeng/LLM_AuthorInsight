issue. Emerging opportunities for more benign refrigerants are
identified in the critical review, along with some of the draw-
backs of these new substances.
Stratospheric Chemistry and the
Importance of Nitrous Oxide (N2O)
The stratospheric chemistry of ODSs requires elaboration
(Dessler, 2000; Solomon, 1999) beyond that presented in critical
review, especially for the role of nitrous oxide (N2O) in O3
depletion (Fleming et al., 2011; Ravishankara et al., 2009;
