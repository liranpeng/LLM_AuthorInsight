well as in the relationship between photolysis and these reac-
tivities. Unique, possibly aberrant, features are identiÔ¨Åed for
each model, providing a benchmark for photochemical mod-
ule development. Among the six models tested here, three
are almost indistinguishable based on the inherent variability
caused by clouds, and thus we identify four, effectively dis-
tinct, chemical models. Based on this work, we suggest that
