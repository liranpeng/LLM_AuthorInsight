systematic biases than coarse-resolution or established regional
simulations12,13, and current data tends to cover short periods of
time. Such datasets are also massive, difficult to transfer between
data centers and frequently not produced on machines attached to
significant AI computing resources like Graphical Processing Units
(GPUs).
In contrast, for regional simulation, using ML to conditionally
generate km-scales is attractive. High-quality training data are
