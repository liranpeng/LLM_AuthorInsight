to a larger radiative forcing amounting to 0.68 Wm−2.
The comparison of the UiO-RTM results with the ULAQ-
RTM and UoR-RTM results points to some disagreement,
which is due to different assumptions on the meteorologi-
cal conditions and, in the case of ULAQ-RTM the different
height range considered in the stratosphere. The radiative
forcing calculations made by the Harvard-GISS “standard”
model agree rather well with those based on the modeled
