ing in a weaker (negative) LW signal. Upward transport of
the tropospheric ozone increase contributes to this effect by
moving the boundary between ozone increase and ozone de-
crease upwards, thus making the net radiative forcing less
negative or even slightly positive in low latitudes. Tropo-
spheric ozone change thus affects global-mean stratospheric
radiative forcing, which points to the importance of tropo-
spheric chemistry also in assessments of radiative forcing
