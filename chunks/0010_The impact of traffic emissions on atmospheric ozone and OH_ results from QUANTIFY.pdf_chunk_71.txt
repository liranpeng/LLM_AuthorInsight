the southern hemisphere (see also Fig. 6).
Note furthermore that the effects of trafﬁc emissions over
the Paciﬁc and Indian Ocean downwind of the densly popu-
lated coastal areas and sources of pollution, are not as strong
as over the central Atlantic Ocean. A comparison with the
NOx emission distribution (Fig. 1) indicates that over the
northern hemispheric Atlantic in particular ship trafﬁc and
also aircraft emit large amounts of NOx and that these strong
