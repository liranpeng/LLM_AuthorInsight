gesting that continued high fossil fuel emissions might drive
2 â—¦C soil warming and a 55 PgC soil carbon loss by 2050. Al-
though this analysis admits large uncertainty, such large soil
carbon loss could wreak havoc with efforts to achieve the net
soil and biospheric carbon storage that is likely necessary for
climate stabilization, as we discuss in subsequent sections.
Recent changes of GHGs result mainly from industrial and
agricultural emissions, but they also include any existing cli-
