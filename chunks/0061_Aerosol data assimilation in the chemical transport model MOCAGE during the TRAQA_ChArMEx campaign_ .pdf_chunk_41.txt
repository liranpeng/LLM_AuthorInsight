et al. (2011) approach, the problem of minimization of the
cost function is better determined: the 2-D AOD observations
constrain one 3-D variable as the unknown, compared to 24
3-D variables as unknowns in the Liu et al. (2011) approach.
The matrix B does not have to be deﬁned for all bins sepa-
rately, nor does it need to contain the inter-bin covariances.
Nevertheless, in order to linearize the observation operator,
it is necessary to decide how the analysis increment δxa will
