the high AOD values in the model. This directly affects the
analyses, and is later reﬂected in the forecasts.
To regulate this feature, one of the possible and the sim-
plest (ad hoc) approaches would be to limit the observa-
tion error in the matrix R up to a ﬁxed value, which would
give more weight to observations in the case of high ob-
served AOD. This would have a partial effect, only inﬂuenc-
ing observations above a certain AOD, and in the case of
