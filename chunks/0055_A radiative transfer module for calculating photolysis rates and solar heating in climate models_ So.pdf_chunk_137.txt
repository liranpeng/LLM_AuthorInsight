properties, and approximation of the multitude of indepen-
dent column atmospheres (ICAs) resulting from a complex
overlapping cloud Ô¨Åeld within a grid cell. What is a rea-
sonable requirement for multi-stream scattering in a climate
model? From this work as well as a history of publications
noted above, the analytic two-stream approximation has er-
rors that cannot simply be corrected or averaged over, that
create large-scale biases in cloud radiative forcing with lati-
