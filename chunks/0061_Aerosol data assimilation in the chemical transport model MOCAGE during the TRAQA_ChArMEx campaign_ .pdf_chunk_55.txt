the errors is difﬁcult to do. Therefore, we carried out several
test runs to determine optimal parameters for the matrices a
posteriori. As the optimal parameters, we estimated that the
percentage for the errors of the model should be twice as
large as for the observations (24 and 12 % respectively).
Missing secondary aerosols in MOCAGE are considered
