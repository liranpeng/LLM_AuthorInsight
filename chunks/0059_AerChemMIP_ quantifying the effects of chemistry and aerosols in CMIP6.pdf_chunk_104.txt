Transient future prescribed SST simulations
As for the historical experiments (Sect. 3.1), the above sce-
narios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF) are repeated with
prescribed SSTs. These SSTs (and sea ice) are taken from
the monthly mean evolving values from one of the ensemble
members of the coupled ssp370 run. The differences in ra-
