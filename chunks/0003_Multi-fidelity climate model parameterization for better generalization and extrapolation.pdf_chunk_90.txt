between the training and testing high-fidelity data, based only
on information of the computationally cheaper but valuable
(for extrapolation) low-fidelity training data. Distributions
of the normalized test data using statistics from CAM5 +8K
and SPCAM5 historical runs confirm the physically-based
motivation of using the former dataset for MF-RPN normal-
ization as detailed above (table 1). Indeed, the normalized
test data based on the CAM5 +8K statistics shows variables
