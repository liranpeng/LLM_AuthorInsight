auxiliary data. AI on top goes well beyond emulation to enable
interactivity across disparate sources of data, e.g., to create new
types of models and to give salience to the use of data. This is the
game changer. One lesson of recent applications of generative AI is
the disproportionate benefit of larger (AI) models trained on larger
and more diverse data. This requires a very large computing
capacity for both training and creating the training data. It means
