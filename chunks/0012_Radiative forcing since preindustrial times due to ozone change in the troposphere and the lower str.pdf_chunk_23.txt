in the troposphere and the lower stratosphere.
The main
idea and novelty is to include both tropospheric and strato-
spheric chemistry and to account for climate change, includ-
ing couplings between chemistry and climate, in a multi-
model study. Time-slice model simulations have been carried
out for the years 1850 and 2000, yielding ozone change that
is taken as input for detailed radiative transfer calculations.
The applied models greatly differ in transport and chemistry
