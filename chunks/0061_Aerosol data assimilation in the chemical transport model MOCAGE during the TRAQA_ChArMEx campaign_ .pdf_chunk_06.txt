output. The best results as expected occur when the shape of
the vertical proﬁle is correctly simulated by the direct model.
We also examine how the assimilation can inﬂuence the mod-
elled aerosol vertical distribution. The results show that a 2-
D continuous AOD assimilation can improve the 3-D verti-
cal proﬁle, as a result of differential horizontal transport of
aerosols in the model.
