ﬂuence cloud vertical development, may affect the efﬁciency
of warm-rain production. In addition to the characterization
of the environment from the dropsondes, the positioning of
surface measurements (R/V Meteor, R/V Ron Brown, and
BCO) helped characterize the Lagrangian evolution of the
ﬂow, also in terms of aerosol and cloud properties.
Figure 11 shows an example of the cascade of measure-
ments, spanning scales covering 10 orders of magnitude.
