Methane lifetime
Relative changes in methane lifetime due to reaction with
OH are presented in Table 3 (see Table A1 for results from
individual models) for perturbations in each transport sec-
tor and each year. Monthly mean CH4 and OH ﬁelds were
used for the calculation, and the resulting lifetime changes
were scaled from a 5 % perturbation to a 100 % perturba-
tion by multiplying with a factor of 20 (Grewe et al., 2010).
