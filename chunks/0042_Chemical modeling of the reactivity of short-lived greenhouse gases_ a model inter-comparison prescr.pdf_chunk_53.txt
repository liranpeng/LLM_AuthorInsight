differences, with greatest ﬁrst and smallest last. Here we can
clearly see the type of scatter, the pattern of discrepancies
across models, and at what levels of reactivity such discrep-

UCI should reexamine its J-NO2 at the higher values and
its P -O3 in the 1–3 ppb day−1 range; NCAR should examine
