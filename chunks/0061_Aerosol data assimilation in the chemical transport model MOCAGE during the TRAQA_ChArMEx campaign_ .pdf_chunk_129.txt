1 h forecast (ﬁrst guess) started from the assimilated conditions of 1 h before (dashed red line). The aerosols are considered in the size range
from 2.5 to 100 µm. In addition, for the third ﬂight, we present the 12 h back trajectories obtained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration’s HYSPLIT model (d). They show directions of the origin of air parcels at the three different starting heights, 200, 1300 and
