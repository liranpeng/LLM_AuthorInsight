or an algorithm is needed to describe exactly how the cloud is distributed within the grid cell and how the 
cells overlap. Most climate models do not resolve the horizontal scale of clouds and simply report a cloud 
water column and fractional coverage in the cell. A typical algorithm is MAX-RAN (Briegleb,Â 1992): the 
cloud is assumed to be uniform in the cloudy fraction of the cell; when two adjacent vertical layers have
