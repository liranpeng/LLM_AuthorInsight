terpolation). We expect GC and GMI to be alike since they
both use MERRA-2 cloud ﬁelds and Fast-J with Briegleb
averaging: indeed, they match well except for J-O1D in
the tropical Paciﬁc, yet, they report similar tropical ozone
columns.
The ratio of J-cloudy to J-clear, shown in Fig. 3, cancels
out many of the model differences in Figs. 1 and 2, and as ex-
pected GC and GMI are nearly identical. The cloudy : clear
ratio identiﬁes new patterns in model differences, whereby
