tiÔ¨Åed the problem with PSS-NOx. We had gathered enough
information on how models agree, or disagree, with RDS-0
and thus chose to assess MDS-1 with two of the models that
closely agreed (GMI and UCI). The two models were very
close in RDS-0 and also in RDS-1. We then found the prob-
lems with the CO proxy and chose to use only the UCI model
as a transfer standard for the change from MDS-1 to MDS-2
(i.e., RDS-1 to RDS-2). This path avoided much extra work
