higher temperatures. Hence, the CAM5 +8K was chosen as
low-fidelity model for extrapolation (Methods).
Since we are interested in extrapolating beyond the training
data, the test data is constructed by considering the CESM
SPCAM5 +4K simulation. In order to enhance the extrapola-
tion evaluation to unseen data, the testing dataset corresponds
to a full year of the +4K simulation, resulting in a final test
dataset of roughly 121.1 M points (Methods). Beyond global
