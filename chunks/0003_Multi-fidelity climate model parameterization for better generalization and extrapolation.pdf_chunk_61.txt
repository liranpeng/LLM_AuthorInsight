model is intrinsically capable of estimating its predictions ac-
curacy across different test data points. We also verify that the
longitude-latitude structure of the uncertainty well matches
with the longitude-latitude variation of the predictions error,
with the highest values being observed around the tropics
where the inherent stochasticity of convection is the highest
compared to other regions (figure 13).
Discussion
Extrapolation beyond training datasets is a long-standing prob-
