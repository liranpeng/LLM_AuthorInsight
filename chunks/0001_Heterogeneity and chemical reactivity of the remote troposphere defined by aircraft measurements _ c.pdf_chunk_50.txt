vational data indicative of industrial or biomass burning pol-
lution or atmospheric processing (HCN, CH3CN, SF6, rela-
tive humidity, aerosol surface area (four modes), and cloud
indicator). We choose 10 s averages for our air parcels as a
compromise and because the 10 s merged data are a standard
product (Wofsy et al., 2018). A few instruments measure at
1 s intervals, but the variability at this scale is not that differ-
ent from 10 s averages (Fig. S2). Most of the key species are
