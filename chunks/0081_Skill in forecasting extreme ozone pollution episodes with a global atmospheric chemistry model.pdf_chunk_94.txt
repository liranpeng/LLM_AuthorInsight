four grid cells, and ﬁlled circles denote the AQX events at
each site. For comparison with the UCI CTM hindcast, we
take the 20 worst days in years 2005–2006. Thus, over the
2 years, both CTM and observations have 20 AQX events
in each grid cell. This deﬁnition of AQX highlights times at
each grid cell when O3 pollution is at its highest, generally
when the effect of nearby precursor emissions is exacerbated
by meteorology. Indeed, Lei et al. (2012) highlight the need
