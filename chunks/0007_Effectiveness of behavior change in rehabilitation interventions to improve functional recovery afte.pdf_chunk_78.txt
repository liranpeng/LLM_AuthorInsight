combining operative and non-operatively treated populations 
[24]. Future studies using BCTs to promote early movement 
should look carefully at the risk of wound healing compli-
cations and consider including additional BCTs to enable 
monitoring, detection and avoidance of these complications.
The systematic review has used a comprehensive tax-
onomy to identify and code BCTs [13]. This will enable 
faithful replication of the behavioural components of the
