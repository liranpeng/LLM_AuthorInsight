the relative importance of different greenhouse gases and
aerosols to climate. Connected with the absorption of solar
SW radiation and the absorption and emission of LW radia-
tion, reductions in lower stratospheric ozone imply a positive
SW and a negative LW radiative forcing, while tropospheric
ozone increases lead to a positive radiative forcing in both
the SW and LW spectral regions. Several publications have
established the strong dependence of radiative forcing on the
