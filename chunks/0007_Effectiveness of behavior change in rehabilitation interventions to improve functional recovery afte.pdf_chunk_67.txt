Discussion
There was low-certainty evidence from six studies [22, 23, 
26, 28] that the use of BCTs did not significantly impact 
patient-reported functional outcomes after ankle fracture. 
Two of these studies [23, 28] also found that the use of 
BCTs did not significantly impact participant’s quality of 
life after ankle fracture. Nilsson 2009 [26] reported that 
subjects under 40 years in the intervention group scored a 
higher OMAS score than those above 40 years (P = 0.028).
