scribed data in the 1 and 1c scenarios.
The two feedbacks that were apparent in the study of
Stevenson et al. (2005) are increased water vapor, reducing
ozone, especially in the remote tropical lower troposphere,
and enhanced STE, increasing ozone. Increased water va-
por resulting from tropospheric warming results in higher
levels of OH and HO2, which are important ozone deplet-
ing agents in the troposphere. Furthermore, the additional
OH increases HNO3 formation and reduces NOx, an ozone
