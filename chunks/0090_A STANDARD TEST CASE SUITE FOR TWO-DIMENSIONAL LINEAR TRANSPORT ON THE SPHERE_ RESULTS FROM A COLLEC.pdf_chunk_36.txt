balanced by the outﬂow through the face shared by the neigh-
boring control volume. Hence any reasonable approximation
to the ﬂux will trivially lead to conservation of tracer mass.
There are several approaches to approximating the ﬂux di-
vergence, and they are discussed in separate sub-sections be-
low in the context of the schemes that participated in this in-
tercomparison project. Before that, however, we brieﬂy dis-
cuss the coupling between air and tracer mass that is inherent
