Using machine learning (ML) for the online correction of coarse‐resolution atmospheric models has proven effective in reducing biases in near‐surface temperature and precipitation rate. However, ML corrections often introduce new biases in the upper atmosphere and causes inconsistent model performance across different random seeds. Furthermore, they produce profiles that are outside the distribution of samples used in training, which can interfere with the baseline physics of the atmospheric
