sea level response to temperature change. Thus, we examine
the modern period with near-global instrumental temperature
data in the context of the current and prior (Holocene and
Eemian) interglacial periods, for which less precise proxy-
based temperatures have recently emerged. The Holocene,
over 11 700 years in duration, had relatively stable climate,
prior to the remarkable warming in the past half century. The
Eemian, which lasted from about 130 000 to 115 000 years
