3D model results provides the most useful priors.
In terms of deriving the change in methane loss frequency, one
can prefer the most straightforward result, that is, that the decay
rate of MCF (Fig. 1C) is simply a measure of the change in OH loss
frequency. This Occamâ€™s razor principle (lex parsimoniae) has the
fewest assumptions and makes it more readily tested and falsified.
What assumptions are needed for this MCF decay to include
larger changes in the OH loss frequency than those observed
