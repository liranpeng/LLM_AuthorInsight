1994) and N2O (Nevison et al., 2007). Sometimes SMO is
synchronous with the SH extratropics (CGO and SPO, which
are almost always synchronous with each other) and at other
times it links with MLO and the NH. Thus, to use SMO CO2
as a metric for carbon cycle models, one must recognize that
SMO is not simply representative of the SH tropics. When
evaluating carbon cycle models, one should test tracer trans-
port using the IAV for SMO versus SPO+CGO. As shown
