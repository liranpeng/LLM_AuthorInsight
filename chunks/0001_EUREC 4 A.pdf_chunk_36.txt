of scales.
Initially EUREC4A was proposed as a way to test hypoth-
esized cloud-feedback mechanisms thought to explain large
differences in model estimates of climate sensitivity, as well
as to provide benchmark measurements for a new genera-
tion of models and satellite observations (Bony et al., 2017).
To meet these objectives required quantifying different mea-
sures of clouds in the trade winds as a function of their
large-scale environment. In the past, efforts to use measure-
