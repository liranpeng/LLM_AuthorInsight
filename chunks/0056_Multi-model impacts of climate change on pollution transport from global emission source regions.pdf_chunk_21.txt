change on pollutant transport from its effects on chemi-
cal processes (e.g. through enhanced chemical reaction rates
or changes in natural climate-sensitive emissions). Idealised
tracers from surface sources used by Holzer and Boer (2001)
showed increases in interhemispheric exchange times, mix-
ing times, and mean transit times between 2000 and 2100.
This study also found a 25 % lower tropospheric average
tracer mixing ratio as well as a reduced cross-tropopause
