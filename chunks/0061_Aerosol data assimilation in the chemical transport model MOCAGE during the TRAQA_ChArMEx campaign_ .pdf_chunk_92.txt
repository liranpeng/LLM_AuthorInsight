data with similar amplitudes as in the assimilation model run.
The statistics of all AERONET stations conﬁrm the overall
positive effect of assimilating MODIS data (Table 3).
The AERONET ﬁndings conﬁrm those obtained by the
comparison with SEVIRI observations. The scatter plot of
all AERONET observations (Fig. 7) reinforces the conclu-
sion that the assimilation model run reduces the bias in the
AOD ﬁeld of the direct model run and signiﬁcantly improves
the statistical parameters.
