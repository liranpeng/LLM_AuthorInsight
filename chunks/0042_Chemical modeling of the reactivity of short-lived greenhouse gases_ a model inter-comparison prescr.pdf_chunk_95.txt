NCAR models in Fig. 3 have larger scatter for reactivities
than the other non-GISS models, but similar scatter in J-
values. This effect may also contribute to the larger day-to-
day rms, for NCAR at least, and is examined more exten-
sively with the UCI CTM running with the T and q’s from
both models (Sect. 3.5).
How overwriting of the data stream’s T and q (with a
CCM climate) impacts these results is tested with the UCI
CTM re-running a one day (16 August 2016) data stream us-
