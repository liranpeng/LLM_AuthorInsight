where the CDF ˆF is estimated empirically using n = 32 iid
samples ˆyi ∼ˆF. Equation (5) corresponds to the CRPS esti-
mate for a singular datapoint. For a given test dataset D, the
corresponding CRPS is obtained as an average of individual
CRPS estimates (5) over all datapoints within D. The first
term in (5) is the MAE between the target and samples of the
10/27
predictive distribution, while the second term is smaller for
