posphere. Poleward transport prevails north of the subtropical jet. However, as the season progresses from
winter to summer, the downward transport weakens, and the equatorward transport expands poleward
(Figure 1b). By July (Figure 1c), the transport in the LMS is dominantly horizontal and equatorward.
Abalos et al. [2013] analyzed the stratospheric O3 budget and found: transport due to the advective residual
