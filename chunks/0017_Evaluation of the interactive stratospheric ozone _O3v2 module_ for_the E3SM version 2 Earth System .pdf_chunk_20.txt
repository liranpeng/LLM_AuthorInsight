ing the EAM tropospheric values every model time step with
the monthly climatologies misses the ozone variability as-
sociated with the regular ridgeâ€“trough tropopause changes,
obscuring the sharp cross-tropopause gradient in ozone and
ozone heating rates. More importantly, O3v1 assigns strato-
spheric high-O3 concentrations to tropospheric air when the
EAM tropopause rises above the monthly climatology in the
prescribed data set. This systematic overestimation of ozone
