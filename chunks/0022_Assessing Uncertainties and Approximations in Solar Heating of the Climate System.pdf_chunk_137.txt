larger fraction of isotropic-equivalent scattering, similar to what happens with increased roughness in the 
Bi-Yang crystals. All of these phase functions have similar asymptotic behavior. The Solar-J treatment of ice 
clouds certainly needs to be updated (e.g., Bi & Yang, 2017; Heymsfield et al., 2013), but is solidly linked to 
the optical properties of ice clouds, and is adequate for the comparisons here.
