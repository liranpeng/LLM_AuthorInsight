member of the historical simulations. This differs from the
usual deﬁnition of ERF where the SSTs are speciﬁed to be a
ﬁxed repeating climatology throughout the simulation, usu-
ally taken from a pre-industrial control experiment. Includ-
ing evolving SSTs means that the underlying climate state is
consistent with the historical simulation that is used as the
reference for all these experiments. Use of historical SSTs
rather than pre-industrial SSTs will eliminate any effects of
