are used (Hoor et al., 2009) and for biomass burning emissions estimates for the year
2000 are taken from the GFEDv1 inventory (Van der Werf et al., 2006) using multi-
year averaged activity data from Andreae and Merlet (2001). The meteorological
ﬁelds are ﬁxed at the year 2003 throughout. Lightning NOx emissions are con-
strained at w5 Tg N yr1. The chemical species for which RTE contribute are NOx, CO,
SO2 and Non-methane Hydrocarbons.
