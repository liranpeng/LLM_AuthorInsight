preliminary analyses, these measurements are proving useful
in quantifying the diel cycle in both the upper ocean and in
the lower atmosphere.
Effects of ocean sub-mesoscale processes on air–sea inter-
actions were the focus of measurements in Region B (Fig. 1).
On two occasions the R/V Ron Brown deployed six SWIFT
drifters (spar buoys) in regions of surface heterogeneity: once
in January near the NTAS buoy and again in early Febru-
ary near 55◦W. The deployments were performed and coor-
