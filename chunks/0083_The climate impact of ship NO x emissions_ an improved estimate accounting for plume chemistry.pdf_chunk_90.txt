sions of 1 Tg(N) yr−1. The RF from the CH4 decrease is
−5.7 ± 1.3 mW m−2, and RF from the long-lived O3 reduc-
tion accompanying the CH4 decrease is −1.7±0.7 mW m−2.
For each component the central estimate is similar to the
smallest magnitude of previously published RF estimates,
due to our treatment of sub-grid-scale chemistry in ship emis-
sion plumes. Combining all these components and account-
ing for correlations caused by common factors, our best esti-
