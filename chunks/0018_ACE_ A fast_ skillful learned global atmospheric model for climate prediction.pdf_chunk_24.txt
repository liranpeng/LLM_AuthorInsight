and bias in units of mm/day (Equations 6 and 7).
Figure 3: Snapshot of the terms in the column moisture budget (Equation 1) one year into simulation
for (top) reference data and (bottom) ACE simulation. Given chaotic nature of atmosphere, we do not
expect details to match between the reference and ACE simulations. If column-integrated moisture is
exactly conserved, the rightmost column should equal zero, as it is for the reference data.
