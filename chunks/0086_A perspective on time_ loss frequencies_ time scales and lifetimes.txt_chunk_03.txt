to avoid mistaken approximations while providing useful parameters describing the system. Abstract Diagnostic quantities involving time include loss frequency, decay times or time scales and lifetimes. For the Earthâ€™s system or any of its components, all of these are calculated differently and have unique diagnostic properties. Local loss frequency is often assumed to be a simple, linear relationship between a species and its loss rate, but this fails in many important cases of atmospheric
