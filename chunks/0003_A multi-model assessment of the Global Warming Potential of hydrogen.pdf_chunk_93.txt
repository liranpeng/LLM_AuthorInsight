changes in methane between PERT_H2 and CTRL, if the methane had not been
ﬁxed at the surface. rCH4 is the radiative efﬁciency of methane including rapid
adjustments, ffCH4 is the methane feedback factor, and CCH4 is the scaled
concentration change of methane.
As mentioned above, the longest-lived, climate-relevant perturbations induced
by molecular hydrogen emissions, will be those tied to the methane perturbation
with an e-fold time of about 12 yr. Thus, for AGWP100, we can assume that all
