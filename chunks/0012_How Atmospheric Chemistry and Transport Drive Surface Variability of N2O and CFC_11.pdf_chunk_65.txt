2000), but these are discredited as noted above.
What changes in the chemistry could drive interannual or decadal shifts 
in lifetime? N2O loss is driven primarily by the overhead O3 column that 
controls photolysis rates (90% of loss), and secondarily by local O3 that 
is the source of O(1D) oxidation (10% of loss). For the MLS period, there 
is a positive trend in upper stratospheric O3 of 1%–2% per decade above 
30 km (see WMO, 2018, Chapter 3, Figures 3–8; Braesicke et al., 2018).
