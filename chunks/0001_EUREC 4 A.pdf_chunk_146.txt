ticular localized upwelling, downwelling, straining, stratiﬁ-
cation variability, wave breaking, and vertical mixing, may
couple with and inﬂuence atmospheric processes, including
cloud formation (Lambaerts et al., 2013; Renault et al., 2016;
Foussard et al., 2019).
To
address
these
questions,
measurements
during
EUREC4A attempted to quantify how near-surface currents,
density, and waves varied across and within different
dynamical regimes, e.g., for mesoscale eddies, fronts, and
