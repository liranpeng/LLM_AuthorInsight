ment, ATom-1), and these included all species relevant for
tropospheric chemistry and the 24 h reactivities. We limited
our study to three reactivities (Rs) controlling methane (CH4)
and tropospheric ozone (O3) using speciﬁc reaction rates to
deﬁne the loss of CH4 and the production and loss of O3 in
