of the day-to-day rms of the models involved. Using the UCI
test with different model years, we Ô¨Ånd that the year-to-year
rms differences are about two thirds of the day-to-day rms
over 5-days. Thus, we cannot be sure that the rms differences
between NCAR and the reference case are due to the inade-
quacy of the 5-day mean to represent the mean NCAR chem-
istry model (Table 3b, c). Conversely, some other source of
model error is likely responsible for the large day-to-day rms.
