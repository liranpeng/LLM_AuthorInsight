modelers need to run their model to achieve a certain so-
lution quality. The solution quality is quantiﬁed in terms of
the ℓ2 error norm for solutions using the same non-divergent
ﬂow ﬁeld as above but with less smooth (C1) initial condi-
tions. A less smooth initial condition is chosen to challenge
the schemes with a more realistic (in terms of smoothness)
initial condition compared to the inﬁnitely smooth Gaussian
hills. This is similar to the setup used in Williamson et al.
