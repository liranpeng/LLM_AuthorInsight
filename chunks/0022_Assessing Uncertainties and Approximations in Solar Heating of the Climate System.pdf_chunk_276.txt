SJ/CLIRAD Solar-J with IR bands replaced with CLIRAD model: 0.70-1.22, 1.22-2.27, and 2.27-
10.0 µm, each with 10 absorption sub-bins for each band (Chou and Suarez, 1996).  The 
edge of the IR transition is shifted from 778 to 700 nm and cross section in bin 18 are 
adjusted.  Only water vapor is included in the IR bands. 
SJ/LLNL 
The IR bands are replaced by the 3 large LLNL bands: 0.69–0.86, 0.86–2.27, and 2.27–
