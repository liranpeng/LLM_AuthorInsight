(ii) quantify different factors inﬂuencing the mass, energy,
and momentum balances in the sub-cloud layer; (iii) identify
processes inﬂuencing the evolution of ocean meso-scale ed-
dies; (iv) measure the inﬂuence of ocean heterogeneity, i.e.,
fronts and eddies, on air–sea interaction and cloud formation;
and (v) provide benchmark measurements for a new genera-
