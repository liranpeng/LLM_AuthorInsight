respect to the distribution of the high-fidelity training data cor-
responding to the SPCAM5 historical run. On the other hand,
the low-fidelity training data was built such that it provides
the MF model with useful information regarding the extrapo-
lation scenarios. If the MF-RPN model is built based on data
normalization using the low-fidelity training data, then its pre-
dictions for high-fidelity testing data points will be estimated
