fracture.
Future directions
Our ageing population, whilst driving rising hip fracture inci-
dence, also increases the burden of fragility fractures of the 
hip. Understanding the impact of delays on these conditions is 
crucial to guide how best to allocate resources. Our single cen-
tre study benefits from consistent data collection and similar 
peri-operative care across the cohort, but expanding this to a 
multi-centre study would enhance understanding of this topic.
