method (Parrish and Derber, 1992). Satellite AOD errors are
deﬁned for retrievals over water using a multi-regression for-
mula, and for retrievals over land using the percentage ap-
proach with deﬁning a minimal possible error. Their 4-D-Var
analysis results qualitatively showed a very similar impact of
assimilation as in this study.
We assimilated the data of MODIS, which has two over-
passes per day during daytime. Satellite data with higher tem-
