For models without interactive chemistry, hist-piNTCF and
hist-piAer are identical and the same ozone climatology as
historical should be used. Note that the climate signal from
aerosols and reactive gas perturbations will include biogeo-
chemical feedbacks via climate impacts on emissions, chem-
istry and transport of constituents, which requires further ex-
periments and diagnostics described below in Sect. 3.4.
The total simulation years requested for this set of experi-
