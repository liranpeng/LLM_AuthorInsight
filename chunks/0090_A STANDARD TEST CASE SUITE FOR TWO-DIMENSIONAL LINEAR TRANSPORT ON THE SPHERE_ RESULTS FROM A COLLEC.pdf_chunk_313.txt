control volume situated upwind to the edge. We present re-
sults obtained with a CN equal to 0.8, but the scheme seems
to work up to maximum CFL equal to 1.0.

TTS-I
The TTS-I scheme operates on a fully Lagrangian mesh. The
initial grid is a centroidal Voronoi tessellation of the sphere,
and its resolution is given in terms of number of polygons.
