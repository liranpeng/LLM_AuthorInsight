In our system, the lack of secondary aerosols is presumed
to have an inﬂuence on assimilation performance. This could
lead to an underestimation of the direct model AOD in the
regions where the secondary aerosols have an important in-
ﬂuence. During the TRAQA period, the primary aerosols had
a dominant effect on the aerosol ﬁeld, mainly because of the
two desert dust events that occurred during the campaign,
and this was favourable for the evaluation of our system. In
