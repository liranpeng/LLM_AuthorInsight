emissions, and +2 % yr−1; emissions stop increasing in the
+2 % yr−1 case when they reach 25 Gt yr−1 (Fig. 9a). Sce-
narios with decreasing emissions are preceded by constant
emissions for 2015–2020, in recognition that some time is
required to achieve policy change and implementation. Note
the similarity of RCP2.6 with −3 % yr−1, RCP4.5 with con-
stant emissions, and RCP8.5 with +2 % yr−1 (Fig. 9).
