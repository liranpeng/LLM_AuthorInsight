tropical regions, and the simple chemical statistics for these
ﬂights alone are probably enough to identify measurement-
model discrepancies. For the HOx-related species, the mod-
els match the ﬁrst-order statistics from ATom. In terms of
using ATom statistics as a model metric, it is encouraging
that where individual models tend to deviate from their peers,
they also deviate from the ATom-1 PDs.
