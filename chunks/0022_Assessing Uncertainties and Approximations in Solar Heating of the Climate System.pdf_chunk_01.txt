The heat from sunlight drives the weather and climate system, the energy in solar photons drives atmospheric 
chemistry, and the photosynthetically active radiation drives life. For Earth system models (ESMs), one needs 
to calculate the scattering, absorption, and reflection of solar radiation throughout the atmosphere, ocean, 
cryosphere, and land surface. The idealized radiative transfer (RT) problem is well known and in many cases
