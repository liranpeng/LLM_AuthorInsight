Solar-J in a climate model.
Solar-J is a starting point. In assessing the Ô¨Ådelity of Solar-
J in terms of interaction with the many components of the
climate system, we can focus on the three major sources of
costs/error (spectral intervals, multi-stream radiative transfer,
and complex cloud systems) and, in parallel, on the opportu-
nities for accelerated performance with new computational
architectures. Ideally, the community would optimize com-
