tude than many past estimates. The parametric model may
underestimate the trend because it does not consider the lo-
cation of anthropogenic emissions. We also use the paramet-
ric model to project future methane abundance, which im-
plicitly assumes that the emission and climate processes that
controlled methane lifetime in the recent past will remain
dominant throughout the 21st century. For the RCP 8.5 sce-
nario, our projected methane abundances are larger than the
