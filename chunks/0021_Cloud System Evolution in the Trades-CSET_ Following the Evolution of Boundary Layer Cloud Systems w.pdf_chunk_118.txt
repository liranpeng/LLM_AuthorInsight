associated with layers of very low aerosol concentrations (UHSAS concentrations <10 # cm
âˆ’3) near the top of the boundary layer. An example of these veil cloud layers and ultra clean 
layer is shown in Fig. 12 with the HSRL observations made on RF07. A full study of the veil 
clouds and the clean layers observed during CSET is given in Wood et al. (2018). They 
estimate that cloud cover associated with the veil clouds to be about 50% within the
