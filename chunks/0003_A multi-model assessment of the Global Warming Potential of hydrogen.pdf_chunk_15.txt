the models with 10% increase in hydrogen and methane surface
concentrations, respectively, and combine the results to derive the
full chemical response of perturbing hydrogen emissions. This
approach allows us to assess separate uncertainties in the terms
used to derive the GWP, and thus give us a better estimate of the
overall uncertainty. Two models (OsloCTM and GFDL) also
contribute
