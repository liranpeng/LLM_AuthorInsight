problem was not caused by emission inventory errors, but
instead arose from the expedient but inaccurate modeling as-
sumption that ship exhaust instantly mixes into a model grid
cell, which is typically hundreds of kilometers wide. Under
this instant dilution assumption coarse-resolution models by-
pass the early stages of plume dilution when high NOx con-
centrations intensify NOx chemical losses and suppress O3
formation severalfold (Chen et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2009;
