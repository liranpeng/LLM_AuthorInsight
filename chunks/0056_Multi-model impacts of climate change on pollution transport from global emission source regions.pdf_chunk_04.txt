time-slice simulations for present-day and end-of-the-21st-
century conditions were performed under the Representative
Concentrations Pathway (RCP) climate scenario RCP 8.5.
All simulations reveal a strong seasonality in transport, espe-
cially over the tropics. The highest CO-tracer mixing ratios
aloft occur during boreal winter when strong vertical trans-
port is co-located with biomass burning emission source re-
gions. A consistent and robust decrease in future CO-tracer
