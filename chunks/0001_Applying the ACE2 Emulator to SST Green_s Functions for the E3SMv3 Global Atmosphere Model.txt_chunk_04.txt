Pacific. These discrepancies may reflect insufficient diversity in the SST patterns sampled over the course of the EAMv3 AMIP simulation used for training ACE. Both ACE and EAMv3 Green's functions reconstruct the historical record of the global annual-mean TOA radiative flux from a reference EAMv3 AMIP simulation reasonably well. Notably, under our configuration and compute resources, ACE achieves these results approximately 100 times faster in wall-clock time compared to EAMv3, highlighting
