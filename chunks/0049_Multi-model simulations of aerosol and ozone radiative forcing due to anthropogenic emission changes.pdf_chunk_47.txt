ous estimates. The ECLIPSE SO2 emission change over the
1990–2015 period is about −20 %, including international
shipping (Klimont et al., 2016; Stohl et al., 2015). Despite
the overall positive direct aerosol forcing of sulfate over the
1990–2015 period from a global reduction of sulfate, it is
negative in the intermediate 5-year period 2000–2005.
The model mean global mean radiative forcing of BC di-
rect aerosol effect increases over the 1990–2010 period by
