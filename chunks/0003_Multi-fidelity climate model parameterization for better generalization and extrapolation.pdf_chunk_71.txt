CRM columns and 25 CRM vertical levels.
For SPCAM5 training and testing datasets considered, the
first 4 vertical levels starting form Top Of the Atmosphere
(TOA) show all zero values for the moisture tendency across
all earth and for the whole simulations time periods. There-
fore, the first 4 vertical levels starting form TOA have been
discarded for the moisture tendency in the parameterization
problem, and coherently for the specific humidity.
