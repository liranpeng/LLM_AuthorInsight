chemical statistics, Yu et al. (2016) used 60 s data (∼12 km)
from the SEAC4RS aircraft mission to compare cumulative
probability densities (PDs) of NOx, O3, HCHO, and iso-
prene over the Southeast US with the GEOS-Chem CTM
run at different resolutions. They identiﬁed clear biases at
the high and low ends of the distribution, providing a new
test of models based on the statistics rather than mean val-
ues. Heald et al. (2011) gathered high-resolution proﬁling of
