cal stratosphere.
The radiative transfer code in E3SM takes into account the
ozone changes (Rasch et al., 2019) and thus responds with
different heating proﬁles. The total net heating (shortwave +
longwave) results from the E3SM simulations are shown in
Fig. 8 for the UT–LS region. The O3v2 causes slight (up to
a few percent) net cooling around the tropopause at all lati-
tudes (except at SH high latitudes in austral spring-summer
time) and net warming in the lowermost stratosphere in the
