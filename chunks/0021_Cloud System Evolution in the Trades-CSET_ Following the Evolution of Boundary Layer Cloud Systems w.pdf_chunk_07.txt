system were the newly developed HIAPER Cloud Radar (HCR) and the High Spectral Resolution 
Lidar (HSRL). Together they provided unprecedented characterizations of aerosol, cloud and 
precipitation structures that were combined with in situ measurements of aerosol, cloud, 
precipitation, and turbulence properties. The cloud systems sampled included solid stratocumulus 
infused with smoke from Canadian wildfires, mesoscale cloud-precipitation complexes, and
