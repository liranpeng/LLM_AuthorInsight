lated from the pole to the intersect with the e90 surface near the tropics (denoted with the subscript LMS in
Figure 1j), whereas the simulated hemispheric ﬂux (green solid line in Figure 1i) is calculated from the pole
to the equator. The downward ﬂux entering the LMS across the 100 hPa surface correlates weakly with the
TC-e90 ﬂux (r = 0.18). Adding the photochemical term reduces the correlation (to r = 0.10). However, further
