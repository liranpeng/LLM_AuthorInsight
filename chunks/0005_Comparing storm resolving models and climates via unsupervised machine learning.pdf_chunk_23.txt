ingful and can be well-described using only three learned latent clusters that correspond to distinct convective 
organizations.
Cluster characterization
As a first qualitative analysis, we can learn a shared clustering across the dimensionality-reduced data of all 
nine GSRMs (Fig.Â 3). Since the latent space is 1000-dimensional, we plot the dominant two (or three) principal 
components for visualization purposes. Each data point is colorized according to its cluster assignment, i.e., its
