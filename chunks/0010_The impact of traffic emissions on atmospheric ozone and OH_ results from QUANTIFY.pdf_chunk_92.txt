ozone perturbation from road trafﬁc during summer is even
higher than the perturbation due to aircraft emissions in win-
ter, highlighting the role of road trafﬁc for the chemical state
of the UTLS in summer (see also Fig. 7). Ship emissions,
despite of the high importance in the July boundary layer
(Fig. 5) do not show a similar effect in the UTLS, indicat-
ing that convective and large scale transport from the marine
boundary layer do not have the same impact as continental
