can match the observed statistics of J values. This approach
gets to the core of atmospheric photochemistry by combining
the range of assumptions and parameterizations for clouds
in the models including, among others, cloud optical depths
(CODs) and scattering phase functions, two-stream or multi-
stream radiative transfer, cloud overlap, or even just paramet-
ric correction factors.
Section 2 describes the measurements and models, includ-
