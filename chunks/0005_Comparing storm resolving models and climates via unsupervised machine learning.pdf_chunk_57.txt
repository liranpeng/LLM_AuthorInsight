By geographically conditioning the latent space cluster associated with “Green Cumuli” we can not only 
confirm the regional patterns of the mode, but we can begin to uncover unique physical properties behind its 
formation and growth. Looking at the condition of the atmosphere in these geographic regions during the times 
when “Green Cumuli” dominate, we identify consistent signatures of very high sensible heat flux, relatively low
