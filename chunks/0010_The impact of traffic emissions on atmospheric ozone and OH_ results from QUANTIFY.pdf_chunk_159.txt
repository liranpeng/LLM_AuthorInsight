efﬁciency of air trafﬁc on ozone perturbations arises from the
relatively long lifetime of NOx and its reservoir species PAN
and HNO3 at the altitudes where the emissions occur.
Based on the fully scaled perturbations our results indicate
the strongest mean positive sensitivities of road emissions on
radiative forcing (7.3±6.2 mWm−2) due to a strong response
of ozone in the upper troposphere. Aircraft induced forc-
ings on ozone and methane are somewhat lower (16.3 and
