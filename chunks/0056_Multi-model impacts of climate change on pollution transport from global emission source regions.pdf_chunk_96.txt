is rather variable. Other wind component Ô¨Åelds were not
archived in the ACCMIP simulations, which prohibits fur-
ther investigation into the relationship between mid-latitude
jet stream changes and CO-tracer responses over the mid-
latitudes.

Tropopause height
Robust increases in CO-tracer mixing ratios near the
tropopause in the tropical and northern mid-latitudes in re-
sponse to climate change are seen in all four CCMs (Figs. 2
and 3). The annual average multi-model mean tropopause in
