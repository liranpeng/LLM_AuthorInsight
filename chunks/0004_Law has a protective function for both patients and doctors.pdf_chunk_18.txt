We prefer short letters that relate to articles
published within the past four weeks. Letters
received after this deadline stand less chance
of acceptance. We also publish some "out of
the blue"
letters, which usually relate to
matters of public policy.
When deciding which letters to publish we
favour originality, assertions supported by
data or by citation, and a clear prose style.
Wit, passion, and personal experience also
have their place.
Letters should have fewer than 400 words
