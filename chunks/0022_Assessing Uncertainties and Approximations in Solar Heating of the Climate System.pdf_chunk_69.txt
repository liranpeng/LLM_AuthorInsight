Figure 3.  (a and b) Single scattering albedo (SSA, dimensionless) for water clouds versus wavelength (µm), including 
both (a) ice and (b) liquid water (bottom). The RRTMG infrared (IR) bins, designated #18 through #27 are demarcated 
by dashed vertical lines with average SSA denoted (large circle with cross bar and light-colored fill). The solar energy
