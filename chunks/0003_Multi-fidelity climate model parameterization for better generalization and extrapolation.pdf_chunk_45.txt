as a stochasticity-aware surrogate model.
For the moisture tendency, the overall performance of all
models for almost all vertical levels is lower in terms of R2
compared to the results obtained for the heat tendency (fig-
ure 2). This result can be mainly attributed to the higher
stochasticity of humidity and precipitation compared to the
temperature. The MF-RPN model is the best performing
model for all pressure levels except for the 188hPa vertical
