ground; Jo is a part of the cost function related to the obser-
vations; δx = x −xb is the misﬁt between the background xb
and the state of the system x; di = yi −Hixb(ti) is the inno-
vation and represents the distance of the observation yi from
the background xb at time ti; Hi is the non-linear observation
operator; H is its linearized version (the tangent-linear); B is
the background error covariance matrix; and Ri is the obser-
vation error covariance matrix at time ti. The matrices B and
