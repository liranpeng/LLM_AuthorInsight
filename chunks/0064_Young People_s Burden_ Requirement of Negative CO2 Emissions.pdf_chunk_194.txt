tion, also called geoengineering, and speciÔ¨Åcally solar radi-
ation management (SRM). The cooling mechanism receiv-
ing greatest attention is injection of SO2 into the stratosphere
(Budyko, 1974; Crutzen, 2006), thus creating sulfuric acid
aerosols that mimic the effect of volcanic aerosol cooling.
That idea and others are discussed in a report of the US Na-
tional Academy of Sciences (NAS, 2015b) and references
therein. We limit our discussion to the following summary
comments.
