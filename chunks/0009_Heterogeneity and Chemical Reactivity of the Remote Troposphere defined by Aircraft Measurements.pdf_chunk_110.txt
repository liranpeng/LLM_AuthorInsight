this time. In the Atlantic, the models’ NOx shows too fre-
quent occurrence of low NOx (< 10 ppt) and thus underes-
timates the 10–100 ppt levels at all altitudes. ATom has a
strong peak occurrence about 80–120 ppt in the upper tro-
posphere, and, like the eastern Paciﬁc, this is probably due
to lightning NOx from deep convection over land (Africa or
South America). Overall, the models appear to be missing
signiﬁcant NOx sources throughout the tropics, especially
below 4 km.
