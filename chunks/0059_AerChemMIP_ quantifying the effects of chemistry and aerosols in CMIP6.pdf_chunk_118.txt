SST and sea ice distributions. The “AER” sufﬁx means that models should at least calculate tropospheric aerosols driven by emission ﬂuxes.
The “CHEMT” or “CHEMS” sufﬁx means that at least tropospheric or stratospheric chemistry is required. Models should always be run
with the maximum complexity available. The species columns refer to the speciﬁcations for concentrations (CH4, N2O and CFC/HCFC) or
