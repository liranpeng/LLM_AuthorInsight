For the four seasonal deployments of ATom-1234 (August,
February, October, and May, respectively), we use the pro-
ﬁling curtains to identify large-scale regions of the tropo-
sphere that drive the budgets, particularly in the lower tro-
posphere for loss of O3 and CH4 as well as the smaller het-
erogeneities, particularly in the upper troposphere for NOx-
driven hotspots of O3 production. These results are the ﬁrst
near-global views of the remote troposphere, primarily the
