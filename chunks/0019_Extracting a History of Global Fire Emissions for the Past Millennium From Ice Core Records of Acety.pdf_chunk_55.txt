Therefore, using the average mixing ratios in these regions is representative of the average mixing ratios
over Greenland and Antarctica. Sensitivities were computed for emissions from biomass burning (from
several different regions), biofuels, fossil fuels, and geologic emissions (Table 1).
3.2. Modeling: Methane and 13CH4 Box Model
A one‚Äêbox steady state atmospheric box model based on Nicewonger et al. (2018) was used to calculate
