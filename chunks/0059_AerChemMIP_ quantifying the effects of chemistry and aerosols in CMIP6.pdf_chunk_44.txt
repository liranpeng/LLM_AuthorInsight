doubled since pre-industrial times (from 722 ± 25 ppb in
1750 to 1803 ± 2 ppb by 2011), it is imperative to quantify
its historical forcing and the combined climate impacts as-
sociated with those changes. Furthermore, the ERF due to
ozone and aerosol changes since pre-industrial times is a key
factor behind the large uncertainty in constraining climate
sensitivity using observations of the historical record.
The ERF due to NTCFs has an inhomogeneous spatial dis-
