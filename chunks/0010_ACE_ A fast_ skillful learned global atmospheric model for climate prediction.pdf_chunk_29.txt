nearly obeys the column-wise conservation of moisture (Eq. 1). Figure 3 shows the magnitude of
the violation of the budget is very small compared to the individual terms in the budget: standard
deviation of total water path tendency is âˆ¼50 times that of the column budget violation term. This is
true even one year into the inference simulation. Global mean budgets are described in Appendix G.
Zero-shot generalization to realistic sea surface temperature forcing
