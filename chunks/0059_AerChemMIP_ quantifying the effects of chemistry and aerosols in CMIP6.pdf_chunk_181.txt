semble members as Tier 2. A total of three members (using
the AerChemMIP model conﬁguration) are required as the
baseline for the AerChemMIP future experiments. We rec-
ommend that the AER CHEM conﬁguration with AerChem-
MIP diagnostics be used for as many as possible of the other
ScenarioMIP experiments in order to understand the range
of possible future evolution of aerosols, reactive gases and
surface air quality concentrations.
