Methane-induced changes were included by scaling results from the
methane experiment to the expected methane change in the
hydrogen experiment (see Supplementary Fig. 2).
In the troposphere, all models show a decrease in OH resulting
in increased levels and longer lifetime of methane. The reduction
in OH also causes an increase in HO2, leading to increased
