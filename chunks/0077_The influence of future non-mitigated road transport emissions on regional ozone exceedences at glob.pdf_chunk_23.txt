2050, the NTS is either equal to or lower than that in 2025 due to
mitigation and the implementation of technological developments.
For RTE NOx emissions become either comparable to (e.g. South
America) or lower than (e.g. Asia) those from the shipping sector.
Analysing the regional NOx emission trends shown in Fig. 1 re-
veals that the Asian region has the largest RTE of NOx across the
entire timeline, with the annually integrated RTE being approxi-
