1 −F G1(1 −gG1F G2)/(1 −F G2).

All of these formulae also work if F G1 > F G2 and if F G1 = 0
or 1 (same for F G2). A special case of MAX-COR is MAX-
RAN when cc = 0. With the cloud fractions binned into 10
intervals, then the number of ICAs for MAX-COR or MAX-
RAN models scales as 10NG, where NG is the number of
MAX groups.
