H. Guo et al.: Heterogeneity and chemical reactivity of the remote troposphere
sults have been examined by a co-author, but no clear causes
have been identiﬁed as of this publication. The problem goes
beyond just the implementation of the RDS protocol, as it
shows up in the model climatology (Figs. 4 and 5, also in
P2017).
Decadal-scale shifts in the budgets of O3 and CH4 are
likely to be evident through the statistical patterns of the key
