questions that could not be addressed with data from ear-
lier ﬁeld studies. For instance, what resolution is required for
atmospheric models with an explicit (ﬂuid-dynamical) rep-
resentation of clouds and convection to represent the ver-
tical structure of the lower troposphere, and its interaction
with mesoscale vertical motion and upper-ocean variability,
within the observational uncertainty? The ﬁne scale of the
EUREC4A measurements also makes it possible to quan-
