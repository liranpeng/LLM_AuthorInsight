vection test case to demonstrate that shape-preserving lim-
iters effectively eliminate spurious grid-scale oscillations.
Contrary to traditional speciﬁcations of the slotted-cylinder
initial condition, we have chosen to overlay it by a back-
ground value of φ = 0.1 instead of a zero background value.
Again, this is motivated by typical conditions found in the at-
mosphere where structures in tracer distributions frequently
overlay some smooth background distribution. In that case,
