impact of ROAD on the atmospheric chemical composition
has, unlike the AIR and SHIP sectors, been investigated in
relatively few studies (Granier and Brasseur, 2003; Niemeier
et al., 2006; Matthes et al., 2007).
Six different atmospheric chemistry models have been
used to simulate changes in O3 and OH from the three trans-
port sectors. Section 3 presents these results along with the
RF calculations. In addition, we present in Sect. 4 a synthe-
