AOT, including AOT in cloudy fractions with high humidi-
ties, while others restrict output to clear-sky AOT. The latter
is preferred here, because it may be compared to that AOT
which is observed under clear-sky conditions from satellites
and sun photometers. Aerosol–radiation interactions are also
most effective in clear-sky scenes, and it is thus more relevant
to base forcing efﬁciencies on clear-sky AOT. If models com-
pute normally an all-sky AOT using high relative humidities
