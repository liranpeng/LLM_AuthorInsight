Shifts in the tropopause height can solely arise from sys-
tematic biases in the dynamics (e.g. temperature cold bias).
Generally, an inter-comparison relative to the tropopause
height reveals a better representation of tropospheric and
stratospheric simulated ozone (Grewe et al., 2001b).
In
order to avoid misleading interpretations, we concentrate
here on regions with a more uniform dynamical characteri-
zation. Tropical tropospheric ozone (0â€“12 km, 20N-20S) is
