that exact vertical integrals of quantities such as mass, moisture and energy can be computed and
expected to balance with fluxes into and out of the atmosphere.

Table 2: ACE vertical coordinate. Here k indicates the vertical layer interface ranging from the top of
the modelâ€™s atmosphere k = 0 to the Earth surface k = 8. ak and bk define the vertical coordinate
(Equation 2) while Ik indicates what the corresponding vertical index is in the 63-layer reference
FV3GFS simulation. pref
