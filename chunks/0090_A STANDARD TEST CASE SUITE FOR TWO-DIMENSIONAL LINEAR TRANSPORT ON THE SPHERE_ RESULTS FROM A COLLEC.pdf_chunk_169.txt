domain in which the mixing ratio is larger than the thresh-
old value τ. If the ℓf(τ) curve is smooth and monotonically
decreasing as a function of τ, the schemes diffusive char-
acteristics are smooth and continuous. Schemes that tend to
steepen gradients will spuriously force ℓf(τ) > 100 for rel-
atively large τ values. Schemes that make use of “ad hoc”
ﬁxers (that also alter gradients) may produce an oscillatory
ℓf(τ) curve.
