this well-known feature of the N2O budget derived from previous studies (Nevison et al., 2018; Thompson 
et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020).
We investigate disruptions to the QBO, their impacts on N2O loss, and the models' ability to capture these 
impacts. The models have trouble capturing the surface impact of anomalous QBOs which coincide with 
strong, but opposite ENSO events (La Niña (2010/11) versus El Niño (2015/16)), which further confounds
