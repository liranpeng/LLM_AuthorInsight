ods as for example explained in Durran (2010). The spectral
transforms used in the SBC scheme are also based on se-
ries expansions (global). However, since the expansions are
only used to provide gradients for the Lagrange interpolant,
the SBC scheme is not categorized as a series-expansion
scheme. In this intercomparison one scheme (with several
variants) under this category participated and is referred
to as HOMME (High-Order Methods Modeling Environ-
