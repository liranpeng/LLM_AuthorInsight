to affect the any of the results here, even with high levels
of lightning-NO in daytime. The initiation time might affect
highly polluted regions where the NOx reservoirs could be
converted at night to less photolabile nitrates.
Two additional sensitivity tests included running the ﬁve
days in August with a ﬁxed solar declination (Fig. S9) and
with different restart ﬁle (Fig. S10). As shown in these ﬁg-
