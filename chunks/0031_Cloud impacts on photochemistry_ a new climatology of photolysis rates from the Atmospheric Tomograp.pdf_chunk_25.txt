relationships are applied to the measured and modeled spec-
tra. The strong connection between measurement and model
has been established in past campaigns (Shetter et al., 2002,
2003; Hofzumahaus et al., 2004). The ATom CAFS data
set used here is a value-added product beyond the standard
ATom output (Wofsy et al., 2018), and it is archived with this
paper. Only data from the Ô¨Årst deployment, ATom-1, were
available when this paper was being prepared.
