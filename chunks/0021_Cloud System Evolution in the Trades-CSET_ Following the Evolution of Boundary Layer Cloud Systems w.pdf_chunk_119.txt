transition areas sampled during CSET. These clouds are both physically and optically thin. 
In addition, to the extensive lidar and radar observations during CSET, the GV made several 
direct penetrations of the veill clouds during CSET that allowed for a characterization of the 
properties of the clouds and the aerosols in the vicinity of the clouds.
The clean layers near cloud top are clearly shown on several of the flights (Wood et al,
