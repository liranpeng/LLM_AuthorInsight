the mean radiation Ô¨Åeld in the presence of thick water clouds
and found that eight streams were necessary to have errors
of only a few percent relative to a 160-stream code that re-
solved the scattering phase function. For Solar-J, we adopt
the Wild et al. (2000) optimization for water clouds and use
Mie (liquid) or Mishchenko (ice) (Mishchenko et al., 1996,
2004) full phase functions for scattering, truncate the expan-
sion in Legendre polynomials to order 8, and solve the scat-
