transport of N2O-depleted air to the surface. This work identifies a distinct QBO signal originating from the 
stratosphere that appears in both observed and modeled surface N2O. These results are a 20-year follow-on 
to the Hamilton and FanÂ (2000) original work that showed a QBO-forced signal in surface N2O but lacked 
the satellite data, surface observations, and modern CTM capabilities to confirm it. If we use the QBO signal
