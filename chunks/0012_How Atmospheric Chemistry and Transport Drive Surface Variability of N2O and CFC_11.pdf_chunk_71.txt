sphere into the middle stratosphere where it is destroyed, it is not particularly sensitive to the rate of tropical 
upwelling below 24 km because little N2O is lost there. Thus, the covariance of F11X and N2OX losses iden-
tifies some coherence in tropical upwelling in the stratosphere from 20 to 40 km altitude. In addition, F11X
