and b (surface–900 hPa) using the same format as Fig. 5.
Each of the 18 panels in Fig. 7a, b represents a single model
and a single pressure level for which there are seven bars
(sampled distributions of rlnJ). The top four bars show the
full tropical Paciﬁc (as in Fig. 5b) and then the three sub-
sampled regions. The next three bars are the previously sam-
pled statistics (North Paciﬁc, global 50◦S–50◦N, and tropi-
cal Paciﬁc CAFS). The CAFS bars are the same in each nine-
