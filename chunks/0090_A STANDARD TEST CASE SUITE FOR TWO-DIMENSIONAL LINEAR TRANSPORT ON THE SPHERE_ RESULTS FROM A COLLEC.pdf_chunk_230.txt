3.6
Divergent ﬂow experiment
Here we repeat the experiment described in Sect. 3.2 but re-
place the non-divergent wind ﬁeld (used in all prior tests)
with the divergent wind ﬁeld deﬁned in LSPT2012. All other
settings are the same: time step, cosine bell initial condi-
tions, etc. The purpose of this test case is to have model-
ers demonstrate that their scheme is well-behaved also for
divergent ﬂow ﬁelds. For some classes of schemes, such as
