with +4 % and −1 % ripples, no decay of the plateau val-
ues, and no increase in ℓ2 error over successive rotations. For
small overshoot allowance (0.2 %), however, we regain some
of the desired properties (i.e., the ripples are smaller, +2.5 %
and −1 %), but the plateau tracer does not decay. In general
the ℓ2 errors are similar for L = 0,1,2, but increase for L = 3
except for CN< 0.2.
