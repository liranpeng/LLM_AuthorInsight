lar but with some large systematic biases. For SZAs of 0–
62◦, Solar-J reﬂects ∼10 W m−2 (2–3 %) more sunlight back
to space, both models calculate about the same increase in
atmospheric absorption, and RRTMG-SW consistently ab-
sorbs less energy within the cloud but more above it; thus,
Solar-J calculates greater reduction in surface heating (also
about 2–3 %) than RRTMG-SW. These differences in so-
lar heating are large compared with anthropogenic climate
