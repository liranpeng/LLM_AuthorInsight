COD). The total COD is given (color coded) in each block.
The proÔ¨Åles show very large variability that is hard to un-
derstand. For example, GFDL and GISS show the largest
COD, yet both are in Group 1 with the largest fraction of
clear sky. Overall the total COD does not obviously corre-
late with the two groups. Likewise, CF is not a predictor for
the group. It is likely that model differences are driven by
the treatment of fractional cloud cover. For example, GMI
