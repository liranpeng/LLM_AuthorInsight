the isotropic scattering used in RRTMG-SW. Solar-J captures
the cirrus albedo curve similar to Fig. 2 of Mishchenko et
al. (1996) for τ = 0.1 in which the slope increases rapidly
as the cosine (SZA) approaches 0. While the RRTMG-SW
two-stream models can be tuned to be correct at some SZAs,
they will have errors of 15 W m−2 at others. The change
in surface heating (ﬁfth row) looks like the reverse of the
top-of-atmosphere bars with similar relative weighting of the
