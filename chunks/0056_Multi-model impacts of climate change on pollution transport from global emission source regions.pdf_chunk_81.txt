altitudes over northern mid-latitudes during summer simu-
lated by the GISS-E2-R CCM (Fig. 2d) may be related to
stronger convective mass ﬂuxes at this altitude (Fig. 7d).
A robust feature across all of the models is an overall re-
duction in convection, as reported by Held and Soden (2006),
in response to climate change in the 2090s throughout most
