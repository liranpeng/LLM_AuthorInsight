RPN is fitted using a joint training strategy of both networks.
Hence the corresponding loss function that is minimized by
stochastic gradient descent contains two terms. One term
ensures that the first network learns the low-fidelity parameter-
ization (red network in figure 1.a). The second term ensures
that the pipeline through both networks learns the high-fidelity
parameterization (red and blue networks in figure 1.b). Let
fÎ¸LF,j denote the red network learning the LF paramterization,
