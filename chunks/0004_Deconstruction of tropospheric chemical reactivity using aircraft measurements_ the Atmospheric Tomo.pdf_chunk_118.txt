models in the Thornhill study each seem aberrant in their
own way.) From Table 4, a +1 K change increases L-CH4
by 2.5 %, and the Clausius–Clapeyron-inferred 7 % increase
in Q adds 3.4 % for a total of 5.9 % K−1, a reasonable ﬁrst-
order result considering that other climate-driven changes,
such as O3, are not included. For model evaluation, compar-
ing T with mean proﬁles is straightforward, but H2O is more
difﬁcult, even with proﬁles, because of the 3 orders of magni-
