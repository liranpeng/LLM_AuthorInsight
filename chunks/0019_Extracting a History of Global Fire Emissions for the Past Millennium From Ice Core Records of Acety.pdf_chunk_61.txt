where m stands for the modeled acetylene level and o for the observed mean level of acetylene from the ice
core record from Greenland (grn) and Antarctica (ant). Emissions scenarios were considered viable if
Δacetylene, grn and Δacetylene, ant were both <0.1 and rejected if either Δacetylene, grn or Δacetylene, ant were
>0.1 as was done in Nicewonger et al. (2018, 2020).
