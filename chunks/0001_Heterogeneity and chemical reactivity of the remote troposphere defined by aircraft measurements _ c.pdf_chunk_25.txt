ﬁnd some average biases of order ±10 % but general agree-
ment. The largest systematic biases in the A runs are caused
by buildup of HOOH (no scavenging) and decay of NOx (no
sources). The A runs are relatively easy to code for most
CTM/CCMs and allow each model’s chemistry module, in-
cluding photolysis package, to run normally. The A runs do
not distinguish between CTMs and CCMs, except that each
model will generate/prescribe its own cloud ﬁelds and pho-
