pairs and the LS-e90 pair, and is nearly zero for the other two LS pairs. In contrast, the residual O3 ï¬‚uxes con-
trolled by the large-scale BDC between these two cycles appear well correlated at the value of 0.9. Hence
transport within the LMS, below 100 hPa, is very sensitive to the forecast model here.
4. Discussion and Conclusion
This work presents a self-consistent calculation of the net O3 STE using a range of currently applied methods.
