magnitude of the emission change.
Absorbing aerosols also impact climate after deposition to
bright surfaces. In particular, BC causes additional warming
of climate after deposition onto snow and ice surfaces by
reducing the albedo of snow.90 Flanner et al.91 estimate that
the snow-albedo forcing and associated feedbacks from all
anthropogenic BC emissions result in global warming (annual
mean temperature) of between 0.1 and 0.15 K, while Jacobson92
