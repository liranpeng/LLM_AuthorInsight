clouds on J values seen in Fig. 3 will have a correspondingly
large impact on global tropospheric chemistry (see Liu et al.,
2009).

The statistical distribution of J-cloudy to J-clear
The average ratio of J-cloudy to J-clear (Fig. 3) provides
only a single measure of the impact of clouds. The CAFS
data provide a more acute measure by sampling the range of
cloud effects (enhance or diminish J values) and their fre-
quency of occurrence. A quick look at this range in CAFS
