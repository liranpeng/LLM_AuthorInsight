dation between 200 hPa and the tropopause is 1.5 % of tropo-
spheric methane loss, or less. We calculate the total methane
lifetime, τCH4, using τCH4×OH values from this work and
recently estimated lifetimes for other methane sinks: tro-
pospheric chlorine (200 yr), stratosphere (120 yr), and soil
(150 yr) (Prather et al., 2012).

Oslo CTM3 is a stratospheric and tropospheric CTM, re-
