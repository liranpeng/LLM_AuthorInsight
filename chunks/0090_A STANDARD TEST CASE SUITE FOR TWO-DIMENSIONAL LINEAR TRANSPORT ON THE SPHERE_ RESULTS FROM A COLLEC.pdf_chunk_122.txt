was designed to assess “optimal” convergence rates given the
smoothness of the initial condition and v.
The numerical convergence rates are computed using a
least-squares linear regression of the form
log(ℓi) = Ai −Ki log(1λ),
i = 2,∞,
(11)
where Ki denotes constants for the resolution range approx-
imately 3◦to 0.3◦(a Gnuplot script was made available as
supplemental material in LSPT2012 to perform the least-
squares regression). Note that the resolution range has de-
