software so as to be affordable. For example, the 8-stream Fast-J code is being implemented in E3SM for 
chemistry-climate modeling. Based on B2015, any of these options would be a significant improvement 
for climate modeling.

reflects both the lack of multi-stream capability to resolve the ice crystal scattering and the fundamen-
