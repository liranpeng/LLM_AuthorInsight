the annual growth rate. The mean annual cycle has a slightly larger amplitude and is discussed in Section 4.
For a clearer picture of the QBO signal at the surface, we create a composite of QBO cycles in surface N2O 
in ppb/yr by averaging at each latitude for each month starting 14 months prior and extending to 14 months 
after the QBO (Figure 3). For this diagnostic, the mean interannual percent change is removed and we
