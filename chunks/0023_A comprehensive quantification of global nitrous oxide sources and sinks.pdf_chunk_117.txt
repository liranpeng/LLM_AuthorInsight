consideration of land use change (for example, deforestation) and 
without consideration of indirect anthropogenic effects via global 
change (that is, climate, increased CO2 and atmospheric nitrogen 
deposition). Bottom-up oceanic N2O emissions were based on an 
inter-comparison of five global ocean biogeochemistry models (Sup-
plementary Table 18). The natural emission from ‘Inland water, estuar-
ies, coastal zones’ includes coastal upwelling50 and inland and coastal
