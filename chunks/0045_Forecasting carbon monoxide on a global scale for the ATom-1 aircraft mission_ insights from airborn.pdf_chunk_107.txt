centrations in the North Atlantic and Alaskan regions show a
positive correlation with Siberian biomass burning and large
interannual variability. In contrast, both MODIS AOT and
the MOPITT CO column show above-average values for the
tropical Atlantic in 2016. This suggests that the high values
of CO and aerosols from biomass burning encountered dur-
