mesoscale ocean circulations on these chemical and biologi-
cal processes.

Benchmarks for modeling and satellite retrievals
The range of scales and types of processes that can presently
be captured by both satellites and models, and the extent to
which they were integrated into EUREC4A’s experimental
design (see Bony et al., 2017), allows EUREC4A to address
