proﬁle of the mean bias in J values is shown in Fig. 3. As ex-
pected the ClSky and AvCld methods show opposite biases
and large rms errors. The CF3/2 method produces reasonable
averages, but still has rms errors of 10 % or more. The AvDir
method does not perform as well as expected and looks only
slightly better than CF3/2; however, the proﬁle of mean er-
ror (Fig. 3) is preferable to that of CF3/2. Both QCA meth-
ods performed excellently and deliver rms errors of less than
