Proﬁles
For P-O3 proﬁles (top row, Fig. 3), the discrepancy between
models and measurements is stark. The models (less GISS)
present a consistent picture of one world, while the ATom
proﬁles describe an entirely different world. In the central Pa-
ciﬁc at 8–12 km, the ATom-1 results tend to agree with mod-
els, showing ozone production of about 1 ppb/d. Below 8 km,
ATom’s P-O3 increases to a peak of 4 ppb/d at 2 km, while
the models’ P-O3 stays constant down to 4 km and then de-
