Tables of effective climate forcings, 1850â€“2100
CO2, CH4 and N2O forcings are calculated with analytic for-
mulae of Hansen et al. (2000). CH4 forcing includes the fac-
tor 1.4 to convert adjusted forcing to effective forcing, thus
incorporating the estimated effect of a CH4 increase on tro-
pospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapor. Our CH4 ad-
17Wetlands compose a majority of natural CH4 emissions and
are estimated to be equivalent to about 36 % of the anthropogenic
