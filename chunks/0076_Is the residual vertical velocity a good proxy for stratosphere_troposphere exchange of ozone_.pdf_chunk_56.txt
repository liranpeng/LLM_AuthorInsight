Interannual variability is calculated from the normalized 12 month running mean of the hemispheric O3
ﬂuxes and shown for all methods using C29 (Figure 1h) and C36 (Figure 1i). Note that the values plotted for
1 July 2000 are the average of January through December 2000, and the multiyear means and correlations
are given in Table 1. Correlation coeﬃcients (listed below under IA-r in Table 1 and the r values discussed
