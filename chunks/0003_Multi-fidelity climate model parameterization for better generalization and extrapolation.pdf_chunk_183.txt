moisture tendency at vertical levels 494 and 761 hPa, we still have some good agreement between the uncertainty and the MAE
variations while more significant discrepancies are observed mostly within the tropics and temperate zone (figures 13.e - 13.f
and 14.e - 14.f). The SF-HF-RPN’s uncertainty also shows more important mismatches for the moisture tendency compared to
the model’s MAE for the vertical levels 494 and 761 hPa compared to the 259 hPa level (figures 15.d - 15.f).
