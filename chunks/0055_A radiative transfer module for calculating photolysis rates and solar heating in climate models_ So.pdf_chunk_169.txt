An-
other inquiry is to test some of the published, simpler models
for water vapor absorption against RRTMG-SW. A larger
project will be to put Solar-J into a climate model and eval-
uate how errors in modeling solar radiation may affect the
climate simulations.
Code availability. The most recent version of Solar-J can be found
at ftp://128.200.14.8/public/junoh/Solar-J/. A complete version of
Solar-J code and data, along with some stand-alone test cases, is
