B1 scenario, the corresponding number for A1B is 9 ppbv
(Fig. 2; note that the ﬁgure shows the unscaled response of
a 5 % emission perturbation). The relative O3 impact from
AIR peaks in the upper troposphere and could exceed 8 % in
2050 A1B, compared to less than 4 % in 2050 B1. This large
spread in O3 impacts from AIR reﬂects the strong uncertain-
ties associated with possible future developments of emis-
sions. There are also uncertainties caused by differences be-
