mass coupling is through “super-cycling”.
A similar approach has been taken in the scheme of SLFV-
SL developed at LMD (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dy-
namique, Paris, France) for a hexagonal icosahedral grid-
based model. It uses simpliﬁed swept areas with simpliﬁed
integration of linear reconstruction functions as in ICON-
FFSL. Contrary to ICON-FFSL, the SLFV schemes base
their reconstruction on averaging six gradients (or ﬁve for
the pentagons) rather than a least-squares ﬁt. SLFV-SL uses a
