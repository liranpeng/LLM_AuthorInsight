ﬁnd that temperature, water vapor, stratospheric ozone col-
umn, biomass burning and lightning NOx are the dominant
sources of interannual changes in methane lifetime in all
three models. We also evaluate each model’s response to
forcings that have impacts on decadal time scales, such as
methane feedback, and anthropogenic emissions. In general,
these different CTMs show similar sensitivities to the driving
variables. We construct a parametric model that reproduces
