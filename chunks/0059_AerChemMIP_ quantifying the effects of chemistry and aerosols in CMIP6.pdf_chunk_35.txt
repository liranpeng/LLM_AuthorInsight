W. J. Collins et al.: AerChemMIP: quantifying the effects of chemistry and aerosols in CMIP6
components were largely derived from a multimodel en-
semble through the Aerosol Comparison (AeroCom) initia-
tive (Schulz et al., 2006; Myhre et al., 2013b). AeroCom
is a long-standing activity of aerosol model intercomparison
(Textor et al., 2006; Kinne et al., 2006; Schulz et al., 2006),
which provided estimates of radiative forcings from a large
