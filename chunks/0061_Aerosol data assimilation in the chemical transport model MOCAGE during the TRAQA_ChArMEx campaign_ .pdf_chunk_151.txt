results as expected occurred when the shape of the vertical
proﬁle was correctly simulated by the direct (unassimilated)
model. The shape of the aerosol vertical proﬁles does not
change during one assimilation cycle because AOD observa-
tions do not contain any vertical information, but the proﬁle
shape can change and be improved by the AOD assimilation
because different parts of the column can be carried by winds
from different directions. The AOD assimilation can also im-
