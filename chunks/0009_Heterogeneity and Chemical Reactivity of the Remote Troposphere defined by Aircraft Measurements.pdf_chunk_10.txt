and this can be traced to lower NOx levels than observed. At-
taching photochemical reactivities to measurements of chem-
ical species allows for a richer, yet more constrained-to-
what-matters, set of metrics for model evaluation.

Prologue
This paper is based on the methods and results of papers
that established an approach for analyzing aircraft mea-
surements, speciÔ¨Åcally the NASA Atmospheric Tomogra-
phy Mission (ATom), with global chemistry models. Here
