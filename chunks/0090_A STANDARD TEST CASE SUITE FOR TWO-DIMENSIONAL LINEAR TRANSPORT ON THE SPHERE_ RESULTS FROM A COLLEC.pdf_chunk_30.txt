Transport equation forms and discretization
categories
The continuity equation for a passive and inert scalar φ can
be written in various forms such as ﬂux form or advective
form. The choice of the form of the continuous transport
equation from which the discretized scheme is derived ob-
viously depends on the numerical method. Below we de-
