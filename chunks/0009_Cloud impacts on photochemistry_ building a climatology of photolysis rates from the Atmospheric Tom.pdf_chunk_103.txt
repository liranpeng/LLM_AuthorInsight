generate four quadrature column atmospheres (QCAs), and
to calculate four J values, which are then averaged to get a
single J value. In either case, the radiative transfer solution is
1-D and there is one J value per grid cell given to the chem-
istry module (and analyzed here).
What would the probability distribution rlnJ look like if we
used the UCI J values from the QCAs before averaging? For
this, we collect the statistics on total COD for the two geo-
