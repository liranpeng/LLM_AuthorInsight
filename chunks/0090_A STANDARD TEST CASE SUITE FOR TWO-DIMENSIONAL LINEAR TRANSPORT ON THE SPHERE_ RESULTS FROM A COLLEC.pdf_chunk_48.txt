optimal value for the coefﬁcient scaling this diffusion term
based on qualitative evaluation of results from other tests is
used (see Skamarock and Gassmann, 2011).
The time stepping is based on a three-stage Runge–Kutta
method. Hence the ﬂux operators are evaluated at three inter-
mediate time levels for a full tracer time step update. Shape
preservation is obtained by applying the FCT limiter/ﬁlter
during the ﬁnal Runge–Kutta stage within a given time step.
