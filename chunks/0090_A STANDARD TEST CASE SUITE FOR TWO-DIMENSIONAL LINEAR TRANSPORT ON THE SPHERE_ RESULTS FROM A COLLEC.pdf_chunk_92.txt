(Kaas et al., 2013). In HEL the Lagrangian solution, based on
tracing Lagrangian parcels (effectively solving Dφ/Dt = 0),
is used to nudge the Eulerian solution toward the Lagrangian
solution that exactly preserves tracer correlations and tracks
gradients very accurately. In the Lagrangian solution, mixing
between neighboring parcels is done using directionally bi-
ased diffusion based on the local deformation rate of the ﬂow.
The mixing is introduced to prevent long-term development
