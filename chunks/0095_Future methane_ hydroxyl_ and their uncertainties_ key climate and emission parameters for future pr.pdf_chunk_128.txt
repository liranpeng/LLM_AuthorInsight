climate and emission components are zero or negative, with
water vapor having the largest effect (−12.9±3.1 %). Strato-
spheric ozone and lightning NOx contribute little to τCH4×OH
changes, but they make a signiﬁcant contribution to the un-
certainty. MAGICC predicts similar τCH4×OH changes to the
parametric model because its temperature response is simi-
lar to the combined effects of temperature and water vapor
in our work, and sensitivities to the other dominant terms –
