some disagreement in detailed patterns and positioning should be
expected. The similarity between the first and the third columns
highlights the role of the mean UNet prediction in forming large-
scale coherent structures, such as the positioning of rainbands
within typhoon Haikui (2023), top row, and frontal systems, bottom
row. The additional fine-scale structure reflecting the stochastic
physics contributed by the diffusion model is seen in the third
