deduced from the top-down estimates, in which the inversion-based 
soil emissions increased at a faster rate than suggested by the IPCC 
Tier 1 emission factor14 (which assumes a linear response), especially 
after 2009 (ref. 18). The remaining causes of the increase are attributed 
to other direct anthropogenic sources (6%) and perturbed fluxes from 
changes in climate, CO2 or land cover (8%). The contribution from fossil 
fuel and industry emissions decreased rapidly between 1980 and 2000,
