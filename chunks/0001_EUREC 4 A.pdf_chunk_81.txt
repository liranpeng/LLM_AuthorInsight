Figure 6. Vertical latent-heat (vaporization enthalpy) ﬂux as a func-
tion of time and height above the platform as measured from the
combination of water vapor Raman lidar (ARTHUS) and Doppler
wind lidar aboard the R/V MS-Merian. The mean value over the 3 d
period is 100 W m−2 at 200 m, and the ﬂuxes are positive through-
out the sub-cloud layer.
