state x, the tangent linear operator has to satisfy

= 1.

As long as the perturbation δx is small enough that the per-
turbed state x + δx stays close to the model state x, the test
will give a value close to 1.
The adjoint operator (HT) is the transpose of the tangent-
linear operator, and it satisﬁes
⟨Hx,y⟩=
