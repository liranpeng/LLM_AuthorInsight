ozone precursor increase. An exception is the DLR E39C
model which yields a larger stratospheric ozone burden in
scenario 1c than in 1a, the difference “2 minus 1c” thus be-
ing more negative than “2 minus 1a”. One possible reason
might be that the NOx and methane increase leads to NOx-
and OH-catalyzed destruction in the stratosphere, which is
not compensated by the transport of the relatively low tropo-
spheric ozone increase in DLR E39C into the lower strato-
sphere.
