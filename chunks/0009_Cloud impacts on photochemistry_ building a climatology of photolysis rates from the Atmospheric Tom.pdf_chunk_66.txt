IFS, MOCA, NCAR, UCI, UCIb) show a much greater range
in Js, with a larger fraction perturbed by clouds (enhanced
or diminished by more than 10 %). The CAFS observa-
tions generally support this latter group. There are individual
model anomalies that may point to unusual features: MOCA
alone has a peak frequency of enhanced Js at rlnJ âˆ¼0.05 in
the free troposphere; three models (NCAR, UCI, UCIb) show
the largest extended frequency of |rlnJ| > 0.10 in the middle
