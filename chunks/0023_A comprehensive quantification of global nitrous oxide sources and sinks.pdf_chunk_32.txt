assuming a nonlinear response to fertilizer nitrogen inputs under varied 
climate and soil conditions17,22. The nonlinear response is also likely to 
be associated with long-term nitrogen accumulation in agricultural 
soils from nitrogen fertilizer use and in aquatic systems from nitrogen 
loads (the legacy effect)18,23, which provides more substrate for microbial 
processes18,24. The increasing N2O emissions estimated by process-based
