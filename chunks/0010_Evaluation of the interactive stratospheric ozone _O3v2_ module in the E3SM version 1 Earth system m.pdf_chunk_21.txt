near the tropopause has an unknown climate impact. In the
present study, we correct this problematic approach with the
O3v2 chemistry module by replacing the tropospheric over-
writing with a tropospheric tracer that is passive except in
the lowest four layers (below 1 km altitude) where it is re-
moved with a 48 h e-folding decay to 30 ppb (parts per bil-
lion by mole fraction). The choice of 30 ppb gives Linoz a
tropospheric ozone mass similar to full chemistry models and
