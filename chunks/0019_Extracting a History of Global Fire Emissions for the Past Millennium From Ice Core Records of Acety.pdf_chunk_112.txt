millennium. Ice core gas records are among the only truly quantitative methods of inferring burning because
the atmosphere physically integrates emissions across the planet. In this study, we show that ice core records
of acetylene, ethane, and methane do not readily yield a single ﬁre history even allowing dramatic changes in
the distribution of ﬁres and vegetation types. Uncertainties in background geologic emissions of ethane and
