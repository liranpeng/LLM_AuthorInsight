findings point to growing N2O emissions in emerging economies—particularly Brazil, 
China and India. Analysis of process-based model estimates reveals an emerging  
N2O–climate feedback resulting from interactions between nitrogen additions and 
climate change. The recent growth in N2O emissions exceeds some of the highest 
projected emission scenarios3,4, underscoring the urgency to mitigate N2O emissions.
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a long-lived stratospheric ozone-depleting
