Chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs)
Atmospheric science
was complex, but
it was supported
by observations.
Effects were
straightforward
and proven:
excessive UV
exposure to
humans and
ecosystems.
Chemical substitutes
were available and
technologies
could be adapted
at reasonable cost.
Lack of
technology was
not an
impediment.
Resistance to science
was overcome
early (post 1974)
and stakeholders
were engaged
from the start.
