Methane (CH4) also affects O3 by increasing water (H2O) and
odd hydrogen species. Increasing H2O cools the middle atmo-
sphere, influences the chlorine cycle, and increases O3 produc-
tion in the troposphere. Model projections (Fleming et al., 2011)
indicate that CO2 will have the larger effect.
Limited references (Kanter et al., 2013; Ravishankara et al.,
2009) were cited in the critical review concerning whether and
how the MP could manage N2O and reduce O3 depletion. To
