imum of 6 ppbv over the North Atlantic Ocean during sum-
mer in 2050. The O3 impact of road trafﬁc emissions in the
lower troposphere peaks at 3 ppbv over the Arabian Penin-
sula, much lower than the impact in 2000.
Radiative forcing (RF) calculations show that the net
effect of AIR, SHIP and ROAD combined will change
from a marginal cooling of −0.44 ± 13 mW m−2 in 2000
to a relatively strong cooling of −32 ± 9.3 (B1) or
−32 ± 18 mW m−2 (A1B) in 2050, when taking into ac-
