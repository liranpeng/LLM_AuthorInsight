which is documented in Skamarock and Klemp (2008).
Two-dimensional least-squares-Ô¨Åt polynomials are used to
evaluate the higher order spatial derivatives needed to can-
cel the leading-order truncation error terms of the stan-
dard second-order centered formulation. As in Wicker and
Skamarock (2002), the third-order formulation is equivalent
to the fourth-order formulation plus an additional diffusion
term that is proportional to the Courant number (CN). An
