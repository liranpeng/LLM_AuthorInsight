and < 0.3 for J-NO2. A COD âˆ¼1 is not that large since these
clouds are highly forward scattering and have an isotropic-
equivalent optical depth that is 5 times smaller.

Averaging over clouds affects clear-sky fraction
Comparison of the CAFS-ATom measurements of J values
with modeled ones presents a fundamental disconnect, but
one that we must work through if we are to test the J values
in our chemistryâ€“climate models with measurements. A
