vergent wind ﬁeld so that the modeler is forced to consider
the coupling between air density and tracer mass (at least
when using ﬁnite-volume type schemes), which is a neces-
sary step in developing a transport scheme for realistic atmo-
spheric/oceanographic applications.
The idealized transport scheme testing discussed above
assesses simulation accuracy in a single-tracer setup. For
a range of climate and climate–chemistry problems, it
is also considered important that schemes do not disrupt
