HOMME
HOMME and CAM-SE use the same numerical model with
only a difference in the choice of order p = NP−1 of polyno-
mial basis functions, hyperviscosity coefﬁcient ν, and hyper-
viscosity scaling η. The resolution is obtained via Eq. (A1).
For HOMME simulations, we choose p = 3 because of its
common use (see CAM-SE default parameters) and p = 6 to
demonstrate performance for the higher order scheme. If one
