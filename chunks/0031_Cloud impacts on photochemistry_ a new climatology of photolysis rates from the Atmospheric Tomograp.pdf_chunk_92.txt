times larger occurrence of cloud dimming in the boundary
layer. These differences could be caused by GMI calculat-
ing J values with a single-column atmosphere (SCA) con-
taining clouds with Briegleb (CF3/2) averaging and UCI cal-
culating J values with four quadrature column atmospheres
(QCAs); see Table 1. Unfortunately, when UCI mimics the
B-averaging (with model UCIb), the differences remain. See
further discussion of Fig. S6 in Sect. 4.1.
