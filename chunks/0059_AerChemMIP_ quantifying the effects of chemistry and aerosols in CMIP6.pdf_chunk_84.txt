3.1.2
Transient historical prescribed SST simulations
In order to calculate the transient ERFs that drive the above
climate changes, a set of simulations repeats the above sen-
sitivity runs in Sect. 3.1.1, but using atmosphere-only con-
ﬁgurations with prescribed sea-surface temperatures (SSTs)
and sea ice. The SSTs and sea ice should be speciﬁed as
the monthly mean time-evolving values from one ensemble
