solve them all, and most codes do not even count them all (Räisänen et al., 2004). RRTMG randomly selects 
an ICA for each wavelength bin in the RT solution, a method designated Monte Carlo ICA (McICA, Pincus 
et al., 2003). McICA has errors at each time step by mixing ICAs across wavelengths and by not accurately 
sampling the average of ICAs (e.g., average cloud optical depth) in that time step. McICA is intended to de-
