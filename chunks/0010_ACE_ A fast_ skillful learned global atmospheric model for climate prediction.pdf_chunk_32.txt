span of this previously unseen forcing dataset (Figure 4a). This is particularly impressive because the
climatological SST used to generate training data spans 1982-2012 and so the realistic SST dataset
includes temperatures warmer than any in the training dataset. When forced with the realistic SST
dataset, ACE has a cold near-surface temperature bias which is particularly amplified over land where
