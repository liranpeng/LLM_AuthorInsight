a week, a season, and a year, using a decade of observa-
tions (Sect. 5.1). These statistics present a useful climatol-
ogy for testing the means and perhaps standard deviations
(see Chang and Hanna (2004) for more examples), but ex-
treme high- and low-probability events are not so useful as a
climatology (Sect. 3.2). The characterization of AQX events
as large-scale, multiday episodes is investigated with cluster-
ing algorithms (Sect. 5.2), and we develop climate statistics
