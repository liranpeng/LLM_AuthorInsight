SF-HF-RPN show that the latter resolves better the moisture convection stochasticity for vertical levels below 494 hPa, while it
does not improve upon the deterministic NN. for higher levels (figure 6.b).
The CRPS curves follow a similar trend as the MAE ones (see Results), showing that all RPN-based models have similar
confidence in terms of variance prediction (figure 6). This behavior could be expected since all these models are based on the
