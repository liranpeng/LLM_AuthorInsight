pospheric ozone production, stratospheric ozone chemistry,
aerosol oxidation, and the lifetimes of each other.
The historical increases in aerosols and tropospheric ozone
have inhomogeneous spatial distributions, and the degree
of regional temperature and precipitation responses to such
heterogeneous forcing remains an open question within the
scientiÔ¨Åc community which these experiments and their
pairwise ERF experiments described in Sect. 3.1.2 should
