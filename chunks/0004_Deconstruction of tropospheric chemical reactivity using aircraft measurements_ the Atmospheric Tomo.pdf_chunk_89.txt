the spread is much larger, with ATom-1 largest in both the
Paciﬁc and Atlantic. For L-CO, the variation is different still,
with a relatively large spread: e.g., in the Paciﬁc, ATom-4 is
50 %–100 % larger than ATom-2.
Mean reactivity proﬁles for the three tropical basins are
shown in Figs. 33–36. Here the central Paciﬁc shows low
variability across the deployments (except for the P-O3 min-
imum in ATom-1), while the eastern Paciﬁc shows little range
