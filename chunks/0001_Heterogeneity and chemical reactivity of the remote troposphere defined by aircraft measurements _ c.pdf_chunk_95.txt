Charlton-Perez et al. (2009). ATom’s 10 s air parcels mea-
sure 2 km (horizontal) by 80 m (vertical) during most pro-
ﬁles. There are obviously some chemical structures below the
10 s air parcels. Only some ATom measurements are archived
at 1 Hz, and we examine a test case using 1 s data for O3
and H2O for a mid-ocean descent between Anchorage and
Kona in Fig. S2a. Some of the 1 s (200 m by 8 m) variability
is clearly lost with 10 s averaging, but 10 s averaging pre-
