mates exceed those of BECCS (Socolow et al., 2011; Smith
et al., 2016). Keith et al. (2006) have argued that, with strong
research and development support and industrial-scale pilot
projects sustained over decades, it may be possible to achieve
costs ∼USD 200 (tC)−1, thus comparable to BECCS costs;
however, other assessments are higher, reaching USD 1400–
3700 (tC)−1 (NAS, 2015a).
Enhanced weathering via soil amendment with crushed
silicate rock is a candidate negative emission technology that
