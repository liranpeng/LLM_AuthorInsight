For SAM, the 
√
w′w′ profile of deep convection is much more intense than that of other GSRMs, especially in the 
upper atmosphere (Fig. S9b; blue line). These differences in intensity statistics and vertical structure help explain 
the unusually wide extent of the deep convection cluster on the latent space projection (Fig. 3j, red cluster vs. all).
A further inspection of the GSRMs’ relative cluster proportions (Fig. S10) confirms this perspective. SPCAM
