the often-used test of the probability distribution of MDA8
O3 values over a region gives different results when testing a
hindcast model than when treating the identical model simu-
lation as climate statistics. Nevertheless, comparing the grid-
ded observations directly with the hindcast MDA8 O3 values
clearly deﬁnes model deﬁciencies in terms of biases, baseline
values (lowest percentiles at ocean boundaries), seasonality,
and the ability to predict the relative increase in O3 during
