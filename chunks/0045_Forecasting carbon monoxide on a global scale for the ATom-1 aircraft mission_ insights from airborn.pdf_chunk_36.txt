use the CO simulated with the assimilated wind ﬁelds, but
we note that similar features were seen for the CO simulated
with the forecast winds, as further discussed in Sect. 3.1.2.
For the model results, we do not apply temporal interpolation
between the model output frequency (6 h). Instead, we sam-
ple the model forecasts at the time closest to the midpoint of
each ﬂight segment. For comparison with observations, the 3-
D model forecast was interpolated to the longitude, latitude,
