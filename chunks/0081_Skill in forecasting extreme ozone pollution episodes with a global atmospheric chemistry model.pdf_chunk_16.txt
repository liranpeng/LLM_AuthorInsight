the observations to the UCI CTM. We then identify the struc-
ture of the multiday, continental-scale pollution episodes that
make up most of these events. The CTMâ€™s ability to match
these extreme episodes is shown to have considerable skill,
which degrades as the quality of prediction of the cell de-
creases and as random noise is added to the observations.
In Sect. 5, we develop statistics of the extreme events from
a decade of observations that can be used without hindcast-
