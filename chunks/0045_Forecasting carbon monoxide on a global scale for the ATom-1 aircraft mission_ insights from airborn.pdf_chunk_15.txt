describes the model and observations used in this analysis.
Section 3 compares the GEOS-5 CO to observations. Sec-
tion 4 discusses the global distribution of CO and presents
the relative CO source contributions to the regions sampled
by ATom. Section 5 presents an analysis of the interannual
variability in CO and aerosol optical thickness seen in satel-
