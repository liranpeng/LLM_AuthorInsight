low-level (surface to 900 hPa) observed cloud enhancements
(rlnJ > 0.025) observed in the tropical PaciÔ¨Åc (particularly J-
O1D) do not appear in the models. Similarly cloud diminish-
ments in the upper troposphere do not appear with the mod-
eled cirrus. A more thorough analysis of the CAFS rlnJ with
the added deployments should examine if these differences
are due to 3-D radiative transfer effects, ocean albedo varia-
tions, or missing cloud types in the models. Perhaps, we will
