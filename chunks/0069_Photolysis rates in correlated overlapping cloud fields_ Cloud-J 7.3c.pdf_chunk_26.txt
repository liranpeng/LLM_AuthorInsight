A MAX group is characterized by the number of cloudy
columns (N1) consisting of combinations of cloudy or clear
sky in different layers of the group and having a fractional
area equal to f G1

sible) clear-sky column fraction of 1 −F G1, giving N1 + 1
ICAs for that group. As in the earlier Fast-J work (Neu et al.,
