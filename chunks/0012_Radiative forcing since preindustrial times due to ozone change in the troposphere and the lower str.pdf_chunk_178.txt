fect of increased water vapor swamped the effect of increased
stratosphere-troposphere exchange.
Important sources of disagreement among the models cal-
culating ozone change were already identiÔ¨Åed in a similar
study of Gauss et al. (2003) and include the different meteo-

mulations that are applied. This also includes stratosphere-
