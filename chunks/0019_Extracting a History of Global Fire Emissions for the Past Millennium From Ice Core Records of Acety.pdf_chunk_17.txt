been used to reconstruct trends in global ﬁre emissions over the past millennium (Figure 2) (Bock et al., 2017;
Ferretti et al., 2005; Mischler et al., 2009; Nicewonger et al., 2016, 2018, 2020; Sapart et al., 2012; Wang
et al., 2010). Methane has an 8‐ to 10‐year atmospheric lifetime and therefore the potential to provide a glob-
ally integrated signal of pyrogenic emissions. Ferretti et al. (2005) interpreted the methane isotope records
