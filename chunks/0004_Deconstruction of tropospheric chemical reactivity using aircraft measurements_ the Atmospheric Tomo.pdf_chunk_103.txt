Figure 21. Curtain plots of L-CO (ppb d−1) in the tropical eastern Paciﬁc (0–30◦N) for ATom-1234. See Fig. 6.
The sensitivity S of reactivity R to species X is calcu-
lated from the fractional change in R per fractional change in
X (dimensionless, e.g., percentage per percentage). We use
1 = 10 %.
S ≡d{ln(R)}
d{ln(X)} = ln(R [X · (1 + 1)]/R[X])
ln(1 + 1)
