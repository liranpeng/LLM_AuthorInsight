in the tropics and summer (northern) mid-latitudes as seen in
Fig. 3. For these regions the standard deviation across the
longitudinal samples is of order 6–11 %, whereas outside of
these, it is as large as 20 %, but the absolute values are small.
A similar pattern holds for L-O3 with standard deviations in
dominant regions of 6–14 %. Thus any single, fully sampled
longitudinal transect through this domain has a 68 % like-
lihood of being within 6–14 % of the mid-Paciﬁc average.
