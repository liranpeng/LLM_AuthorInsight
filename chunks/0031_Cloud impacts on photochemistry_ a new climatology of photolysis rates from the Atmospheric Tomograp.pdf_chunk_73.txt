sentative sampling from the models that would be repeatable
over time. It was not possible to acquire month-long or multi-
year diagnostics from all the models, and so with the avail-
able model results (24 h from a day in mid-August) we sub-
sample the broad tropical Paciﬁc block (20◦S–20◦N × 160–
240◦E) into a west (160–200◦E), east (200–240◦E), and
dateline (175–185◦E) block. The results of these subsampled
statistics are shown for J-NO2 in Fig. S7a (100–300 hPa)
