30 ppb) and extends beyond just polluted regions. The winter
domain model correlation coefﬁcient (MCC) derived from
the daily time series of MDA8, shown in Fig. 6e–f, shows
relatively good model hindcasting with an average MCC of
0.47 ± 0.13 for the US and 0.61 ± 0.10 for EU. MCC is
greatest for the most part where QP is large and lowest in
coastal areas. For wintertime, most of the variability is driven
synoptically by large-scale gradients in background O3.
