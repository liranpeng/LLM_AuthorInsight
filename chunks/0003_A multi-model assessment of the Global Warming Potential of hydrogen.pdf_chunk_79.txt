Table 5 summarize the changes in atmospheric composition and effective radiative
forcing due to hydrogen only (PERT_H2-CTRL), and methane only (PERT_CH4-
CTRL), respectively.
For total ozone, stratospheric water vapor, and aerosols, radiative forcing is
calculated ofï¬‚ine for the PERT_H2 and PERT_CH4 relative to CTRL.
