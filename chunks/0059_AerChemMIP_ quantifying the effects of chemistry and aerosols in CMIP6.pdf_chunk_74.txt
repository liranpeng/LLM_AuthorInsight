Table 1. List of historical coupled-ocean experiments. Experiments cover the period between 1850 and 2014, except hist-1950HC, which
starts in 1950. The “AER” sufﬁx means models should at least calculate tropospheric aerosols driven by emission ﬂuxes. The “CHEMS”
sufﬁx means at least stratospheric chemistry is required. Models should always be run with the maximum complexity available. The species
