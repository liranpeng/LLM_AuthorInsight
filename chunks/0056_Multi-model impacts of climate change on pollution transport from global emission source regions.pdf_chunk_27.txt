to reduced convective mass ï¬‚uxes and that reduced CO-tracer
mixing ratios in the Southern Hemisphere were most likely
a response to a weaker Hadley circulation and reduced inter-
hemispheric exchange (Fang et al., 2011). A large increase in
CO-tracer mixing ratios near the tropopause was suggested
to arise from the upward migration of the tropopause (Fang
et al., 2011). This study focussed on annual-mean distribu-
tions. Similarly, the trends in mixing ratios of a 90-day e-
