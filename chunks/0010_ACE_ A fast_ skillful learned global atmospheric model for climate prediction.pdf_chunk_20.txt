formulate baselines using our physics-based model. Two cases will be considered: first a “reference"
perfect emulator in which we compare members of the initial condition ensemble against each other,
giving an upper bound on model skill. Because of the chaotic nature of the atmosphere and the
limited duration (10 years) of our validation dataset, even a perfect emulator will have non-zero
errors. Second, we run a difficult-to-beat 200 km “baseline”: the same physics-based FV3GFS model
