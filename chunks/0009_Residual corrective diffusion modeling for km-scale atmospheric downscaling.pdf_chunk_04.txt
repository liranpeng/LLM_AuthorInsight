resolution ratio, different physics and synthesize new channels, we
employ a two-step approach. A deterministic model first predicts
the mean, followed by a generative diffusion model that predicts
the residual. The model exhibits encouraging deterministic and
probabilistic skills, spectra and distributions that recover power law
relationships in the target data. In case studies of coherent weather
phenomena, it sharpens gradients in cold fronts and intensifies
