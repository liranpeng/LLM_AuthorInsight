chemistry. Three of the models do not include stratospheric
chemistry reactions (TM4, p-TOMCAT, LMDzINCA). The
number of species ranged from 42 (TM4) to 125 (LMDz-
INCA). LMDzINCA and TM4 used their own biogenic and
oceanic emissions, respectively (see below).

TM4
The KNMI chemistry transport model TM4 (van Noije et al.,
2006a,b) is driven by ECMWF analysed meteorology and
contains a chemistry scheme derived from the Carbon Bond
Mechanism reaction scheme (CBM4) (Houweling et al.,
