For both the Atlantic and Paciﬁc basins, the reactivities (L-
O3, L-CH4, and L-CO) generally follow the Sun, with more
southerly hot parcels in ATom-23 (February, October) and
northerly hot parcels in ATom-14 (August, May). The P-
O3 hotspots have no simple seasonality, being dominated
by middle- to upper-tropospheric regions with high NOx
presumably from the outﬂow of deep convection from the
nearby continents.
Because the eastern Paciﬁc ﬂights (∼121◦W) are clearly
