by NH air, explaining its non-sinusoidal cycle when com-
pared with SPO and CGO. Also shown is the annual cycle
for the modeled eCO2 scenario (∼0.18 ppm, dotted lines for
SMO and SPO). That for the sCO2 scenario is even smaller
(∼0.06 ppm) and is not shown. It is interesting that the SH
annual cycles in eCO2 are similar in shape to those observed,
even catching the double peak at SMO, but the magnitude is
much smaller. There is no evidence in our direct modeling or
