Our evaluation consists of the CESM (high-fidelity) Super-
parameterized Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (SP-
CAM5) in a real geography setup (Methods). Unlike CAM5,
SPCAM5 nearly explicitly resolves atmospheric moist con-
vection (including deep convection) by using idealized em-
bedded cloud resolving models64,65, introducing less physical
approximations. Both models incorporate the CAM radiation
