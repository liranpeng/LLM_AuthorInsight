Even under limited global mean warming scenarios, the
frequency of heat waves may increase.275–277 A warmer climate
is projected to decrease rainfall over southern Europe, creating
wintertime deﬁcits that lowers soil water content for the
following seasons, contributing to extreme summertime heat
wave conditions.278 A few studies have emphasized positive
feedbacks from vegetation (higher emissions and lower stomatal
deposition) during heat waves.197,278,279 Furthermore, the
