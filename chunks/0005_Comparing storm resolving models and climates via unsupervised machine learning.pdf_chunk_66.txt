Â­buoyancy46,47. When these formulations are ultimately used to calculate vertical velocity, they could be causing 
the deviations between models in the intensity of updraft speeds. We believe there is a high chance these specific 
distinctions between parameterizations could be causing the split in the dynamics of the GSRMs. However, 
further investigation is needed to confirm the true root causes of the differences between GSRMs we have 
identified.
