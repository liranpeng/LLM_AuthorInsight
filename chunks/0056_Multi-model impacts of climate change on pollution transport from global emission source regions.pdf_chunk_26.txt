four continental regions and their outﬂow locations (Doherty
et al., 2013).
A detailed analysis by Fang et al. (2011) used a global
CO-like tracer with a ﬁrst-order 25-day lifetime and global
anthropogenic CO emissions to investigate changes in trans-
port under the SRES A1B scenario between 1981–2000 and
2081–2100 using the GFDL AM3 chemistry–climate model
(CCM). They found that CO-tracer mixing ratios increased at
the surface and decreased in the tropical free troposphere due
