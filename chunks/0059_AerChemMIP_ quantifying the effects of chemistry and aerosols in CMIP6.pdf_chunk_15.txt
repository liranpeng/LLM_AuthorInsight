ponents of the ERF due to past methane emissions comes
from the associated increase in tropospheric ozone (Prather
et al., 2001; Stevenson et al., 2013). In addition, stratospheric
ozone losses due to ODSs since the 1970s have led to a
signiÔ¨Åcant cooling of the stratosphere (Shine et al., 2003;
McLandress et al., 2015), and the Antarctic ozone hole is
linked to changes in tropospheric circulation and rainfall pat-
terns in the Southern Hemisphere, especially during austral
