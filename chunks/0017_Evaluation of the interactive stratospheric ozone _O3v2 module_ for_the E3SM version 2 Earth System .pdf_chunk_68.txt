not record daily ozone values and cannot be assessed here.
The O3v1 ozone hole area is generally about 30 % smaller
than the observation (Fig. 5b) and also about 30 DU less deep
than observed from August through November (Fig. 5c).
O3v2 clearly matches the observations better both in terms of
area and minimum value. The clear improvement with O3v2
is the onset of the hole, where O3v1 shows almost a 2-week
delay but O3v2 matches the observations. We must be careful
