The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) instrument on the Aqua satellite provides column
aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data beginning in 2002. We
use MODIS data in this analysis because they provide a rel-
atively long data record. We use the Collection 6 level 2
(MYD04_L2) (Levy et al., 2015) 550 nm AOT data over
oceans aggregated into 0.5â—¦grid boxes and then take monthly
means with the daily data weighted according to the quality
assurance.
