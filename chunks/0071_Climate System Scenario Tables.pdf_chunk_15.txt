cursors. Such differences are discussed in the relevant chapters and 
noted in the tables.
For each species, the abundances (given as dry air mole fraction: ppm 
= micromoles per mole (10–6); ppb = nanomoles per mole (10–9); and 
ppt = picomoles per mole (10–12)), burdens (global total in grams, 1 Tg 
= 1012 g), average column amount (1 Dobson Unit (DU) = 2.687 × 1016
