Overall, the MF-RPN model returns more trustworthy uncertainty quantification compared to the LF-RPN and SF-HF-RPN
models. Hence, aggregating different datasets with different fidelity levels and of different climates through a well-designed
multi-fidelity surrogate model does not only improve the parameterizationâ€™s deterministic and statistical error metrics, but also
