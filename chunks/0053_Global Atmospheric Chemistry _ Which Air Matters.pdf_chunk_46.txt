is an intermediate source of atomic O in many tropospheric
reactions, and its net production and loss is determined in the
long term by the breaking and reforming of the O–O bond
originating with molecular oxygen. Chemical reactions are
traditionally grouped into production (P-O3, ppb day−1),
HO2 + NO →NO2 + OH,
(R2a)
RO2 + NO →NO2 + RO,
(R2b)
where NO2 + hν →NO + O and O + O2 →O3,
(R2c)
O2 + hν →O + O(×2),
(R2d)
and loss (L-O3, ppb day−1).
O3 + OH →O2 + HO2,
(R3a)
O3 + HO2 →HO + O2 + O2,
(R3b)
