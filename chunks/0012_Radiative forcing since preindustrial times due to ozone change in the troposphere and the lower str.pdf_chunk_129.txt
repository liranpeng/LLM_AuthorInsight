based on the ozone changes obtained in this study. For com-
parison, radiative forcing results from a similar study made
by Harvard University will be presented.
For radiative forcing we follow the deﬁnition of IPCC-
TAR chapter 6 (Ramaswamy et al., 2001), which includes the
stratospheric temperature adjustment.
Calculations where
the stratospheric temperature adjustment is excluded are ex-
plicitly denoted as “instantaneous radiative forcing”.
