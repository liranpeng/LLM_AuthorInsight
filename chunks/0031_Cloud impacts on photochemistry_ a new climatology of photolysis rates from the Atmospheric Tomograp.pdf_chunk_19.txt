ing how the observational statistics are compiled, what proto-
col the models used, and how they included cloud ﬁelds. This
section also documents the differences in mean J values,
which can be as large as 30 % in either “cloudy” or clear
conditions. Section 3 introduces the statistical distributions
based on the ratio of full sky including clouds to clear sky.
Section 4 examines modeling errors and improvements re-
lated to this comparison. In the concluding section, Sect. 5,
