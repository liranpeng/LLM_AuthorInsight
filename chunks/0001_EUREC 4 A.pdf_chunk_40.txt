remote sensing and surface ﬂux measurements, the environ-
ment and its clouds would be better constrained.
Quantifying day-to-day variations in both cloudiness and
its environment opened the door to additional questions,
greatly expanding EUREC4A’s scope. In addition to testing
hypothesized cloud-feedback mechanisms, EUREC4A’s ex-
perimental plan was augmented to (i) quantify the relative
role of micro- and macrophysical factors in rain formation;
