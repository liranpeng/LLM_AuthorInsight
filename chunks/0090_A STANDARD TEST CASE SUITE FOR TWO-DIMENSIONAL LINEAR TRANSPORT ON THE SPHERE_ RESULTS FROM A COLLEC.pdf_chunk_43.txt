to integrate a polynomial of degree K2, only integration of
polynomials of degree K is needed.
For most applications it is important that the progno-
sis of mixing ratio φ does not introduce spurious oscilla-
tions and/or unphysical values such as negative mixing ra-
tios. Schemes that guarantee “physical” solutions in this
sense are referred to as “shape-preserving” (sp). The en-
forcement of shape preservation in ﬂux-form schemes can
be done by adjusting the ﬂuxes. A very popular algorithm
