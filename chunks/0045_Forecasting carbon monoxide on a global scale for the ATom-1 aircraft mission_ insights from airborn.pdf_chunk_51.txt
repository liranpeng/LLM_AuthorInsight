timing of the plumes.
Non-BB sources dominate the background CO levels on
all three ﬂights. However, biomass burning plays a dominant
role in the plumes of high CO (Fig. 2g–i). South American
biomass burning leads to CO enhancements between T 14
and T 16 of the Punta Arenas–Ascension Island ﬂight. In the
later portion of that ﬂight, biomass burning from Africa leads
to strong CO plumes. Strong plumes of African biomass
burning are also seen at the beginning of the Ascension
