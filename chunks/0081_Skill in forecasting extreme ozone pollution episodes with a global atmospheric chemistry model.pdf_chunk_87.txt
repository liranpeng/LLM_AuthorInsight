rent sampling (Exact). Left column (a, c) is US and right column
(b, d) is EU. Top row (a, b) shows the PDFs for winter months
(DJF), and bottom row (c, d) for summer months (JJA). The me-
dian of each PDF was subtracted prior to plotting and is listed in the

From Fig. 7 we conclude (correctly) that during summer the
CTM has a uniform bias of +30 ppb over the full range about
the median (âˆ’15 to +20 ppb), but that during winter it has
