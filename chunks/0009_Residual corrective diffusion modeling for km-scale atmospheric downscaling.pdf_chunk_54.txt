factors in the diffusion training process including the noise
schedules used, the comparatively large resolution (448 × 488)
compared to typical image generation (64 × 64), or the weighting
in the loss function.
To become useful for km-scale weather prediction, extensions of
CorrDiff are encouraged that include temporal coherence, such as
via video diffusion or learnt autoregressive km-scale dynamics; as
with super-resolution these must be formulated as stochastic
