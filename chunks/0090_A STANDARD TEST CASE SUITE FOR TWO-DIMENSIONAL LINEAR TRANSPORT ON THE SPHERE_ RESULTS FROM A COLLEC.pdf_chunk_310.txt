obtain by solving
∇x

y = φi −φ0,

where di = P(rk,i) −rk is the position vector of the pro-
jected neighboring centroid rk,i relative to rk, and φi (resp.
φ0) is the value of the scalar ﬁeld φ at rk,i (resp. rk). The gra-
dients ∇k,iφ are then averaged to get ∇kφ. We have veriﬁed
that this yields a ﬁrst-order approximation of the gradient on
non-optimized grids.
