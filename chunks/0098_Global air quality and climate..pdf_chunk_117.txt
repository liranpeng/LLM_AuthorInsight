regional shifts in emissions occur. We conclude that the emission-
driven changes across all available scenarios up to 2050 generally
span a wider range than the climate-driven changes;240 Fig. 3).
The large spatial regions considered here and the coarse
resolution of the models may mask oppositely signed changes
within smaller regions (e.g., within megacities, whose emis-
sions may increase even under emission control scenarios with
nationally declining total emissions291). Most models do not
