Rising temperatures increase the rate of CO2 and CH4 re-
lease from drying soils, thawing permafrost (Schädel et al.,
2016; Schuur et al., 2015) and warming continental shelves
(Kvenvolden, 1993; Judd et al., 2002), and affect the ocean
carbon cycle as noted above. Crowther et al. (2016) synthe-
size results of 49 ﬁeld experiments across North America,
Europe and Asia, inferring that every 1 ◦C global mean soil
surface warming can cause a 30 PgC soil carbon loss and sug-
