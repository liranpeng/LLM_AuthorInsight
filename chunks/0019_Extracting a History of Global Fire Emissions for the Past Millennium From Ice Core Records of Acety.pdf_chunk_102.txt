burning required for these compounds relative to that for the longer‐lived methane, which is
insensitive to the location of emissions. The required dry matter burned from acetylene and ethane is
signiﬁcantly reduced and there is better agreement between the inferred dry matter burned histories
from all the gases. It is important to emphasize that this is an extreme, and climatically unrealistic case,
