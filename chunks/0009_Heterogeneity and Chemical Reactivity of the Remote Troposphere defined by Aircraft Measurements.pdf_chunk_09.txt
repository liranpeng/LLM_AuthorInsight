from the 2 km ATom data, indicating that much of the het-
erogeneity in tropospheric chemistry can be captured with
current global chemistry models. Comparing the ATom reac-
tivities over the tropical oceans with climatological statistics
from six global chemistry models, we ﬁnd excellent agree-
ment with the loss of O3 and CH4 but sharp disagreement
with production of O3. The models sharply underestimate O3
production below 4 km in both Paciﬁc and Atlantic basins,
