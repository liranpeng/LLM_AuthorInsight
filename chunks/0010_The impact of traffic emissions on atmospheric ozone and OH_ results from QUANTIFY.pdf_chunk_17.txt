The EU-project QUANTIFY (Quantifying the Climate
Impact of Global and European Transport Systems) is the
ﬁrst attempt to provide an integrated and consistent view on
the effects of trafﬁc on various aspects of the atmosphere.
Fuglestvedt et al. (2008) calculated that transport accounts
for 31% of the man made ozone forcing since preindustrial
times. Here we present simulations obtained with six differ-
ent models all using the same set of emissions to provide a
