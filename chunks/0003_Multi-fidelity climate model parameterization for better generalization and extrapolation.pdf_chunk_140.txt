for the vertical levels where the deterministic NN shows nearly zero to slightly negative R2 values (from 494 to 897 hPa), the
SF-HF-RPN does significantly improve upon the deterministic NN, showing the ability of the RPN surrogate model to resolve
part of the convection stochasticity.
For the moisture tendency and as mentioned in the Results section, the negative R2 values for the deterministic NN. and
