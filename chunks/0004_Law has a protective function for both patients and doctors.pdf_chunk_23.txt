errors of diagnosis, depression
is
difficult to
diagnose in medically ill people, patients' priori-
ties alter often during the course of a life threat-
ening illness, hope can re-emerge from hopeless-
ness,
we
find
some
patients'
problems
overwhelming at times, and sometimes our judg-
ment is clouded by ignorance or fatigue. Why no
cries to enshrine in law the right of all patients to
a second
opinion
if their
suffering remains
intractable for a week? Why call for legalising
carelessness?
