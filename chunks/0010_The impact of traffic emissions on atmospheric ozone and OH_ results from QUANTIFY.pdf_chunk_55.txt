Most anthropogenic emissions were taken from the
EDGAR3.2FT2000 database. The effective injection height
of biomass burning emissions into the atmosphere was taken
into account with the emission heights calculated in the
RETRO (REanalysis of the TROpospheric chemical compo-
sition over the past 40 years) project. The lightning source
was determined interactively in LMDz-INCA with a mod-
iÔ¨Åed Price and Rind (1992) parameterization, and its total
