1, 2005 to July 1, 2018 and has a mean loss frequency of 0.84%/yr, corre-
sponding to a lifetime of 119 years. This lifetime is only slightly longer 
than the 117 years (118 years when rescaled to 320 ppb) reported in P2015 
for the period 2005–2010. The three models show different decadal shifts 
in N2O lifetime over the extended period: UCI has a clear long-term in-
crease (i.e., decreasing N2O loss); LMDz5 has a small decrease; and GMI
