modeling results were funded through 
the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring 
Service (https://atmosphere.copernicus.
eu/), implemented by ECMWF on 
behalf of the European Commission 
and were generated using computing 
resources from LSCE. The authors 
also acknowledge Ed Dlugokencky for 
providing the zonal surface N2O data 
that was used here to produce an obser-
vation-based reference with which to 
compare our simulated results. The au-
thors thank the anonymous reviewers
