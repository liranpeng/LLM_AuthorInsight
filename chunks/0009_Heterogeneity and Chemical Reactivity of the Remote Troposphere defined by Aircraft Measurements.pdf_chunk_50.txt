to the MDS. It is introduced in the Prologue, and the details
can be found in P2018. A model grid cell is initialized with
all the core reactive species needed for a regular chemistry
simulation. The model is then integrated over 24 h without
transport or mixing, without scavenging and without emis-
sions. Each global model uses its own varying cloud Ô¨Åelds
for the period to calculate photolysis rates, but the F0AM
box model simply takes the instant J values as measured
