ers for CO to assess the contribution of different emission
sources to the regions sampled by ATom-1 to elucidate the
dominant anthropogenic inﬂuences on different parts of the
remote atmosphere. We ﬁnd a dominant contribution from
non-biomass-burning sources along the ATom transects ex-
cept over the tropical Atlantic, where African biomass burn-
ing makes a large contribution to the CO concentration. One
of the goals of ATom is to provide a chemical climatology
