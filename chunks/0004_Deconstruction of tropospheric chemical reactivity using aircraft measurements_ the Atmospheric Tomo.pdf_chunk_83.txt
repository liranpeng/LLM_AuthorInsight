(R4) is not sensitive to cold temperatures. Only one of the
two Antarctic ﬂights had enough sunlight to produce much
reactivity (ATom-3, Fig. 28). Like the Arctic, P-O3 is con-
centrated in the upper troposphere, while L-O3 and L-CH4
are in the lower troposphere. Note that the color scale is 6 to
12 times smaller than in Figs. 6–25.
