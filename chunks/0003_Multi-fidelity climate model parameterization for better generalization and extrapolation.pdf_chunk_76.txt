CAM5 seasonal cycle.
Given the testing dataset defined above, a straightforward
choice for the low-fidelity CAM5 training dataset would be
to consider a +4K simulation as defined for SPCAM5 for
testing. However, low-fidelity data should not be defined with
the assumption of prior knowledge of the testing data, but
rather on the exploration of scenarios and regimes it provides
beyond those observed within the high-fidelity training data.
Hence, both CAM5 +4K and +8K are considered as potential
