Abstract Biomass burning is an important component of the Earth system in terms of global
biogeochemistry, atmospheric composition, climate, terrestrial ecology, and land use. This study examines
published ice core trace gas measurements of acetylene, ethane, and methane, which have been used
as proxies for paleoÔ¨Åre emissions. We investigate the consistency of these records for the past 1,000 years in
