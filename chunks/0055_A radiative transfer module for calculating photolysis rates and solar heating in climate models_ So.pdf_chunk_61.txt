for overhead sun (SZA = 0◦) is summarized in Table 4
and Fig. 2. Table 4 lists the band-by-band radiation bud-
get in W m−2, with Solar-J’s spectral bins labeled as S-bins
and RRTMG’s as B bands (B16–B29 follow the same band
numbers as in RRTMG’s codes). For easy comparison, sev-
eral Solar-J’s spectral bins of higher resolution from the UV
range are lumped together to best match the RRTMG’s bin
of similar range, and vice versa with RRTMG’s B24 and B25
