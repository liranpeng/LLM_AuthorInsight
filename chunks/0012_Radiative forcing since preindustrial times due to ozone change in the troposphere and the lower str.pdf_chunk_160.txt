surface albedo.
The University of L’Aquila radiative transfer model
(“ULAQ-RTM”) is the same as was used in Pitari et
al. (2002).
The thermal infrared scheme is an absorptiv-
ity/emissivity broad band model, explicitly including CO2,
H2O, O3 and aerosols. For the solar spectrum a δ-Eddington
code is used applying solar ﬂux absorption cross-sections and
including Rayleigh and Mie scattering effects. Temperature
and water vapor vertical proﬁles are those internally calcu-
