Here we report on this model-derived product that was pro-
posed for ATom, the daily averaged reaction rates determin-
ing the production and loss of O3 and the loss of CH4 for 10 s
averaged air parcels. We calculate these rates with 3D chem-
ical models that include variations in clouds and photolysis
and then assemble the statistical patterns describing the het-
erogeneity (i.e., high spatial variability) of these rates and the
underlying patterns of reactive gases.
