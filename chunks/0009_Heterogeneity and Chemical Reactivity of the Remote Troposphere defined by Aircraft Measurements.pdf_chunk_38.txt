documented the Supplement. Using the MDS, we have six
chemical models calculating the 24 h reactivities, producing
a reactivity data stream (RDS) using protocols noted in the
Prologue (P2017) and described further in Sect. 2. There, we
describe the updated modeling protocol RDS∗necessary to
address measurement noise in key species that can be very
short-lived. In Sect. 4, we examine the statistics of reactivity
over the Atlantic and Paciﬁc oceans, focusing on air parcels
