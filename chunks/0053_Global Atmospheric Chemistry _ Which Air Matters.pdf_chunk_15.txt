This heterogeneity of species and chemical reactivity (e.g.,
methane loss) is clearly structured and not simply Gaussian.
Its structure reﬂects the combined inﬂuence of meteorolog-
ical transport and mixing as well as the patterns that differ-
ent species are co-emitted and transformed around the globe.
For example, large plumes from industrial regions or biomass
burning when lofted into the free troposphere by deep con-
