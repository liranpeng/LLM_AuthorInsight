high-resolution spectral data for stratospheric ozone photol-
ysis and continually updated with new cross sections (Sander
et al., 2011), and tested against other codes (Palancar et al.,
2011; PhotoComp, Eyring et al., 2010), we have conﬁdence
in our stratospheric photolysis and heating rates.
The large bin 18 (412–778 nm) that includes the O3 Chap-
puis band is unusual for Cloud-J: it assumes a uniform ab-
sorption cross section for O3, and it has a large, factor of 2
