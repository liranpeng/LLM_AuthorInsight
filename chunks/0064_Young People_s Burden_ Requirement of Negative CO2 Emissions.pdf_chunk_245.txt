ing of sea ice and land ice. The von Schuckmann and
Le Traon (2011) analysis for 2005–2015 (Fig. 5) yields a
decade-average 0.7 W m−2 heat uptake in the upper 2 km
of the ocean; addition of the smaller terms raises the im-
balance to at least +0.8 W m−2 for 2005–2015, consistent
with the recent estimate of +0.9 ± 0.1 W m−2 by Trenberth
et al. (2016) for 2005–2015. Other recent analyses includ-
ing the most up-to-date corrections for ocean instrumental
