(cf. Fig. 28 of Hansen et al., 2016). Our present paper uses
these alternative metrics to help sharpen determination of the
dangerous level of global warming, and to quantify actions
that are needed to stabilize climate. We here use global tem-
perature as the principal metric because several reasons of
concern are scaled to global warming (O’Neill et al., 2017),
including speciﬁcally the potential for slow feedbacks such
