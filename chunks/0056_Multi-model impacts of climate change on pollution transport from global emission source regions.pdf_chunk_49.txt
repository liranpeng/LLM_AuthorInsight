tributions show the effect of deep convection in the trop-
ics and synoptic and convective lifting over mid-latitudes.
There is a strong seasonality in the CO-tracer distributions,
which is driven by both the seasonality of CO source emis-
sions (Fig. 1) and seasonal changes in transport. In the trop-
ics, the largest CO-tracer mixing ratios occur during boreal
winter (DJF), hereinafter winter (Fig. 2), compared to boreal
summer (JJA), hereinafter summer (Fig. 3). In the northern
