AIR with time. The reason is that increased emissions nor-
mally leads to a smaller positive ozone perturbation per air-
craft emitted NOx-molecule due to the non-linear nature of
the ozone production (e.g. Grooß et al., 1998; Grewe et al.,
1999, 2012). Also worth noting for AIR is the expected in-
crease in O3 impacts in the Southern Hemisphere between
2000 and 2050 A1B with almost a factor of 4 difference in
the zonal mean local maximum near 30◦S for both seasons
