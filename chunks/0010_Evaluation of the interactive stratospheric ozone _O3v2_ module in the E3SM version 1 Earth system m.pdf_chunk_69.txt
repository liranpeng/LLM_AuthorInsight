in judging O3v1 because its ozone hole performance could
possibly be tuned with a better PSC temperature threshold.
Overall, the onset and duration of the ozone hole seem rel-
atively unchanged with different E3SM conÔ¨Ågurations. The
Antarctic stratosphere comes out of wintertime with PSC ac-
tivation of chlorine between 14 and 22 km altitude, and the
Taylor metrics for evolution and decay of the ozone hole are
similar for both (Fig. 3d). We infer that the large-scale dy-
