gas emissions. We further find that Brazil, China and India dominate 
the regional contributions to the increase in global N2O emissions over 
the most recent decade. Our extensive database and modelling capa-
bility fill current gaps in national and regional emissions inventories. 
Future research is needed to further constrain complex biogeochemi-
cal interactions between natural and anthropogenic fluxes and global 
environmental changes, which could lead to considerable feedback in
