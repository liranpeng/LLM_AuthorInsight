Global includes all ATom-1 parcels, Paciﬁc considers all measurements over the Paciﬁc Ocean from 54◦S to 60◦N and Atlantic uses parcels from 54◦S to
60◦N over the Atlantic basin. All parcels are weighted inversely by the number of parcels in each 10◦latitude by 100 hPa bin. Results from the different
MDS versions (0, 1, 2) are shown. UCI2∗uses the revised RDS∗protocol that preprocesses the MDS-2 initializations with a 24 h decay of HNO4 and PAN
