detailed characterization of the structure of both precipitating and non-precipitating clouds 
and the aerosol distributions above, below and around clouds. CSET provided 
unprecedented observations of the evolution of boundary layer structure and cloud and 
aerosol fields that will provide several cases for model evaluation and development. 
Extensive cloud areas were sampled and then resampled 48 hrs later along trajectories
