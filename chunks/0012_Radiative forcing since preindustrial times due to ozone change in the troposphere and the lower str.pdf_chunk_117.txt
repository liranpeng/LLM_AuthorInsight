the observed value of 0.6 K (IPCC, 2003), considering that
the models do not include the likely negative forcing due
to aerosols. Figure 4 shows the annually averaged global-
mean temperature change due to changes in sea surface tem-
peratures and well-mixed greenhouse gases (i.e. “1c minus
1”). Warming is seen in the tropospheric layers, while cool-
ing is conﬁned to the stratosphere.
An exception is the
