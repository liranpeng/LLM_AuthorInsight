20 DU in northern mid-latitudes (WMO, 2003). The global
mean value will be slightly higher due to the relatively strong
ozone depletion in high latitudes. In low latitudes no signiﬁ-
cant stratospheric ozone column reduction has been observed
(WMO, 2003).
Four models have integrated scenario 1a with present cli-
mate and ozone precursors, but with pre-industrial chlorine
and bromine levels. By comparing the differences “2 mi-
nus 1c” and “2 minus 1a”, listed in Table 4, we can esti-
