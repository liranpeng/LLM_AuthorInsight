vertical transport in the tropics and subsequent horizontal
transport of the CO tracer from its major anthropogenic sur-
face sources over East and South Asia as well as biomass
burning sources in equatorial and Central Africa. During
summer, the lower- to mid-tropospheric CO-tracer patterns
are more closely conÔ¨Åned to the source region locations over
East and South Asia and Central Africa (Fig. 5) suggesting
weaker transport around the middle troposphere than in win-
ter.
