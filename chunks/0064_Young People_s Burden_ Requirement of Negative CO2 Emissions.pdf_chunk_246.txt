biases yield +0.4 ± 0.1 W m−2 by Cheng et al. (2017) for
the period 1960–2015 and +0.7 ± 0.1 W m−2 by Dieng et
al. (2017) for the period 2005–2013. We conclude that the
estimate of +0.75 ± 0.25 W m−2 for the current Earth energy
imbalance averaged over the solar cycle is still valid.

CO2 and CH4 growth rates
Growth of airborne CO2 is about half of fossil fuel CO2 emis-
sions (Fig. A8), the remaining portion of emissions being the
net uptake by the ocean and biosphere (Ciais et al., 2013).
