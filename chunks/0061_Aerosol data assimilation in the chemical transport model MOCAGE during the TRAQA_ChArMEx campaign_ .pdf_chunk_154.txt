assimilation could be expected in the case of other strong
aerosol events, like biomass burning or a volcanic ash plume,
where the model emission uncertainties are often even larger
than in the case of desert dust plumes.
By assimilating AOD observations at several wavelengths,
we can get information on aerosol size. If aerosol absorp-
tion can be measured, then we can discriminate between car-
bonaceous and other aerosols. Then, with this information we
