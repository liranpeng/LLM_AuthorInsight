To assess the interannual variability of the signal we com-
pared the transport induced ozone changes to a ten year tran-
sient simulation of E39/C. As can be seen from Fig. 3(bot-
tom) the trafÔ¨Åc induced perturbation signal simulated by
E39/C over the ten years period is on the order of 0.8 DU
and 1.2 DU in January and July, respectively. Largest vari-
ations occur in coastal regions, where synoptic variability
leads to advection of either relatively clean maritime air or
