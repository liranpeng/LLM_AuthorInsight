In the troposphere, Reaction (2d) is important only in the
tropics above 12 km (Prather, 2009). The true P minus L of
O3 includes a large number of other reactions, particularly
involving oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons; but through-
out the remote troposphere (i.e., away from fresh pollution
sources), Reactions (2) minus Reactions (3) accurately ap-
