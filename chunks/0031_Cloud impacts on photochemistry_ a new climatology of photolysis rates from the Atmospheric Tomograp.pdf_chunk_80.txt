overhead clouds (rlnJ < −0.025) as seen in CAFS for 2–12 %
of the measurements.
In the middle troposphere (300–900 hPa, middle panels),
the patterns in clear-sky frequency remain unchanged, but
there is a shift to cloud dimming for 5 to 20 % of the time.
This shift to more cloud obscuration is much greater in CAFS
than in any model. Group 1 models show consistently more
frequent cloud obscuration (10–20 %) than Group 2 models
