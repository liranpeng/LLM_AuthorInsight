ticular interest is the observable aerosol backscatter and ex-
tinction coefﬁcient, which provides, since the arrival of the
CALIOP satellite lidar in the A-train, a constraint for the
global 3-D distribution of aerosols. Therefore modellers are
asked to provide 3-D 6-hourly ﬁelds of aerosol extinction
and backscatter coefﬁcients for one realisation of the DECK
Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) exper-
iment (1979–2014).
