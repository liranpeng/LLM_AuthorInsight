Fig. 5. Annually averaged zonal-mean ozone change (%) between 1850 and 2000 due to climate change only (“1c minus 1”). For UM CAM
“1b minus 1d” is shown since the model did not run simulations “1c” and “1”. The stratosphere (taken as ozone >150 ppbv in year 2000) is
masked for the models that do not calculate stratospheric chemistry explicitly.
