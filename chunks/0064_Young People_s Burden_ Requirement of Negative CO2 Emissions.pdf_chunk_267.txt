other non-CO2 GHGs, especially N2O.
Methane (CH4) is the largest climate forcing other than
CO2 (Fig. 4). The CH4 atmospheric lifetime is only about
10 years (Prather et al., 2012), so there is potential to reduce
this climate forcing rapidly if CH4 sources are reduced. Our
climate simulations, based on the RCP6.0 non-CO2 GHG
scenarios, follow an optimistic path in which CH4 increases
moderately in the next few decades to 1960 ppb in 2070 and
