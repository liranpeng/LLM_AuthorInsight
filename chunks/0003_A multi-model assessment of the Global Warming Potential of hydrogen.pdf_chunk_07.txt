active atmospheric species, such as methane, ozone, and aerosols,
and hence perturbs Earthâ€™s radiative budget. Hydrogen is
involved in atmospheric chemical reactions that affect the lifetime
and abundances of other gases that have an impact on the
climate7 and is thus such an indirect greenhouse gas.
Four main climate impacts are associated with increased hydro-
gen levels: (1) a longer methane (CH4) lifetime and hence increased
methane abundances, (2) an enhanced production of tropospheric
