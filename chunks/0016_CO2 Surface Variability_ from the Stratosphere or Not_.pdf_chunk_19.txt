emissions to test how atmospheric circulation driving a NH–
SH gradient might affect the seasonal and interannual vari-
ability of SH surface CO2. It is obviously not realistic, lack-
ing the large biospheric and oceanic seasonality. A sec-
ond stratospheric-driven sCO2 scenario is forced with a net
stratospheric ﬂux of CO2-depleted air being transported into
the troposphere and down to the surface. This STE ﬂux is cal-
culated as the equivalent of the aging of stratospheric CO2
