(McCulloch et al., 1999), MCF provides the best available
constraint on global OH levels and methane lifetime. The
analysis here uses observations since 1998, when anthro-
pogenic MCF emissions became small compared to atmo-
spheric oxidation of the residual atmospheric burden. Con-
sequently, MCF atmospheric lifetimes can be inferred from
observed decay rates without detailed accounting for emis-
sions and transport (Montzka et al., 2011).
