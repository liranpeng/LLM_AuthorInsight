half of the simulation (t ∈[T/2,T ]) does not resemble typ-
ical observed ﬂow patterns, but it is very convenient for ob-
taining an analytical solution under complex ﬂow conditions.
Partly motivated by that, a series of diagnostics were devel-
oped for which an analytical solution is not needed, and one
can thereby assess accuracy at any point in time. For exam-
ple, before the “unphysical” ﬂow reversal at t = T /2, one
could expect the schemes to be most challenged at least for
