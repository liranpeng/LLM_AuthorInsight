2003 for the North Atlantic and in 2002 and 2003 for Alaska
(Fig. 10b, c). Previous studies attribute peaks in these years
to the presence of large forest Ô¨Åres in western Russia and
Siberia, respectively (Edwards et al., 2004; Yashiro et al.,
2009; van der Werf et al., 2006). MOPITT CO values were
below average in 2016 for both the North Atlantic and Alaska
even though Siberian biomass burning was above average in
2016 (Fig. 9a, b).
Since ENSO is known to drive large biomass burning
