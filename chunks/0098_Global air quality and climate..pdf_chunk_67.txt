conditions (with changes depending on the speciﬁc biogenic
VOC), and (3) the contribution of biogenic VOC nucleation to
the formation of new particles in the atmosphere. Recent
studies estimate that approximately 20–50% of SOA could
result
from
anthropogenic
activity.140–145
Anthropogenic
enhancement of SOA implies an additional aerosol forcing
beyond that reported in the IPCC AR4. Both Hoyle et al.137
and Myhre et al.75 report that increases in the SOA burden
