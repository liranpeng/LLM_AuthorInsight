as a scheme that propagates information (i.e., waves) ﬁrst
in a direction normal to a given cell interface, and then in
a direction transverse to this interface effectively approxi-
mating “swept area” ﬂuxes (see, e.g., Fig. 5.22 in Durran,
2010). CLAW is based on a ﬁrst-order donor cell upwind
method (ﬁrst-order waves) composed of one-dimensional
ﬂux-divergence operators with “correction” terms to take
into account traverse ﬂow of waves and/or higher order
