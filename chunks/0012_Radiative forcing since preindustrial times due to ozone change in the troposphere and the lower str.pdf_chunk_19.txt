Within Integrating Activity 3 of the European Network of
Excellence, ACCENT (“Atmospheric Composition Change:
the European NeTwork of excellence”), a large number of
research groups involved in 3-D atmospheric modeling have
been invited to participate in two comprehensive assessments
of atmospheric composition change. While most of the stud-
ies performed within this effort focus on tropospheric com-
position change to be expected for the near future (year 2030)
