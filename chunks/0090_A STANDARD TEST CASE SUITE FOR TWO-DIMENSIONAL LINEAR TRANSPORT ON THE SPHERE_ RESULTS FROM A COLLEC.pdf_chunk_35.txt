the ﬂux of mass through all cell walls in one time step. This
term is also referred to as the ﬂux divergence. In one dimen-
sion the ﬂux divergence is the difference between the ﬂux
of mass through the left and right wall of the control vol-
ume. Mass conservation is therefore achieved by evaluating
the ﬂux through a cell wall shared by two control volumes
in an identical way. In that case, the amount of mass ﬂow-
ing into a control volume through a cell wall will be exactly
