climate, aiming to identify robust conclusions that may guide
decision-making and to highlight critical knowledge gaps.
Any successful climate mitigation eï¬€ort must address
carbon dioxide (CO2). The relatively short lifetimes of other
radiatively active air pollutants and their precursors (days
to weeks for O3 and aerosols, and approximately a decade
for methane) implies that changes in their atmospheric
abundances could induce rapid climate responses in the next
