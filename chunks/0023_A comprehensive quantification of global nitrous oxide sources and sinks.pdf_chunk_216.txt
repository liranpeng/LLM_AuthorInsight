a, Global anthropogenic N2O emissions; b, Global N2O concentrations. The 
unharmonized emissions from the Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs)104 
show a large variation due to different input data and model assumptions. 
Comparison with Fig. 4b, d illustrates the modifications to the IAM scenario 
data for use in CMIP6. All baseline scenarios (SSP 3−7.0 and SSP 5−8.5; without
