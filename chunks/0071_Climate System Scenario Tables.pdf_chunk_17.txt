table notes. Year 2011 is the last year for observed quantities (denoted 
2011* or 2011obs). Results are shown as global mean values except 
for environmental data focussing on air quality (Tables AII.7.1–AII.7.4), 
which give regional mean surface abundances of O3 and fine particu­
late matter with diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5). Results for global 
mean surface temperature (Tables AII.7.5 and AII.7.6) show only raw 
CMIP5 data or data from previous assessments. For best estimates of
