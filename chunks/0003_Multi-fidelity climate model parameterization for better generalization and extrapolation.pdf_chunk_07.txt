Along with the development of recent climate parameteriza-
tion schemes, various climate simulation data have been made
available. However, most of these were built with simple aqua-
planets2,3,26–29 and those that considered real geography30,31
did not include enough variables for a complete land-surface
coupling. Hence, there is a wealth of relatively low-fidelity
