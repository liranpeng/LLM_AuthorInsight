Rood, 1996). CAM-FV also makes use of a ﬁlling algorithm
to ensure positivity.

CAM-SE
The resolution in CAM-SE is speciﬁed through the number
of elements (NE) in each coordinate direction on one cubed-
sphere panel and the number of quadrature points (NP) in
each coordinate direction of an element. The average resolu-
tion (in degrees) near the Equator is
1λ =
90◦
NE(NP −1).
(A1)
In CAM-SE, NP is set to 4.
The hyperviscosity coefﬁcients are 3.8 × 1016 m4 s−1,
