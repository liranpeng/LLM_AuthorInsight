amounts listed in parentheses (Fig. 10b). The rate of CO2
extraction in all cases increases linearly from zero in 2010
to the value in 2100 that achieves the atmospheric CO2 tar-
get (350 or 450 ppm). The amount of CO2 that must be
extracted from the system exceeds the difference between
the atmospheric amount without extraction and the target
amount (e.g., constant CO2 emissions and no extraction yield
547 ppm for atmospheric CO2 in 2100), but to achieve a tar-
