sults shown here to the ﬁnal calculations with MDS-2 as the
UCI2* model in the 2021 paper. The ﬁrst MDS-0 UCI model
was taken directly from the main CTM code line and devel-
oped for Prather et al. (2017, 2018) by Xin Zhu (not in the
2021 paper). This model was then further adapted and devel-
oped for the 2021 paper and for additional complex sensi-
tivity tests. At this stage (i.e., the UCI2* simulations in the
2021 paper), the results failed several logic tests and were
