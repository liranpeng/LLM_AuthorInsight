SLFV-SL and SLFV-ML employ a multi-dimensional exten-
sion of Van Leer-type slope limiter discussed in Dukowicz
and Kodis (1987).

SLFV scheme description
Since there is currently no publication documenting the
SLFV schemes, a brief description is given here. The
schemes are based on the ﬂux-form continuity Eq. (1) in-
tegrated over a control volume :
A() ∂ρφ
∂t
= −
I
0
ρφV d0.

Here ρφ is the average of ρφ over a control volume  , 0
