ulation exposure, so stations are more readily placed in the
valleys, where the population is greater). The bias could also
reﬂect interpolation errors at the edge of the EMEP domain,
as there are far fewer stations than in AirBase. Differences
between AirBase and EMEP are much smaller in the 50th
and 95th cases, with MBs of −2.7 ± 1.9 and −1.7 ± 2.2 ppb,
respectively. The biases could also be due the cumulative
production of O3 as polluted air disperses since the EMEP
