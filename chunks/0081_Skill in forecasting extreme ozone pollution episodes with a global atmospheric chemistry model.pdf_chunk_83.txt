concurrent sampling, the CTM values are averaged for exact-
day matches for each day and location of the observations
that fall in that percentile bin. In a perfect model, the green
and red curves would match, meaning that the CTM predicts
changes relative to the median at the right time and place.
The blue curve treats the CTM effectively like a climate sim-
ulation and does not try to locate the high-O3 periods over the
correct cells at the correct time. Because the CTM hindcast
