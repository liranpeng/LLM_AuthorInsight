new opportunities to isolate an anthropogenic climate signal
on air quality relative to that from climate variability, which
has not been possible in most published studies to date. Some
of the models also include a well-resolved stratosphere,
enabling assessment of the impact of stratospheric changes,
including ozone depletion and recovery, on tropospheric
ozone and the tropospheric oxidizing capacity. Inclusion of
prognostic aerosolâ€“cloud interactions in these models further
