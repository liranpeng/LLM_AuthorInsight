Tracer and air mass coupling is through super-cycling.

“Swept-area” approach
An alternative and perhaps more physically intuitive ap-
proach to approximating the ﬂux divergence is to trace the
area that is “swept” through an Eulerian cell wall in one
time step – hence the name “swept area” approach, also re-
ferred to as incremental remapping method (Dukowicz and
Baumgardner, 2000), or semi-Lagrangian ﬂux-form ﬁnite-
volume method (Lin and Rood, 1996). These methods are
