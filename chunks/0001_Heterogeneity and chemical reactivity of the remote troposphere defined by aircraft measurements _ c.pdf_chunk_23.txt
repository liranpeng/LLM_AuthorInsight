interact with its neighbors or with externally imposed emis-
sion sources. Effectively the CTM/CCM is initialized and run
for 24 h without transport, scavenging, or emissions. Aerosol
chemistry is also turned off in the A runs. This method al-
lows each parcel to evolve in response to the daily cycle of
photolysis in each model and be assigned a 24 h integrated
reactivity. The instantaneous reaction rates at the time an air
parcel is measured (e.g., near sunset at the end of a ï¬‚ight) do
