sampled water at four different depths (selected based on
chlorophyll concentrations) for N2 ﬁxation and primary pro-
duction rates as well as potential aerobic methane produc-
tion. DNA- and RNA-based sequencing will additionally be
performed on these water samples to identify diazotrophic
community members, potentially including so far unrecog-
nized members. Furthermore, large ﬂoating mats of seaweed
(genus Sargassum) were observed from all crewed platforms.
