to eighth order and thus avoids isotropic-equivalent approx-
imations prevalent in most solar heating codes. The spectral
extension from 0.8 to 12 µm enables calculation of both scat-
tered and absorbed sunlight and thus aerosol direct radiative
effects and heating rates throughout the Earth’s atmosphere.
The Solar-J extension adopts the correlated-k gas ab-
sorption bins, primarily water vapor, from the shortwave
