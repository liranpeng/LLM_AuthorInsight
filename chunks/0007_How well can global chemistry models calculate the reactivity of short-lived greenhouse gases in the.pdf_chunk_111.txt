model–model differences.
Using day-to-day and year-to-year variability in a single
model, we can deﬁne a lower limit to the differences, which
is essentially the noise in this protocol, such that models
are not distinguishably different. For the most part, we ﬁnd
that the GSFC, GC and UCI models fall into this “indistin-
guishable from one another” class because their differences
are within a factor of 2 of the estimated noise level. This
grouping may be explained in part by the common heritage
