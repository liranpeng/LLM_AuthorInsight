explanation is that the interannual variations in the middle
stratospheric consist of both temperature (mapped reason-
ably into O3 variations by Linoz) and chemical variations
(not included in Linoz). This metric is driven by the large in-
terannual MLS variations in the tropical middle stratosphere
(not shown). UCI CTM has a closer match to MLS obser-
vations than either EAM versions both in terms of SD and
correlation. This metric is a difÔ¨Åcult one for the models to
