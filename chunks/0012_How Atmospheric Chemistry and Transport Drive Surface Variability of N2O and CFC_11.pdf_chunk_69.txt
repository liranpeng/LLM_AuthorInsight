The MLS loss, calculated with the offline UCI photochemistry box model, also did not include this direct 
solar cycle effect although it would have included the ozone changes noted above (see P2015). It is possible 
that the anomalous 2013 peak loss in GMI of magnitude 0.6 TgN/yr may be in part a solar cycle signal.
2.5.  Chemistry-Transport Modeling of CFC-11 – Methods
Using only GMI and UCI CTMs, we simulate a synthetic F11X tracer that has the loss frequency of CFCl3
