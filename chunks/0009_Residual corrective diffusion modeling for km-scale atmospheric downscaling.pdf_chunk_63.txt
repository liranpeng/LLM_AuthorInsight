Methods
Consider a specific region on Earth, mapped onto a two-dimensional
grid. Our input \({\bf{y}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{c}
_{{\rm{in}}}\times m\times n}\) is low-resolution meteorological
data taken from a 25 km global reanalysis, or weather forecasting
model (e.g., FourCastNet2,4,5, or the Global Forecast System
(GFS)46). Here, cin represents the number of input channels and
m, n represent the dimensions of a 2D subset of the globe. Our
