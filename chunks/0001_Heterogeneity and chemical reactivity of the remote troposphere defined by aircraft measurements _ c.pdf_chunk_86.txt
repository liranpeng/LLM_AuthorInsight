sults to examine the consistency in calculating the Rs across
models. Thereafter, we rely on the similar results from the
three central models (GC, GMI, and UCI) to justify use of
UCIZ* with MDS-2b as our best estimate for ATom reactiv-
ities. The uncertainty in this estimate can be approximated
by the inter-model spread of the central models as discussed
above. When evaluating the model climatologies for chemi-
cal species, we use MDS-2b. A summary of the key data Ô¨Åles
