model improves upon the deterministic NN. mostly within the
tropics thanks to a better stochasticity representation (figure
4.a). However, the improvement is only noticeable between
the 250 hPa and 750 hPa pressure levels, which are the criti-
cal levels for cloud formation. The LF-RPN model improves
further compared to the SF-HF-RPN model for the tropics
between the 250 hPa and 750 hPa pressure levels, and also
shows higher R2 values for both polar regions, including a very
