The observation operator
The assimilation of AOD in MOCAGE-Valentina requires
the development of an observation operator (H), which trans-
forms the control variable from the model space, i.e. the to-
tal 3-D concentration, into the observation space, i.e. AOD.
The AOD (Ï„) is calculated by taking into account bin number
concentrations (nbin) of all bins (types included) at a certain
model level and the optical properties of individual species
calculated by the Mie code:
Hx =
