of GSFC and GC’s tropospheric chemical model, but UCI’s
chemical mechanism is completely different and much ab-
breviated. All other model pairings show much larger differ-
ences.
All models agree that the more highly reactive parcels
dominate the chemistry; for example, the hottest 10 % of
parcels control 25–30 % of the total reactivities. Unfortu-
nately, they do not agree on which parcels comprise the top
10 %. This diagnostic will become more acute as we move
