(a focus of this study). The models showed a wide range in
the three Rs’ average proﬁles across latitudes over the Pa-
ciﬁc basin, as well as 2D probability densities (PDs) for key
species such as NOx (NO + NO2) versus HOOH. A large
part of the model differences was attributed to the large dif-
ferences found in chemical composition rather than the cal-
culation of rates from that composition. We found that single
transects from a model through the tropical Paciﬁc at differ-
