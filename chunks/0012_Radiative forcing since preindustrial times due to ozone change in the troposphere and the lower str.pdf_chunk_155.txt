(see Fig. 5) and the strong altitude dependence of the LW
forcing. Ozone increase is seen primarily at high altitudes
(middle stratosphere) where the resulting (positive) LW forc-
ing is small, while ozone decrease is modeled at lower alti-
tudes (lower tropical stratosphere), where the resulting (neg-
ative) LW forcing is large. The net effect of these changes is
thus to reduce the net radiative forcing.
