aggregating both datasets to well generalize beyond the train-
ing data. If both models performance are similar, then the
MF-RPN improvement would solely be due to being trained
on the abundant low-fidelity data for a warmer climate and
with a full seasonal cycle. However, if the MF-RPN results
improves upon the LF-RPN ones, then it would justify that
the MF-RPN model is well capable of merging both train-
ing datasets, including the scarce but more physically sound
