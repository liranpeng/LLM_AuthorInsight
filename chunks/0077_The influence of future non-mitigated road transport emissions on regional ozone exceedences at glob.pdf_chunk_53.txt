values for A1B_HIGH of 0.05e0.1 occurring over North Africa and
around Paris and London, which exhibit high population density
and high resident NOx emissions. Comparing absolute differences
between A1B and A1B_HIGH (not shown) reveals that unmitigated
RTE reduces the resident mixing ratios of near-surface O3 around
Paris by w1% as a result of enhanced chemical titration of O3 by the
additional NO released (Kurtenbach et al., 2012). The largest de-
