The most prominent signal of climate change that our analysis captures are the shifts in deep and shallow 
convection across different geographic regions. Figure 6a shows that shallow convection is increasing over 
areas of subsidence, while Fig. 6b shows a corresponding decrease in deep convection over these less active 
oceanic regions. Simultaneously, Fig. 6b depicts an expected increase in the proportion and intensity of deep
