climate over the historical period?
Anthropogenic non-CO2 emissions (e.g. NTCFs, in addition
to other WMGHGs like halocarbons and nitrous oxide) have
led to a climate forcing that is commensurate to the CO2
forcing in some regions, especially over the last few decades
(Myhre et al., 2013a). There are many couplings between dif-
ferent chemically and radiatively active species that remain
to be fully understood. For example, in addition to its direct
