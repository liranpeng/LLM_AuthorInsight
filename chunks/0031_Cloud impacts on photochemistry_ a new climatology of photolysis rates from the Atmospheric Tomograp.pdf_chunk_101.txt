actinic ï¬‚ux includes direct and diffuse light, which depends
on all the neighboring CAs out to tens of kilometers. Adja-
cent clouds can either increase or decrease the scattered sun-
light at the measurement site depending on the location of
the sun.
By including cloud fractional coverage from the meteo-
rological models, and attempting in various ways to describe
cloud overlap, the models here recognize that the atmosphere
is not horizontally homogeneous. Yet, for cost effectiveness
