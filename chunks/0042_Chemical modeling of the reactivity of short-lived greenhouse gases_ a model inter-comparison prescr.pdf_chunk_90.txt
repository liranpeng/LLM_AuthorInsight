the photochemistry starts at local noon. A measurement data
stream, such as from ATom (2017), will include measure-
ments over a range of longitudes and taken with a wide range
of local solar times. We need to ensure that the protocol here
does not depend on when the 24 h integration of reactivity is
initiated. The UCI model selected one day (16 August 2016)
and shifted the local solar time by 12 h, thus initiating each
parcel at local midnight. In addition, the cloud Ô¨Åelds needed
