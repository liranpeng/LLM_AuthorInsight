0.35 Wm−2. For all these models the corresponding increase
in the “2 minus 1c” case was smaller (Table 5), ranging from
0.25 to 0.30 Wm−2, i.e. the change in tropospheric ozone due
to climate change is noticeably reﬂected in the radiative forc-
ing. In case of the DLR E39C model the radiative forcing
increases by the inclusion of climate change, although the
tropospheric ozone burden is reduced. This is due to the fact
that the regions of climate-induced tropospheric ozone in-
