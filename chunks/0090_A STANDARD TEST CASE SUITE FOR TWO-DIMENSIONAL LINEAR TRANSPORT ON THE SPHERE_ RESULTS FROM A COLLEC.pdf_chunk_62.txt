is limited; the theoretical stable CN limitation for linear re-
construction functions is 0.5 (Fig. 3 middle; Lauritzen et al.,
2011a). However, in practice ICON is stable up to CN of
approximately 0.8. The reconstruction polynomial is ﬁrst-
order (linear), and the coefﬁcients are estimated using a con-
servative and weighted least squares reconstruction method
(Ollivier-Gooch and van Altena, 2002). Shape preservation
in ICON-FFSL is obtained by using FCT, and tracer–air-
