additional oceanic emissions of acetone (13 Tg yr−1, Jacob et
al., 2002) and acetaldehyde (57 Tg yr−1, Millet et al., 2010),
which are not included in other models. All emissions except
aviation, biomass burning and lightning occur in the lowest
model layer and are quickly mixed vertically through bound-
ary layer convection and turbulence. Biomass burning is as-
sumed to occur at the surface in the UCI CTM and GEOS-
Chem. In Oslo CTM3, however, biomass burning emissions
