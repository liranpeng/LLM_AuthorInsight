and that T and P are highly correlated in the troposphere,
Cloud-J, and the new Fast-J that sits within it, has de-
vised an alternative method of interpolating the cross sec-
tions for each atmospheric layer: T is the traditional method
used for most species; but P is used for VOCs with highly
pressure-dependent quantum yields. For P interpolation, the
cross sections are averaged over wavelength at three points
along a typical tropospheric lapse rate: 0 km, 295 K, 999 hPa;
