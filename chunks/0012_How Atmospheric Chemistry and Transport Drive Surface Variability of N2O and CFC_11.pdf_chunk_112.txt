anomalous QBO was accompanied by a strong warm phase (El Niño). Studies have shown that El Niño 
events, which suppress tropical upwelling in the Eastern Pacific, lead to a reduction in oceanic N2O emis-
sions; while the opposite is true for La Niña events (e.g., Butler et al., 1989; Cline et al., 1987; Ji et al., 2019). 
Nevison et al. (2007) and Thompson et al. (2019) show that the ENSO index is negatively correlated with
