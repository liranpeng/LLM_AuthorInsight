best model except for the the 137 and 160hPa vertical levels.
Except for the lowest and highest vertical levels, LF-RPN is
outperforming both deterministic NN and SF-HF-RPN models
(figure 2.a). Hence, for these two levels, historical SPCAM5
simulations are closer to those of SPCAM5 +4K run. How-
ever, for any other vertical level except the first one at TOA
and the closest one to sea surface, CAM5 +8K simulation
provides a better approximate of SPCAM5 +4K run dynam-
