tween climate and radiatively active chemical species and/or
aerosols to different degrees of complexity.
A large va-
riety of transport and convection schemes is used, which
are described in detail elsewhere (see references in Ta-
ble 1). All models integrate tropospheric ozone chemistry,
but with varying comprehensiveness, especially with re-
gard to non-methane hydrocarbon chemistry. In the strato-
sphere, four models apply comprehensive chemistry schemes
