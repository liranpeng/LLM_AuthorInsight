determining how CO concentrations in the regions of the
ATom-1 ﬂights compare to previous years. We focus our
analysis of CO interannual variability on several regions tra-
versed by the ATom ﬂights. Figure 8 shows these regions in
black squares overplotted on the MOPITT CO column for
August 2016. We also examine the IAV in BB sources from
nearby regions, outlined in red in Fig. 8. Figure 9 shows
box-and-whisker plots of the mean; minimum; 25th, 50th,
