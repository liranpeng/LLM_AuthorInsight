mates are not broken down by their location (tropospheric
or stratospheric), but whether they are driven by changes in
ozone precursors or ODSs. Models without interactive chem-
istry should only run the aerosol speciÔ¨Åc experiments, and
use the same ozone climatology as piClim-control.
The total simulation years requested are 120 for Tier 1,
120 for Tier 2 and 150 for Tier 3.
