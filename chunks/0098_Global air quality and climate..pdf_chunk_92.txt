tivity to intercontinental sources (mainly due to higher water
vapor).
We synthesize the surface O3 response to climate change as
estimated by various modeling systems in Fig. 3 (blue bars and
symbols). A major caveat is that many studies use present-day
and climate simulations spanning only a few years each due to
computational limitations. While these studies highlight the
responses of air quality to meteorological changes, the simula-
