Conclusions and future work
This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning for skillful and fast climate model emulation.
100x speed-up in run time and 100x greater energy efficiency could democratize the use of climate
models, open new research avenues and potentially reduce energy usage. However, there are
additional steps before this system is a useful climate model [8]. Generalizability is a key challenge.
