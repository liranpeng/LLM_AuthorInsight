during season JJA. For Africa, the worst exceedences shift in line
with the change in the regional biomass burning activity. Mitiga-
tion of emissions from this source is much less realistic than that
from either the industrial or transport sectors due to the impor-
tance for food production. We therefore limit the following dis-
cussion to the impact of A1B_HIGH on the air quality during JJA in
global regions experiencing high regional anthropogenic emissions,
