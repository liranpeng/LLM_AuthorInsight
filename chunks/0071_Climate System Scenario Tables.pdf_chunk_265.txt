using the CMIP5/ACCMIP archive. Due to the very large systematic spread across models, the statistics were calculated for the log values, but Figure 11.23 shows statistics for direct PM2.5 values. 
Owing to the large spatial variations no global average is given. Model mean and standard deviation are shown for year 2000; differences in log10[PM2.5] are shown for 2030, 2050 and 2100. See 
notes for Table AII.7.3 and Figure 11.23 for regions; see also Chapter 11, ES.
