is spherical geometry. With RRTMG-SW, 50 % of the grid
cells are in sunlight and require RT solutions. With Solar-J,
however, important photochemistry and solar heating occur
in the atmosphere when the surface is past sunset (see Fig. 3)
involving about 56 % of the grid cells, a 12 % increase in
radiatively active grid cells. One could expect that RRTMG-
SW will correct this error and end up with similar increases
in coverage and cost.
Most climate models, even at the highest resolutions, have
