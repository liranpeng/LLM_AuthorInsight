With situations of no observations or with sparse ones, data
assimilation is not able to have a major effect.
Following the path of ﬂight B (Fig. 8b) we see again
rather clean aerosol conditions. The modelled and assimi-

shape of the time series curve, but it does not improve the
ﬁeld compared to the measurements noticeably. The result
