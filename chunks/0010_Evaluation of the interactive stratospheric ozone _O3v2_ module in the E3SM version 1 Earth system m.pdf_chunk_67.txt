SCO for O3v1 (Fig. 5a) clearly shows the regular occurrence
of the ozone hole with suitable variability, e.g., the minimal
ozone hole in 2003. The parallel difference plot of O3v2
minus O3v1 (Fig. 5d) shows the O3v1 errors in the lower-
most stratosphere as large wintertime biases of excess ozone
column. In O3v2 there is more interannual variability in the
ozone hole with more frequent occurrence of extreme ozone
values, as shown in years 1995 and 2001. The UCI CTM did
