ative to the J value calculated from the weighted average of all
ICAs using model G6/.33. Values here are calculated using a solar
zenith angle of 13.6â—¦and a surface albedo of 0.10 and averaged over
640 FCAs (108, 125 ICAs) derived from the equatorial statistics (all
longitudes) of cloud fraction, liquid water content, and ice water
content from a snapshot of a T319L60 meteorology from the Eu-
ropean Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts. Three simple
