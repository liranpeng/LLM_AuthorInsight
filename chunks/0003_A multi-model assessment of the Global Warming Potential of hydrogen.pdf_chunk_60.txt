and air pollution by switching to a hydrogen economy.
By using an ensemble of models with detailed forcing calcu-
lations, taking all effects into account including the stratosphere,
we have found that the GWP100 of hydrogen is twice as high as
earlier estimates, and comparable to recent estimates13,16. Our
estimated GWP100 of hydrogen is 39% of that to fossil fuel
methane GWP100 in AR633. This emission metric can be used in
various mitigation policy decisions, by comparing different GHG
