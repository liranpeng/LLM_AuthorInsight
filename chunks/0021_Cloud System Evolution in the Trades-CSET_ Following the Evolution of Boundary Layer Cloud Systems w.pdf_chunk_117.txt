cloudiness transition observed in the CSET study area. The CSET observations provide a 
unique data set for studying the heavy precipitation events observed in these clouds and the 
aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions involved in these mesoscale complexes.
The mesoscale systems sampled are also rich in different types of aerosol cloud interactions. 
A feature that was frequently observed during CSET was optically thin veil clouds that were
