(black solid line), and for the models we present two different
13-year periods to address the uncertainty in calculating SD
from such a short record. EAM versions use the years 1995–
2007 (dashed) and 2002–2014 (solid), while UCI CTM uses
the speciﬁc years 1992–2004 (dashed line) and 2005–2017
(solid). All model results reproduce the general pattern in
observations: peak variability (∼7 DU) in the core tropics, a
minimum (3 DU) at 15◦latitude, and then steadily increasing
