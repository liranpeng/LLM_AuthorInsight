was prescribed at ≈2. Tg[N]/year. Biogenic sources were
calculated with the vegetation model ORCHIDEE. Oceanic
emissions were taken from Folberth et al. (2005).

OsloCTM2
The Oslo CTM2 model is a 3-D chemical transport model
driven by ECMWF meteorological data and extending from
the ground to 10 hPa in 40 vertical layers. The horizontal
resolution for this study was Gaussian T42 (2.8◦×2.8◦). The
model was spun up for several years with emissions from
