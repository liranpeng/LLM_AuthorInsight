global non-CO2 GHG emissions. The dramatic growth in the
baseline can be reduced as shown in a hypothetical accelerated
CFA reduction policy. Worldwide adoption of Euro 6/VI for on-
road vehicles could avoid the near-term climate impacts of 800
million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) by 2030. The long-
term impacts avoided would be equivalent to the damage done by
220 MtCO2e. Facanha et al. (2012) estimate that, by 2030, the
tank-to-wheels (TTW) emission reductions from pipeline poli-
