its global radiative forcing.
In the past, several calcula-
tions of radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone increase
since the preindustrial era have been published (e.g. Kiehl et
al., 1999; Berntsen et al., 2000; Hauglustaine and Brasseur,
2001; Mickley et al., 2001). Chapter 6 of the IPCC Third
Assessment Report (IPCC-TAR) (Ramaswamy et al., 2001)
reports a radiative forcing of 0.35±0.15 Wm−2 for the period
1750 to 1998, ranking ozone as a climate forcing gas in third
