tant source of atmospheric heating. Likewise, Rayleigh scattering in the visible plays a minor role in photol-
ysis rates but is an important source of reflected sunlight. A first-order estimate based simply on weighting 
tropospheric extinction with solar flux has Rayleigh scatter (forward and back) of 123 W m−2, O3 absorption 
of 2.7 W m−2, and surface reflection (ocean albedo = 0.05) of 36 W m−2. This should be a relatively easy 
wavelength region to model accurately.
