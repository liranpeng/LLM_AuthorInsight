China and the ME/Turkey, where resident mixing ratios are w100%
higher than those during boreal wintertime. For West Africa, a
minimum occurs during the boreal summertime in stark contrast to
the other regions, due to seasonal biomass burning.
The mitigation of anthropogenic NOx emissions in Western
Europe and the Eastern US results in two seasonal features: (i) an
increase in near-surface O3 during boreal wintertime of w10 ppb
(Ã¾30%) and (ii) a decrease in peak near-surface O3 during boreal
