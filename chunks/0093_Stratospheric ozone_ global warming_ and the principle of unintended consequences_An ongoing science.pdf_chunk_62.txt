the fuel (Hesterberg et al., 2011).
Figure 1 shows the effect of controlling BC emissions from
on-road vehicles by attaining Euro 6/VI emission limits, which
require the use of DPFs and NOx controls (Weiss et al., 2012).
The Euro6/VI modeling scenarios in Figure 1 show a baseline
that reflects current regulations and what can be done if state-of-
the-art technologies are applied. Fuel use in the developing
countries of China and India will have important effects on
