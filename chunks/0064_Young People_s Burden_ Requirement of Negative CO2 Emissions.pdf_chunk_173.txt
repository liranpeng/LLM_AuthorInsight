lower limit on our estimate, we do not speculate further about
potential cost reduction.
In contrast, continued high emissions, between constant
emissions and +2 % yr−1, would require additional extrac-
tion of 595–1530 PgC (Fig. 10b) at a cost of USD 89–
535 trillion or 1.1–6.7 trillion per year over 80 years.13 Such
extraordinary cost, along with the land area, fertilizer and wa-
ter requirements (Smith et al., 2016) suggest that, rather than
