for a day in mid-August using their standard treatment of
clouds (designated all sky or cloudy here) and then a par-
allel simulation with clouds and aerosols removed (desig-
nated clear sky or clear). In addition to its correlated cloud-
overlap model with multiple quadrature column atmospheres
to calculate an average J value, UCI also contributed a
model version using the B-averaging of cloud fractions (CFs)
(Briegleb, 1992) used by most models, designated UCIb (see
