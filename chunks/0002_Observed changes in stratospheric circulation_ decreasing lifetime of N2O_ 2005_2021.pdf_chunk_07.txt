that N2O increases through the middle tropical stratosphere,
relatively greater than the rate of tropospheric increases, lead
to a shorter atmospheric lifetime, an important consequence
of a more vigorous BDC.
Consequences of an enhanced BDC have recently fo-
cussed on the increased ï¬‚ux of stratospheric ozone (O3) into
the troposphere with a subsequent increase in tropospheric
O3; see the discussion in Karpechko et al. (2018) and Gar-
ney et al. (2022). Enhanced BDC also leads to shorter life-
