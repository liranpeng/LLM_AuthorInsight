sponse to future increases in greenhouse gases in the 2090s
under the RCP 8.5 scenario, changes in mixing ratios of
a CO-like tracer with a 50-day lifetime exhibit robust fea-
tures across four chemistry–climate models participating in
the ACCMIP model intercomparison. These include a de-
crease in CO-tracer mixing ratios throughout most of the tro-
posphere, especially in the tropics (5–10 %), and an increase
in CO-tracer mixing ratios near the tropopause (10–25 %),
