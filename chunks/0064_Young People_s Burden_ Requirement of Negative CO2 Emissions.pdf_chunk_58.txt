conditions in assessments with improved synchronization of
records (Govin et al., 2015) – and that they also suggest that
a possible seasonal bias of proxy temperature could make the
total overestimate as large as 1.1 ± 0.4 ◦C. Given uncertain-
ties in the corrections, it becomes a matter of expert judg-
ment. Dutton et al. (2015) conclude that the best estimate for
Eemian temperature is +1 ◦C relative to preindustrial. Con-
sistent with these estimates and the discussion of Masson-
