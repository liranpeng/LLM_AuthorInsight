parameterization outputs at different fidelity levels (low to
high-fidelity, blue network in figure 1.b). The proposed ar-
chitecture directly learns the non-linear mapping between the
low-to-high fidelity outputs instead of inferring the difference
between them as an error bias correction37,38,70,71. The bias
correction approach was only shown to improve coarse-grid
climate models using higher resolution simulations and not
vice versa despite the abundant low-fidelity data. In addi-
