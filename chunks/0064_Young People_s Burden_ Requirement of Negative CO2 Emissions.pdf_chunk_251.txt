2013). Recent box-model inversions of the CH4–CH3CCl3
system have argued for large ﬂuctuations in the atmospheric
sink over this period but there is no identiﬁed cause for such
changes (Rigby et al., 2017; Turner et al., 2017; Prather and
Holmes, 2017). Future changes in the sink could lead to in-
creased atmospheric CH4 separate from emission changes,
but this effect is difﬁcult to project and not included in the
RCP scenarios (Voulgarakis et al., 2013).
