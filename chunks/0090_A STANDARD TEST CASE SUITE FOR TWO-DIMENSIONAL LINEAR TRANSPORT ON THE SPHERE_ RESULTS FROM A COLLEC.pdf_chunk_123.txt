liberately been chosen to include a range [f
1λ,3◦], where
f
1λ > 0.1◦. With the 3◦grid spacing, the mixing ratio dis-
tributions may be marginally resolved. The main interest
is not asymptotic convergence rates, which should be close
to the theoretical convergence rate, but rather the effect of
marginally resolved features in the convergence rate compu-
tations.
Convergence plots for ℓi, i = 2,∞, for the unlimited and
shape-preserving versions of the schemes are given in Figs. 1
