values between 1.0 and 2.0. The global L-CH4 – 0.50 to
0.65 ppb day−1 – is similar for all models, with D in the mid-
dle. So globally, models B and D are similar, but, in the mid-
Paciﬁc, they are distinct with model D having much lower
L-CH4 values in the tropics and especially the lower tropics
(Fig. 3, see also Fig. S1 of Naik et al., 2013b). CH4 loss is a
major source of HCHO in the unpolluted atmosphere and this
may partly explain D’s lower values of tropical HCHO com-
