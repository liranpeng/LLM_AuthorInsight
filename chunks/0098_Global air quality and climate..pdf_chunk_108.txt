probability of wildÔ¨Åres, a source of pollutant emissions,
increases with temperature (Table 1).
Although the record lengths of surface O3 and PM observa-
tions are increasing and allow for new analyses on connections
between extreme pollution events and meteorological condi-
tions, additional work is needed to determine their relevance
to the response to changing climate. For example, over the
Northeastern United States, Leibensperger et al.195 report a
