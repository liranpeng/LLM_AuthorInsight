landâ€”is critical for accurately simulating soil N2O emissions. Third, 
national and global N2O flux measurement networks17 could be used 
to validate model performance and to constrain large-scale model 
simulations. Data assimilation techniques could be used to improve 
model accuracy.
Current remaining uncertainty in global ocean model estimates of 
N2O emission includes the contribution of N2O flux derived from the 
tropical oceanic low oxygen zones (for example, the eastern Equatorial
