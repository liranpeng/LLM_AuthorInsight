m−2. When we mix 2-stream versus 8-stream (RRTMG vs. SJ/Mie, red line in Figure S1), the profile errors 
are large and oscillate. While the column mean difference is small in this case, the rms difference is as large 
as the worst case δ-0. In high solar latitudes (50°S–70°S and 30°N–50°N in January) where SZA remains 
large at all hours, the monthly mean averages have consistent errors of 1–2 W m−2 at the surface (Figure 1c).
