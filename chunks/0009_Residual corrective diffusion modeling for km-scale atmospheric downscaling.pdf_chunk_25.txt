the hot and cold tails of the CorrDiff-generated surface temperature
distribution are only incrementally improved relative to the UNet
(Fig.Â 1e) and the overall windspeed PDF is virtually unchanged
relative to the UNet, despite the scale-selective variance
enhancements noted previously. Overall, CorrDiff produces
encouraging probability distributions, with the caveat that apparent
agreement of generated tail structures should be viewed as
