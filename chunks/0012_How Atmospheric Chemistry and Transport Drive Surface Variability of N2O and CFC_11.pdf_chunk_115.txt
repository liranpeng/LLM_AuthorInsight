amplitude of this signal is different across the models (Figure 3), we rescale the models' surface variability 
to match the root-mean-square deviation from the mean of the observed QBO signal (Figure 3) before 
calculating the residuals. The NOAA-minus-model residuals are then correlated with the Niño 3.4 index
