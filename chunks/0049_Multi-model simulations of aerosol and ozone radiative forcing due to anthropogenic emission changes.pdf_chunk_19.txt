thropogenic emission data from ECLIPSE for the 1990 to
2015 period (Klimont et al., 2016; Stohl et al., 2015). Several
updates and improvements compared to earlier emission data
sets were included in this inventory (Klimont et al., 2016).
The ECLIPSE emission data are shown in Fig. 1 over the pe-
riod 1990â€“2015 and are compared to emission data used in
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)
and to be used in CMIP6. Figure S1 in the Supplement
