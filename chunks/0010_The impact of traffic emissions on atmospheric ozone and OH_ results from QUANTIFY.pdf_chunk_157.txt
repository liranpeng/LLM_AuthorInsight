methane lifetime is about 0.2% for ship trafﬁc, which is more
than twice the value of road and aviation (0.9% and 0.5%, re-
spectively).
Road emissions in the northern hemisphere affect ozone in
particular during summer, when the low solar zenith angles
in the extratropics enhance photochemistry. Continental con-
vection leads to vertical redistribution of the road emissions
resulting in a signiﬁcant contribution to the ozone perturba-
