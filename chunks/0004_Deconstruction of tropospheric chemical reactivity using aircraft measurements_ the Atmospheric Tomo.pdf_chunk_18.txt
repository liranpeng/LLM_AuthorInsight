about the dateline), eastern Paciﬁc (0–30◦N, ∼121◦W, the
ﬁrst ﬂight of each deployment to and from Palmdale), and
tropical Atlantic (30◦S–30◦N). The Southern Ocean (66–
55◦S, the Christchurch to Punta Arenas ﬂight) and two polar
regions (Arctic, > 66◦N; Antarctic, < 66◦S) are also exam-
ined separately. Only over-ocean data are analyzed here, ex-
cept for the two polar regions.
