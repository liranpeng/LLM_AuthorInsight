the climate responses to the particular mix of pollutant plus
greenhouse gas sources from individual anthropogenic emis-
sion sectors (Section 2.3) is particularly relevant for policy
decisions targeting controls on speciﬁc human activities.
We brieﬂy highlight the potential for emissions from the
terrestrial biosphere to respond to changing pollution levels
and climate, and thereby further change air quality (Section 2.4).
Biospheric feedbacks to climate have been addressed recently.24
