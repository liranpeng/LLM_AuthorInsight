The
spectral
bicubic
interpolation
scheme
(SBC,
Enomoto, 2008) is a traditional semi-Lagrangian grid-point
scheme in Eq. (10) based on spectral transforms on a
latitude–longitude Gaussian grid (Ritchie, 1987). The zonal,
meridional, and cross derivatives are calculated using the
spectral transform method and are then fed into the bicubic
interpolation formula providing a fully two-dimensional
