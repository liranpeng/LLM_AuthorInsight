and Kirchstetter et al. (2004). We also take into account the
hygroscopicity of sea salt aerosols.
The tangent-linear operator (H = ∂H
∂xi ) is a linearized ver-
sion of the non-linear observation operator H around the sys-
tem state x, and it consists of partial derivatives of H with
respect to all input variables. It gives a ﬁrst-order approxi-
mation (δτ) of the difference between the unperturbed (Hx)
and the perturbed results (H(x + 1x)) of the non-linear op-
erator H.
