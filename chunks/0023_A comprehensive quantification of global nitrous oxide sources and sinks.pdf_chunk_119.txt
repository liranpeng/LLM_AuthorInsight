and regional reservoirs in the 2000s, and averaged their estimates 
with those from ref. 35 to represent emissions from reservoirs during 
1980â€“2016. The estimate for global and regional estuaries and lakes 
is still based on the long-term averaged values provided by ref. 35 and 
ref. 51, respectively. We considered the riverine emissions in the year 
1900 as equivalent to the natural emission for the DLEM estimate assum-
ing that the nitrogen load from land was negligible in that period52. We
