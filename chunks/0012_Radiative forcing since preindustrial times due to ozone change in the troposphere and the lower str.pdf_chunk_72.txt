Wong et al., 2004). CH4 and N2O were set to values of
791.6 ppbv and 273.8 ppbv, respectively, while CO2 levels
were chosen by the modelers (see Table 2). In all models that
include chlorine and bromine chemistry, tropospheric mixing
ratios of CFCs, HCFCs, and halons were taken from WMO
(2003) for the 2000 simulations and set to zero in the prein-
dustrial runs. CH3Cl and CH3Br were set to 550 and 6 pptv,
respectively, in both the 2000 and 1850 simulations. An ex-
