and surface imprint (Chelton et al., 2001), the sparsity of di-
rect observations limits our ability to test understanding of
such structures, in particular subsurface eddies. Understand-
ing of the role of these types of structures is further limited by
their short lifespans (hours to days) and small spatial scales
(0.1 to 10 km), which make them difÔ¨Åcult to observe. These
facts motivated ocean observations during EUREC4A, as did
recent work suggesting that such coherent structures, in par-
