design schemes that solve the continuity equation, also re-
ferred to as transport schemes or advection schemes. Numer-
ous new algorithms have been developed within the last 10 yr
or so. These encompass ﬁnite-volume, ﬁnite-difference, and
Galerkin-based methods.
Despite the growing amount of research in transport
scheme algorithms, the “mandatory” idealized testing of
such algorithms on the sphere is surprisingly little stan-
dardized. In fact, the only standardized test in global trans-
