CN for schemes implemented on non-isotropic grids. Again
the reader is referred to the scheme-speciﬁc Appendix to ﬁnd
time steps 1t corresponding to speciﬁc CNs at any of the
three resolutions. Data used to make histograms are avail-

consists of two analytical ﬂow ﬁelds (one non-divergent and
one divergent) designed to deform initially well-resolved ini-
tial conditions into thin ﬁlaments half way through the sim-
