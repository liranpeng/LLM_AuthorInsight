Acetylene and ethane have atmospheric lifetimes comparable to or shorter than the characteristic transport
times from their major sources to the polar regions. Consequently, transport and removal must be consid-
ered in order to estimate the variations in emissions responsible for atmospheric histories derived from ice
core data. The UCI‐CTM was used to estimate the sensitivity (deﬁned as pmol mol−1 per Tg year−1 emission)
