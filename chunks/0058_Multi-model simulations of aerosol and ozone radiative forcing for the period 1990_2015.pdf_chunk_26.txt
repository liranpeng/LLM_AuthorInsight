aerosols (SOA) and nitrate. Five of the models simulated
ozone changes over the period. The same ofï¬‚ine radia-
tive transfer code used for calculating the radiative forcing
for OsloCTM2 was adopted for the atmospheric abundance
changes from the EMEP model.
Differences in atmospheric abundances can be large due
to different meteorological data sets (up to more than 50 %
in global mean aerosol burden) (Liu et al., 2007), and sur-
