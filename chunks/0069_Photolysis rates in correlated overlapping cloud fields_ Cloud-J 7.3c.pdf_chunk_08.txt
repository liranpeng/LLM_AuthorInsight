imally overlapped groups (MAX) that were randomly over-
lapped relative to one another (MAX-RAN) (Briegleb, 1992;
Feng et al., 2004). A more accurate description of cloud over-
lap is that clouds are highly correlated (i.e., maximally over-
lapped) when they are vertically near each other, but they
become randomly overlapped when separated by greater dis-
tances. The cloud decorrelation length is the vertical distance
over which the overlap e-folds to random. From a range of
