of other sources of IAV. Given the recent success in demonstrating that the stratospheric inﬂux of N2O- and
chloroﬂuorocarbon-depleted air is a dominant source of their surface IAV in the Southern Hemisphere, I apply
the same model and measurement analysis here to CO2. Using chemistry-transport modeling or scaling of the
observed N2O variability, I ﬁnd that the stratosphere-driven surface variability in CO2 is at most 10 % of the
