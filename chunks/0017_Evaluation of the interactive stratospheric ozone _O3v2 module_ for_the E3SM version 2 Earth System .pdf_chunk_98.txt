change is much smaller than changes driven by altering the
horizonal resolution or physical parameters. This result sug-
gests that the high E3SMv1 climate sensitivity (deﬁned as be-
ing proportional to the inverse of λ) is not related to the O3v1
deﬁciencies. Similar to Nowack et al. (2015), our O3v2 sim-
ulations also show ozone decrease around the tropopause and
