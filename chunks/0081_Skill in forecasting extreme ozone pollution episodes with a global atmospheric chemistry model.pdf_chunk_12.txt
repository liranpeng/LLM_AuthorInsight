prevents ready quantitative assessment of model errors. If
station observations are used to generate an observed ozone
product that is directly comparable to what a model predicts,
viz. the average O3 concentration in a grid cell, then geo-
graphic patterns and statistics of the pollution episodes can
be readily and commensurably tested. In Sect. 2, we present
our new algorithm for mapping the individual station data
onto cell averages on a regular grid. As part of this analysis
