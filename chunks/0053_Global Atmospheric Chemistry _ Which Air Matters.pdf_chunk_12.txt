linear – viz. the chemistry integrated over a mix of parcels
is not necessarily the same as that over the average of the
mix (e.g., Chatﬁeld and Delaney, 1990). We have progressed
in modeling atmospheric chemistry over the past 4 decades
from a few boxes (e.g., stratosphere and troposphere, north-
ern and southern hemispheres) to high-resolution gridded
models with many millions of cells. These models simulate
myriads of air parcels that at times represent the observed
