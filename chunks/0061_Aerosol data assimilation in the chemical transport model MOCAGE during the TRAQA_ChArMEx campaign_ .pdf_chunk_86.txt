Figure 4. Scatter plots of aerosol optical depths (where colours
represent the number of points) from the independent observation
dataset (SEVIRI) and the simulations: the direct model run (a) and
the assimilation model run (b). In each panel, correlation (ρ), ab-
solute bias (1), root mean square error (RMSE) and standard devi-
ation (σ) are noted. The included data correspond to the period of
