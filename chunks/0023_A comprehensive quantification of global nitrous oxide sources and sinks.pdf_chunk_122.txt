results from the reaction of NH2 with NO2 (refs. 55,56), N with NO2, and 
from the oxidation of N2 by O(1D)57, all of which constitute an estimated 
source of 0.3 (0.2–1.1) Tg N yr−1. The estimate of the ‘Surface sink’ was 
obtained from ref. 58 and ref. 59.
The anthropogenic sources include four sub-sectors:
(a) Agriculture. This consists of four components: ‘Direct soil emis-
sions’, ‘Manure left on pasture’, ‘Manure management’ and ‘Aquacul-
