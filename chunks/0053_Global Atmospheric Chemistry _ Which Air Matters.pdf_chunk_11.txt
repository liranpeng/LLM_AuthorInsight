the consequences of many atmospheric pollutants as regards
global air quality and climate.
We have a tendency to simplify this heterogeneity as
global, hemispheric, or even regional averages that can be
represented with an average chemical composition. This
holds true especially when diagnosing the sources and sinks
of critical pollutants or when comparing models with at-
mospheric measurements. Yet, chemistry inherently involves
quadratic reactions of two or more species and hence is non-
