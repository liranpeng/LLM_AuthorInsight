to be rearranged so that the pairing of clouds and solar zenith
angles were the same in both cases. The start-at-midnight
version has larger reactivities by at most 1 % with no changes
in the J-values as expected for the protocol (e.g., keeping the
morning clouds in the morning for both calculations). The
rms differences between the two cases are 2â€“10 times less
than the year-to-year differences. We conclude that the initia-
tion time produces discernible differences but not at the level
