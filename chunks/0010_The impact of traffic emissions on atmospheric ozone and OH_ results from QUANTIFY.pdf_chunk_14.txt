12% in northern midlatitudes during July. Similar values of
10% are reported by Niemeier et al. (2006) for current con-

Besides the effects of pollutants on ozone a potential
change of the OH concentration is of importance in partic-
ular for regional air quality and the self-cleaning capacity of
the atmosphere (Lelieveld et al., 2002). Changes of methane
loss rates due to anthropogenic emissions are reported to be
on the order of 0.5%/yr of which 1/3 (0.16%) is due to an in-
