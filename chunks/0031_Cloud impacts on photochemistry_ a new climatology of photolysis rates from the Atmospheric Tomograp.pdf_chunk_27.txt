the two oceanic blocks in the Paciﬁc for which we have a
large number of measurements with high sun in ATom-1. See
also discussion of ocean surface albedo variations in Sect. 4.
The CAFS statistics are derived from the ATom-1 deploy-
ment and selected for two remote geographic blocks in or-
der to compare with the models: (block 1) tropical Paciﬁc,
20◦S–20◦N × 160–240◦E, and (block 2) North Paciﬁc, 20–
50◦N × 170–225◦E.
The models here include the six original ones used in the
