statistics of the means and extremes, altitude mean proÔ¨Åles,
and probability densities. In Sect. 4, we analyze the sensi-
tivities of the reactivities to each of the observed species
for ATom-1. These sensitivities identify those critical species
where a model bias will introduce large errors into the O3 and
CH4 budgets. In Sect. 5, we examine the impacts of MDS-3
on these analyses, and we introduce probability densities for
some critical species as a possible model metric. In Sect. 6,
