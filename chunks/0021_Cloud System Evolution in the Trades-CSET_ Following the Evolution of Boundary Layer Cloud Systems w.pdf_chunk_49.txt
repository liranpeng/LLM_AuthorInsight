and their associated precipitation structures. The first three Doppler spectra moments 
(reflectivity, mean Doppler velocity and spectral width) calculated using the pulse-pair 
technique were displayed in real-time on the aircraft and recorded and archived for 
processing. In addition, the raw data that give phase and amplitude from the inphase (I) and 
quadrature-phase (Q) signals for each pulse were recorded and archived for each flight.
