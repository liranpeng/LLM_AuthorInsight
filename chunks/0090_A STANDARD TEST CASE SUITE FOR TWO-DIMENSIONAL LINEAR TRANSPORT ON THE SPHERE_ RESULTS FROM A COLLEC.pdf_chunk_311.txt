Slope limiting
In general this gradient construction will not lead to a
positivity-preserving scheme. For this we use a multidimen-
sional extension of Van Leer-type slope limiter (Dukowicz
and Kodis, 1987). In Eqs. (A15)–(A16) we replace the gra-
dient ∇φ by a modiﬁed gradient ˜∇kφ = αk∇kφ. The limiting
coefﬁcient αk is determined for each cell k such as to enforce
local monotonicity. Dukowicz and Kodis (1987) show that a
possible choice of αk is
αk = min(1,αmin
