enhance the methane GWP value.
Fig. 4 The GWP100 of hydrogen. Hydrogen GWP100 for the individual models (a) and model mean (b), split into contributions from methane (green),
ozone (yellow), and stratospheric water vapor (purple). The UKCA model only includes tropospheric changes. The uncertainty range in (b) is calculated
using the model mean and spread in underlying values found in literature and the model ensemble spread. Details on the calculation can be found in
Methods.
