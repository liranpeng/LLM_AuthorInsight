The Future of Mobile Air Conditioner
(MAC) Refrigerants
The critical review raises the issue of unintended conse-
quences of various cooling methods and refrigerants. Use of
ice from contaminated waterways led to the development of
manufactured ice using toxic refrigerants. Toxic refrigerants
were then replaced by nontoxic CFC compounds. CFCs, speci-
fically CFC-12, used in mobile air conditioners (MACs) became
