climate simulations. Linoz v2 calculates the Ô¨Årst-order Tay-
lor expansion terms for the stratospheric ozone production
and loss based on local temperature, local ozone abundance,
and the overhead ozone column and is tabulated for differ-
ent levels of ozone-depleting substances. Linoz has been ap-
plied in various chemistry transport models (CTMs), includ-
ing the University of California, Irvine (UCI) CTM, and pro-
