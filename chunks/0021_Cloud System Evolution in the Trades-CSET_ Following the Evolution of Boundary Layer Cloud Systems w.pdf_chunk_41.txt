precipitation, and turbulence properties. The instrumentation is listed in Table 1 and 
described in detail on the EOL website (http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/instruments/doc/). The 
GV was well-instrumented for making in situ characterizations of the mean and turbulent 
wind and thermodynamic structures below, in and above the cloud layer. Further, aerosol, 
cloud and precipitation observations were made from the G-V using several probes. The GV
