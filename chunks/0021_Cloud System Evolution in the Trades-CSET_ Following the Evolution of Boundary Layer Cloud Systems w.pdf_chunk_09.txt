1) Introduction and Motivation
Boundary-layer clouds in the form of stratocumulus and small marine cumulus are the most 
frequently observed cloud types over the Earth’s oceans, are the most abundant types 
globally (Norris, 1998) and have an important impact on the Earth’s radiation budget 
(Hartmann and Short 1980). The energy and moisture fluxes associated with these clouds are 
critical in maintaining the thermodynamic structure of the lower troposphere. Thus, both the
