random ICAs (18 times greater cost) are needed to achieve
the accuracy of cloud quadrature.
From the point of view of chemistryâ€“climate models, large
rms errors in Js cannot be tolerated because the chemistry is
non-linear and such errors are not likely to average. In cli-
mate models, there are threshold processes like aerosol and
ozone heating preventing cloud formation (e.g., Koch and
DelGenio, 2010), for which heating noise may not simply av-
