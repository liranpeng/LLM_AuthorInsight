sity, seasonal cycles) that can be used as metrics to test global
chemistry climate models’ (GCCMs) future climate simula-
tions.
The size of the largest AQX episodes (deﬁning an episode
as connected events as in Fig. 10) is driven by a com-
bination of meteorology as well as regionally connected
emissions and active photochemistry. To objectively identify
these episodes we use an agglomerative hierarchal cluster
analysis. Ideally, the clustering algorithm will connect AQX
