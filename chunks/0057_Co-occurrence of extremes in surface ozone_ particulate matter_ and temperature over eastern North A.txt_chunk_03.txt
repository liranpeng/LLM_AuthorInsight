change, making it imperative to understand the nature of their co-occurrence. In this paper, using 15 years of surface observations over the eastern United States and Canada, we show that the extremes cluster together in often overlapping large-scale episodes, and that the largest episodes have the hottest temperatures and highest levels of pollution. Heat waves and air pollution episodes pose a serious threat to human health and may worsen under future climate change. In this paper, we use 15
