determine the positions of the droplets within that volume. Post-flight analyses of the 
holograms recorded at 3.3 Hz produce size distributions for all samples in cloud and 
precipitation areas sampled during CSET by HOLODEC (Glienke et al, 2017).
Ozone and carbon monoxide measurements were made using the Fast Response Ozone 
(F03_AD) and the Carbon Monoxide (Aero-Laser VUV) instruments supported by the 
Community Airborne Research Instrumentation (CARI) group in Atmospheric Chemistry
