flight the boundary layer concentrations are reduced to about 410 cm−3 and the above 
inversion concentrations are about 70 cm−3. But while the boundary layer values are 
measured in the same air mass, there is no guarantee that the air above the inversion will 
follow the same trajectory. Regardless, the CSET trajectory analyses are a rich source of 
information for studying the evolution of aerosols and cloud and precipitation properties in 
the transition process.
