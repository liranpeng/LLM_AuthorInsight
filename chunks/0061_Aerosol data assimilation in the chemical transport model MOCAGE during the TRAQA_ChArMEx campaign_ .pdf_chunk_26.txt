are desert dust, sea salt, black carbon (BC) and organic car-
bon (OC). The particle size distribution for each type is di-
vided into six size bins, characterized by the particle aver-
age diameter and mass. The size ranges of bins for all con-
sidered aerosol species are shown in Table 1. Each aerosol
bin is then treated as a passive tracer: aerosols are emit-
ted, transported and removed from the atmosphere; however
there are no transformations or chemical reactions between
