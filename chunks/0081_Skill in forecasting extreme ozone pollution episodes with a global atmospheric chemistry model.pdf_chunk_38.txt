weights of these sites are often already signiﬁcantly reduced
by the declustering scheme.
We optimize the interpolation parameters using the leave-
k-out cross-validation scheme (Cressie, 1993). This involves
removing k = 10 % of observation sites and predicting their
values using the remaining observations and IDW interpo-
lation deﬁned above, recording the root mean square error
(RMSE) of the predicted sites. This is done for 365 randomly
