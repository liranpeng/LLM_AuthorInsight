follow the RETRO vertical distribution (Schultz et al., 2008),
which injects 35 % of equatorial emissions and 45 % of bo-
real emissions above the boundary layer. In a sensitivity test
we inject all biomass burning into the lowest model layer in
Oslo CTM3.
Lightning NOx emissions are calculated with similar
methods in all 3 CTMs, with UCI CTM and Oslo CTM3 us-
ing identical algorithms. In all models, these emissions are
derived from cloud-top heights in the underlying meteorol-
