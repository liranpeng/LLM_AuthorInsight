both solar heating and photochemistry in Earth system mod-
els. Solar-J is a spectral extension of Cloud-J, a standard in
many chemical models that calculates photolysis rates in the
0.18–0.8 µm region. The Cloud-J core consists of an eight-
stream scattering, plane-parallel radiative transfer solver with
corrections for sphericity. Cloud-J uses cloud quadrature to
accurately average over correlated cloud layers. It uses the
scattering phase function of aerosols and clouds expanded
