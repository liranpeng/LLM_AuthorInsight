commonly at power plants, with capture and sequestration of
resulting CO2 (Creutzig et al., 2015), and (2) direct air cap-
ture of CO2 and sequestration (Keith, 2009; NAS, 2015a),
and (3) grinding and spreading of minerals such as olivine
to enhance geological weathering (Taylor et al., 2016). How-
ever, energy, land and water requirements of these technolo-
gies impose economic and biophysical limits on CO2 extrac-
tion (Smith et al., 2016).
