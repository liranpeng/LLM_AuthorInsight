rived from adopted parameters in Table 2 and forcing variables in
Table 3. Uncertainties (vertical bars) are standard deviations from
105 monte carlo integrations. Changes are averaged over the 5 years
at the beginning and end of the historical reconstruction due to in-
terannual variability. Note the different vertical scales.
