Research and Forecasting (WRF) physical simulator47 provided by
the Central Weather Administration of Taiwan (CWA)15 (i.e., WRF),
which employs a dynamical downscaling approach. Though
imperfect, WRF is a SOTA model for km-scale weather simulations
and is used operationally by several national weather agencies.
Generative downscaling: corrective diffusion models
The goal of probabilistic downscaling is to mimic the conditional
probability density p(x∣y). To learn p(x∣y) we employ a diffusion
