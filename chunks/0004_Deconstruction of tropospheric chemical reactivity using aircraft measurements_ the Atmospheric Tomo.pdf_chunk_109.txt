L-CO and even less so for L-O3. (iii) CO as expected con-
trols OH and L-CH4. (iv) CH4 is like CO but plays a bigger
role in P-O3 through HOx production via HCHO. (v) HOOH
plays a modest role (S âˆ¼0.06) in OH and thus L-CH4 and
L-CO. (vi) CH3OOH plays a surprisingly large role in P-O3
because of the additional HOx release through HCHO. How-
ever, (vii) the initial HCHO plays a small role in P-O3 be-
cause it is reset quickly by the chemistry in response to the
