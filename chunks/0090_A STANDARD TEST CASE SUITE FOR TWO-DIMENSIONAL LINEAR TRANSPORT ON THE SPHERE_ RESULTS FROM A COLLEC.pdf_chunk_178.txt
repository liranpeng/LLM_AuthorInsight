diffusive schemes tend to collapse toward a straight line with
negative slope for τ approximately in [0.2 : 0.8], whereas the
less diffusive schemes tend toward a straight line with no or
small negative slope. The smoothness of the ℓf curve may in-
dicate non-physical “ad hoc” ﬁxers or anti-diffusive aspects
