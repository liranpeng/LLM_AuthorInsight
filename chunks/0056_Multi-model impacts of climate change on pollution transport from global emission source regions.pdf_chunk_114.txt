Figure 11. CO-tracer (COt) mixing ratio annual-average proﬁles (ppb) averaged over various latitude bands (40◦N, 0, 40◦S) for the 2000s
(present day) and 2090–2099 (RCP 8.5) for (a) UM-CAM, (b) STOC-HadAM3, (c) CMAM, and (d) GISS-E2-R plotted against altitude in
pressure units (hPa) (green) and with distance from the tropopause for the respective time period (blue).
Convective mass ﬂuxes consistently decrease throughout
most of the troposphere in the future in all four CCMs in both
