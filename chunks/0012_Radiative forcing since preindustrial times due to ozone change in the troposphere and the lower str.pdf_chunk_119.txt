the stratosphere: a) a slow down of gas-phase stratospheric
ozone depletion due to temperature reductions, and b) an
increased meridional circulation, which is connected to a
stronger tropical lifting and therefore leads to an ozone de-
crease in the tropical lower stratosphere, as was identiÔ¨Åed
by, e.g., Kinne et al. (1992) and Stenke and Grewe (2005).
Consistently, the three models with detailed stratospheric
chemistry (ULAQ, DLR E39C, and NCAR MACCM) and
