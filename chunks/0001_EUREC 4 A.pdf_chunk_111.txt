to characterize the mesoscale cloud patterns from GOES-
16, MODIS, or ASTER satellite observations (Stevens et al.,
2019b; Mieslinger et al., 2019; Bony et al., 2020; Denby,
2020; Rasp et al., 2021), will make it possible to test cloud-
feedback mechanisms and advance understanding of the pro-
cesses underlying the formation of the mesoscale cloud pat-
terns, as well as whether they inﬂuence the hypothesized
feedback mechanisms.
