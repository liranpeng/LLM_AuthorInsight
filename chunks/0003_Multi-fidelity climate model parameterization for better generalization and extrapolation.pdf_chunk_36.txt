tion, the chosen architecture naturally accommodates outputs
of different dimensions for different fidelity levels. In the
case of inputs of different dimensions for different fidelity
levels, an additional neural network can be added in order to
infer the mapping between the different inputs. Besides, the
chosen architecture naturally ensures uncertainty propagation
between different fidelity levels since low-fidelity predictions
are directly fed as inputs for the high-fidelity model within
