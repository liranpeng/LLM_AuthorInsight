Island–Azores ﬂight. GEOS-5 shows a strong plume around
800 hPa for the ﬁrst hour of the ﬂight, which agrees well with
observations (Fig. 2b, d). The observations show additional
strong plumes in the next hour between 600 and 700 hPa.
These plumes are present but underestimated in GEOS-5,
possibly due to errors in the magnitude of the emissions or
the placement or extent of the plumes. The placement and
strength of simulated plumes is sensitive to the injection
