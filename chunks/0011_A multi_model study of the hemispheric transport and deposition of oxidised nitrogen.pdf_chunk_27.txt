were calculated for each model; these individual results
were then used to calculate the multi-model mean sensitivity
and standard deviations.
[12] When the source and receptor regions are the same,
subtracting the sensitivity from 1 gives the fraction of NOy
that is exported; these export fractions are shown in Figure 2
for each season, using multi-model mean values. In the four
regions shown in Figure 1, almost all of the NOx emissions
result from anthropogenic activities, even with a 20%
