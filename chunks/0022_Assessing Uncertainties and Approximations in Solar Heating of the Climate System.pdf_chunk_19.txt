2.â€‚ Evolving Solar RT Codes
Many of the case studies here follow the ongoing efforts of the scientific community to improve the solar 
heating codes in current climate models. Most of this work is occurring within the major climate modeling 
centers. For example, the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) is 
implementing a new toolbox that seeks to balance accuracy, efficiency, and flexibility in the solar RT code
