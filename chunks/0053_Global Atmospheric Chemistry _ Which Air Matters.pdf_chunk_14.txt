ter vapor (Newell et al., 1992; Dacre et al., 2015; Mundhenk
et al., 2016) in terms of ﬁlamentary appearance and being
dominated by the lower half of the troposphere. Nevertheless,
the methane-loss ﬁlaments do not coincide with atmospheric
rivers (Fig. 1a vs. 1b), indicating that chemical-speciﬁc het-
erogeneity other than tropical water vapor plays a role in
these ﬁne-scale structures (e.g., Ehhalt et al., 1997; Browell
et al., 2003; Charlton-Perez et al., 2009).
