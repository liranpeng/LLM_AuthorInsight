high-HNO3 regions. For NOx the content decreases overall
by 18 %, with most air parcels (4–100 ppt) becoming less
frequent and an increase in frequency only for parcels with
very low NOx, < 4 ppt. The 1-D distribution of HCHO shifts
lightly but with little overall change in content. The lack of
scavenging is even more important for HOOH with an over-
all increase of 41 % and a dramatic shift in the distribution:
decreases in 0.3–1.0 ppb appear as very large increases from
