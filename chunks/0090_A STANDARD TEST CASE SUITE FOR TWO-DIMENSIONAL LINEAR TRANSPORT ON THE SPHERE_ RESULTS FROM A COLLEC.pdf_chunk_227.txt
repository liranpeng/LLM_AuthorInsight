mixing diagnostics are much smaller than for schemes with
similar “minimal” resolutions.
In the last row of Fig. 15, the normalized mixing diagnos-
tics at the “minimal” resolution for the respective schemes
are shown. Had 1λm been a proxy for mixing, all histograms
would have had the same height. Here the outliers described
above are very apparent. This shows that the amount of nu-
merical mixing varies signiﬁcantly even though the ℓ2 error
