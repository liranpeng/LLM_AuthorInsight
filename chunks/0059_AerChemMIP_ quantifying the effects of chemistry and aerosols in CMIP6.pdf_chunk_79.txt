is where it has the largest climate impact) even though it will
generate both ozone and nitrate aerosol in models.
The experimental setup has been designed to pair coupled-
ocean simulations with speciÔ¨Åed SST atmosphere-only ex-
periments to calculate the ERFs due to each category of
forcing agent (see Sect. 3.1.2 for more details). Compari-
son between the temperature and precipitation changes in
the coupled-ocean simulations with the ERFs (top of atmo-
