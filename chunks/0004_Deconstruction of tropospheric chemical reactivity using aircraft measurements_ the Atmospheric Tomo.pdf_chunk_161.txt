30◦in latitude or wider, mostly tropical, with abundances
> 1000 ppt between 1 and 6 km. This pattern is expected with
a large, somewhat homogeneous chemical source of HOOH
that partly follows the sun with each ATom deployment. We
often ﬁnd that the high-NOx regions are separated from the
high-HOOH ones. An unusual block of mid-tropospheric air
was sampled in the South Paciﬁc (30–15◦S) during ATom-3
(Fig. 58). This air mass had uniformly high NOx values (60–
