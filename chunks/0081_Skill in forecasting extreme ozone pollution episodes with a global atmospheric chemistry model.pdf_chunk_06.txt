lution: changing meteorological conditions, shifting back-
ground atmospheric composition, and chemistry–climate in-
teractions that control the efﬁcacy or residence time of
pollutants. All of these factors may alter the efﬁciency
of local emissions in generating pollution events (Weaver
et al., 2009) and need systematic evaluation. Thus, global
chemistry–climate models (CCMs) are a necessary compo-
nent in projecting future air quality on a continental scale
