models (e.g., ref. 209–211); and
(3) The direct calculation of air quality by various global
and regional modeling approaches that include:
(i) Fully coupled global chemistry–climate models (CCMs;
Table S1, ESIz).
(ii) Fully coupled regional CCMs;215–217
(iii) Global-to-urban CCMs (e.g., ref. 218);
(iv) Oﬀ-line global or regional chemical transport models
(CTMs) forced using projections of meteorological ﬁelds from
separate atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs)
