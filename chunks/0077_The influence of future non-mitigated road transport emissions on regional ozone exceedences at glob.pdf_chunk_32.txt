values attained from all members of the ensemble. For instance,
resident mixing ratios of O3 in the boundary layer in a large-scale
CTM are sensitive to the description of the dry deposition term
(Ordóñez et al., 2010), with the model ensemble used here utilizing
a range of different parameterizations to calculate the loss to the
surface. The output from each model is then interpolated onto 40
levels at a T42 resolution for the analysis.
