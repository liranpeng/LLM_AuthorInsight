the upper ocean to the heat uptake averaged over the entire planet.
Diminishing climate feedbacks also exist. Cloud-cover
changes, for example, can either amplify or reduce climate
change (Boucher at al., 2013). Thus, it is not inherent that
amplifying feedbacks should be dominant, but climate mod-
els and empirical data concur that amplifying feedbacks
dominate on both short and long timescales, as we will dis-
cuss. Amplifying feedbacks lead to large climate change in
