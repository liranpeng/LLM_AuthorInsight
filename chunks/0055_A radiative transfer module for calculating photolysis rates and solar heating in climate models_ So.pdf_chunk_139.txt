scattering phase function could be used directly. The par-
ent RRTM-SW code has the option of using a more accurate
16-stream scattering code but would in general be computa-
tionally much more expensive than the eight-stream Solar-J.
The basic costs of the matrix inversions (Fast-J via Feautrier,
1964) or eigenvalue solutions (RRTM via DISORT; Stamnes
et al., 1988) scale as n3. For the same eight-stream solution,
DISORT performs eigenvalue decomposition of 8 Ã— 8 ma-
