aged air parcels. We calculate these rates with 3D chemical
models that include variations in clouds and photolysis and
then assemble the statistical patterns describing the hetero-
geneity (i.e., high spatial variability) of these rates and the
underlying patterns of reactive gases.
Tropospheric O3 and CH4 contribute to climate warm-
ing and global air pollution (Stocker et al., 2013). Their
abundances in the troposphere are controlled largely by tro-
