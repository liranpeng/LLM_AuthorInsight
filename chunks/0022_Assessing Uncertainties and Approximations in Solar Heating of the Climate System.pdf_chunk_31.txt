Averaged liquid-only clouds shown for a range of re-scalings of the Mie scattering phase function (HG, δ-0, δ-1, δ-2). These are all evaluated within the 8-stream 
SJ code. Also shown is the difference RRTMG minus SJ/δ1, where much of the difference, especially in atmospheric heating, is due to the 2-stream minus 
8-stream difference. See Table S1 for a complete description of code versions.
