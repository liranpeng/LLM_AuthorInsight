regular latitude–longitude grid is used. For the experiments
two resolution conﬁgurations are chosen for the two meshes.
For 1λ ≈1.5◦and 1λ ≈0.75◦, the number of polygons on
the initial Voronoi grid is 10 000 and 20 000, respectively.
The associated regular latitude–longitude grid spacings are
1.5◦and 0.75◦. A non-dimensionless time step of T/300
and T /600 was used for the coarser and higher resolutions,
respectively. Trajectories are computed using fourth-order
Runge–Kutta integration.
