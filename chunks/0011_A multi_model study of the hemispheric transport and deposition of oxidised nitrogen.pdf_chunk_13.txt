(between 30 and 50%) was mostly caused by differences in
NOy removal mechanisms between the models.
[4] However, it is not clear from these previous studies
how much NOy is exported from a given region, nor where
regional emissions are ultimately deposited. The work
described here is the first to use results from a series of
multi-model experiments to quantify the impact of emis-
sions of NOx from each of four regions on the others, and
