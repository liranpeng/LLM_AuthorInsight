Extended Data Fig. 2).
For the purpose of compiling national greenhouse-gas inventories 
for reporting data for each country to the climate convention, our 
anthropogenic N2O emission categories are aligned with those used 
in UNFCCC reporting and IPCC 2006 methodologies (Supplementary 
Table 14). We also provide a detailed comparison of our methodol-
ogy and quantification with that of the IPCC assessment report 5 (see 
Supplementary Information section 4, Supplementary Table 15).
