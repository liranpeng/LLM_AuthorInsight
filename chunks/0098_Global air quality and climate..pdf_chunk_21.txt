globally.17,23 Exceptions include ammonia (NH3), which
increases in nearly all scenarios and CH4, which ranges from
a 30% decrease to a more than doubling by 2100 (Fig. 1). We
emphasize that the assumption of aggressive air pollution
measures implemented globally is a major caveat in the
RCP-based projections, as the small range of possible air
pollutant emission trajectories across the RCPs may not
represent the true uncertainty in emission pathways.
