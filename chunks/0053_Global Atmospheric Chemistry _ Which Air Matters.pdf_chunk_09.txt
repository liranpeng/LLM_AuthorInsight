on our modeling of the atmosphere in quantized units such
as gridded cells or 1 s averages. Yet, the concept of distinct
air parcels remains useful for parsing in situ aircraft mea-
surements and for the analysis presented here in which we
ask which air is more important for the chemical evolution
of global tropospheric pollution.
To understand the mix of chemicals in the atmosphere and
where they come from is to recognize how humans have per-
