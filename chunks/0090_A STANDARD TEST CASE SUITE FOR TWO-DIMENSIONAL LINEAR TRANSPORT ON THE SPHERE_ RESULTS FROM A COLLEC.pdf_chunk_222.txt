and the colors show the breakdown into the different cate-
gories of mixing. For example, the histogram for CSLAM-
CN5.5 (unlimited) is of exactly height three, and each col-
ored section is height one.
The speciﬁc choice of CSLAM for the normalization is
motivated by the “minimal” resolution. That is, at 1λ ≈1.5◦
the ﬁlaments are marginally resolved for CSLAM-CN5.5.
The CSLAM scheme performs, in general, a little above av-
