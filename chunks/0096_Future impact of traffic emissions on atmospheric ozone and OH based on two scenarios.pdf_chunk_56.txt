near the surface. This is also reﬂected in the much lower
O3 enhancement efﬁciency for SHIP than for AIR (Table 2).
Similar to AIR, the O3 enhancement efﬁciency is reduced
with time as a response to the increased emissions from an-
thropogenic sources in total. An interesting point regarding
seasonal variations is the much higher sensitivity of O3 mix-
ing ratios in the lower troposphere to changes in ship emis-
sions, and corresponding lower sensitivity of O3 mixing ra-
