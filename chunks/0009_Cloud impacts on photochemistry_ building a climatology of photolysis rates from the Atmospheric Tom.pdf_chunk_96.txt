drops off with altitude as does COD, but peaks at 10â€“20 %
near 200 hPa corresponding to large-scale cirrus. Some of
these differences in COD and CF are large enough to ex-
plain model differences, but there is no clear pattern between
J values and clouds as noted in Sect. 3.2. A more thor-
ough analysis and comparison of the modeled cloud struc-
tures would involve the full climate models and satellite data
