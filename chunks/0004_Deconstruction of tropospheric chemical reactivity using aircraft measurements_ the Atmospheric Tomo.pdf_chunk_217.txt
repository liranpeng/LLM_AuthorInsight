ﬁrst-order estimates and do not include the full set of feed-
backs in a ﬂux-driven, free-running global chemistry model.
Nevertheless, it does provide an independent estimate based
primarily on observations.
The ATom measurements can make a substantial contribu-
tion to understanding model differences and even identifying
model errors in global tropospheric chemistry. What is clear
from this measurement–model analysis since P2017 is that
