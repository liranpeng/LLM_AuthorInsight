50 km and less heating below. Differences at the top, above
50 km, are due in part to the lack of λ < 200 nm radiation in
RRTMG-SW, and in part due to a better resolution of the O3
and O2 cross sections in Solar-J. Overall, RRTMG-SW de-
posits more energy in the lower stratosphere, below 35 km,
except at larger SZA where it deposits less. Thus, for the
tropics and midlatitudes, RRTMG will overheat the lower
