warming, the test dataset also extrapolates to unseen phases
of the SPCAM5 seasonal cycle.
Surrogat models
We provide description of the four surrogate models that are
built for the CAM5/SPCAM5 convection superparameteriza-
tion.
Single-fidelity Randomized Prior Networks
In this work, Bayesian models are constructed using an en-
semble method called Randomized Prior Networks (RPNs)58.
Each member of the RPNs is built as the sum of a trainable
