base values. The mean low-level cloudiness from the GOES estimates is shown in Fig. 6. 
The winds and clouds in the southern parts of the observing areas were occasionally 
perturbed by tropical storms and cyclones moving through or near this area. But these 
perturbations had limited impact on the CSET observations.
During CSET a total of 7 two-flight sequences (14 research flights; RF-02 to RF-15; see 
Table 2) were flown between Sacramento and Kona. Each flight took about 8 hours with
