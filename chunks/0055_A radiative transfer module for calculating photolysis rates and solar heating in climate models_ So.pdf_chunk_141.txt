the UC Irvine chemistry-transport model (CTM). Cloud-J
timings are estimated by comparing full cloud quadrature
(2.75 calls per column atmosphere per time step; see be-
low) versus an average-cloud approximation (1 call). We Ô¨Ånd
that 12 % of the CTM wall-clock time is spent in Cloud-J
using average clouds and 28 % when using cloud quadra-
ture. Because the UCI CTM runs a minimalist tropospheric
chemistry and a linearized stratospheric chemistry (see Hsu
