by aerosols and clouds as uniform across the major bin (see
Sect. 2.2). The ﬁdelity of the spectral extension of Solar-J to
match RRTMG-SW is veriﬁed with the clear-sky case pre-
sented in Sect. 3.1.
2.2
Clouds and aerosols
Like the photolysis rates calculated in Cloud-J, the heat-
ing rates in RRTMG-SW and Solar-J are highly sensitive to
the scattering and absorption from tropospheric and strato-
spheric aerosols, and from liquid-water and ice-water clouds.
