The goal here is to be able to use the NASA ATom aircraft
mission (2015–2020), which was designed to measure those
23 key variables in air parcels proﬁling from near-surface to
12 km altitude, ﬂying ascents and descents down the middle
of the Paciﬁc and Atlantic Ocean basins. Thus ATom data
will not ﬁll the global 3-D model grid, and thus many cells
will be initialized with the model’s original chemistry values.
The critical design requirement is that we let the model inte-
