layerwise anomaly w′ = w −w at a given vertical level. Then the final measure of the variance we are interested 
in is calculated by
The resulting 1D second-moment vector is widely analyzed in the study of atmospheric turbulence as it helps 
characterize the altitudes of most vigorous ­convection55. We average it across a cluster to estimate the convective 
structures present and use it as one metric to discriminate the average physical properties sorted by the VAE
