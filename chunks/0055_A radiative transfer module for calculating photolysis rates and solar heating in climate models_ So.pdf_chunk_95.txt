Table 5. Radiation budget comparison (W m−2) between Solar-J and RRTMG-SW for top of atmosphere (TOA), atmosphere, and surface
across four SZAs. Also shown is the cloud radiative effect (CRE) of a typical marine stratus cloud, for which the atmospheric absorption is
split into above cloud, in cloud, and below cloud, and the values are shown in italics.
