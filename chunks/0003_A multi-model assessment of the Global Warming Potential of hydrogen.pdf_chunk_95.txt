interested in errors that are due to uncertainties in the soil sink and atmospheric
loss, hence we take advantage of the fact that lifetime is burden divided by loss to

Where we have rewritten the lifetime as the hydrogen burden divided by the
loss. Since the lifetime used is the perturbation lifetime, we also need to include the
