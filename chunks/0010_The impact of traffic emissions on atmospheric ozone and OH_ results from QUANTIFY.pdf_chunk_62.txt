tions (Wild et al., 2003), while in the stratosphere, it employs
the stratospheric linear ozone scheme (Linoz) and conducts
linear calculations of (P-L) (Hsu, 2004). Photolysis rates are
calculated by the Fast-JX package (Bian and Prather, 2002).
Transport scheme uses the second order moments (Prather,
1986). Lightning is parameterized with the method of Price
and Rind (1992).
Convection is simulated, following the
ECMWF Tiedtke convection diagnostics.
