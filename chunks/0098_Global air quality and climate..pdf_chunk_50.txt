in a positive aerosol direct eﬀect that is estimated to be between
+0.25 and +0.44 W m2 in model studies78 but potentially as
large as +0.9 W m2 when constrained by observations.79,80
A multi-model assessment by Koch et al.81 shows that global
models underestimate observed aerosol absorption optical
depth (AAOD); scaling model AAOD to match observations
resulted in BC multi-model average direct eﬀect of +0.55 W m2.
The absorption eﬀect of BC in liquid cloud droplets may cause
