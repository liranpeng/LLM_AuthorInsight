common encoder model, we visualize the PDF of each GSRM test dataset, providing valuable insights into the 
intricacies of their respective data distributions.
Figure 5a shows nine resulting PDFs, where the red lines corresponding to ICON, SPCAM, and SAM have 
different distributions than the (blue lines denoting the) other six GSRMs. Specifically, the ELBO PDFs of ICON, 
SPCAM, and SAM are more right-skewed and less symmetric, confirming our earlier findings of a “majority”
