to nine interfaces (Table 2) corresponding to eight finite volume vertical layers. The nine interfaces
were chosen to have a vertical coordinate that corresponds closely to the one in the SPEEDY model
[12]. The uppermost two layers correspond to the stratosphere while the lowermost layer is roughly
a boundary layer average. The following equation, using temperature T as an example, is used to
transform all 3D variables from the 63-layer to 8-layer vertical coordinate:
