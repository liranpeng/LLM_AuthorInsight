veloped by Duncan et al. (2007) to account for the CO source
from non-methane hydrocarbon oxidation.
CO from methane oxidation is included in the non-BB
tagged tracers for the regions in which oxidation occurred.
For example, if methane is oxidized over North America,
the resulting CO is included in the North American non-
BB tracer. The monthly mean methane Ô¨Åelds come from
a GMI chemistry and transport model (CTM) simulation,
which uses prescribed zonal mean surface concentrations.
