for photolysis but not heating rates. Its number of visible broad bands needs to be expanded beyond 2, 
and those cross section adjusted to Watts weighting. Aerosol extinction, but not clouds, also varies widely 
across visible wavelengths, and all solar RT codes may consider testing aerosol wavelength dependence 
across their broad bands. (important, not too difficult, but limited to Solar-J, hence level 1).
