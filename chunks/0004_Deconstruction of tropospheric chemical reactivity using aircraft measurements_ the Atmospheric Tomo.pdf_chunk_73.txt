treme statistics in the Arctic are similar to the PaciÔ¨Åc and
Atlantic except for P-O3 in ATom-234, which is dominated
by hot parcels. Note that we have excluded the stratospheric
parcels in these statistics (see the Supplement of G2023).
The Southern Ocean has high reactivities for ATom-2 and
ATom-3 as expected for austral summer. L-O3 and L-CO are
about half the reactivity of the Arctic for the complementary
seasons, but P-O3 and L-CH4 are more similar to the Arctic.
