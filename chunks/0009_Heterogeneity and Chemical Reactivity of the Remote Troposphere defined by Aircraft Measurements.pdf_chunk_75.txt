Ocean basins are plotted in Fig. 1 and show the importance
of the most reactive “hot” parcels with deeply convex curves
and the sharp upturn in R values above 0.9 cumulative weight
(top 10 %). Both basins show a similar emphasis on the most
reactive hot parcels: 80 %–90 % of total R is in the top 50 %
of the parcels, 25 %–35 % is in the top 10 % and about 10 %–
14 % is in the top 3 %. The corollary is that the bottom 50 %
parcels control only 10 %–20 % of the total reactivity, which
