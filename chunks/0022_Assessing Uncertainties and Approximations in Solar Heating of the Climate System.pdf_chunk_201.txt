(J. K. P. Shonk & Hogan, 2008) that add a second, thinner extension around the primary cloud. The range 
of approaches reflects the basic uncertainty in mapping climate model cloud data (cloud fraction and 
cloud water content) into 3D fields of clouds. For the 1D, or quasi-1D (R. J. Hogan & Bozzo, 2018) RT
