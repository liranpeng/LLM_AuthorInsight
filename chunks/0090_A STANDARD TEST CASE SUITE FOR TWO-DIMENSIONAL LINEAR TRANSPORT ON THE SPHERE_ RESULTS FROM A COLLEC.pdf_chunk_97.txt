The FARSIGHT scheme (White and Dongarra, 2011)
is based on Eq. (10) and discretized on an equiangu-
lar gnomonic cubed-sphere grid. It is an upstream semi-
Lagrangian scheme that computes departure points for each
grid point using backward trajectories based on numerical
derivatives of the wind ﬁeld at the later time. The scheme
then sets φ at each grid point to the interpolated value (third-
order for FARSIGHT) at its departure point. The scheme
