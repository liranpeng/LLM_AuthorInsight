(Table 3). In many CTMs, the CH4 lifetime due to tropo-
spheric OH is shorter than observed and the cause of this
discrepancy remains unknown (e.g., Holmes et al., 2013;
Naik et al., 2013). We Ô¨Ånd that instant dilution produces the
shortest CH4 lifetime of the three plume chemistry scenarios
(9.2 yr). The more realistic treatment of ship plume chem-
istry afforded by the parametric plume model raises the life-
time to 9.4 yr, but the discrepancy with observations remains
