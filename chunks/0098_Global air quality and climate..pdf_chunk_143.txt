advances have been made in characterizing and propagating
uncertainties through the multitude of processes governing the
emission of radiatively active species and their atmospheric
distributions and climate impacts.38,309,310 Additional work is
needed to extend these uncertainty analyses to other chemical
species and anthropogenic sectors. By identifying which pro-
cesses contribute most to uncertainties, these approaches inform
the science community as to where future investments may be
