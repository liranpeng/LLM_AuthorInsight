ing insights by analyzing these data, and for brevity the his-
tograms for this data are omitted (the data are available in
the supplemental material). Except for CAM-FV and FAR-
SIGHT, the divergent data are ordered similarly to 1Î»m in
terms of magnitude (Fig. 3, top). Note that schemes based
on FCT limiting in general improve accuracy when shape
preservation is enforced, whereas schemes based on recon-
struction limiting degrade the error norms.
