Finally, we show that a pretrained ACE network is able to adapt to a new global climate model simulation data set with 10 fewer training steps than when starting from random initialization, all while still maintaining low levels of climate bias. Further analysis of these fine‚Äêtuning experiments reveal ACE's intriguing ability to interpolate between distinct global climate models.
