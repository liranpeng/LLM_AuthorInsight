the residual circulation and stability of the Antarctic spring-
time stratospheric vortex. This new circulation led to early
breakup of stratospheric vortex and weaker ozone holes in
several years. Such phenomena are similar to those seen in
experiments where changing ozone production in the lower
tropical stratosphere caused a dramatic shift in high-latitude
winter variability (Hsu et al., 2013). The temperatures in the
Antarctic winter stratosphere shifted warmer in O3v2, and
