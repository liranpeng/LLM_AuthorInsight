NOx in the UCI CTM, higher temperatures increase both the
production and loss of O3, with net excess production; OH
rises in turn. In GEOS-Chem, by contrast, higher tempera-
tures increase O3 destruction over the ocean with less op-
portunity for enhanced production; OH thus decreases over
oceans.
The sensitivity of τCH4×OH to methane abundance is
closely related to the methane feedback factor, f , which is
the ratio of methane perturbation lifetime to total budget life-
