climate and ozone precursor emissions, but does not consider
changes in halogen loading.
Some of the models were able to perform only subsets
of the deﬁned scenarios.
In particular, the CTMs could
not perform scenario 1 since they do not account for cou-
plings between chemistry and climate.
Six out of the
seven CCMs models did a pre-industrial climate simula-
tion; ﬁve among them scenario 1 and one (UM CAM) sce-
nario 1d, as this model calculates changes in tropospheric
chemistry only.
