contrast to the principle of Occamâ€™s razor. Indeed, the paper
by Turner et al. (25) considers the parsimonious case that meth-
ane loss frequency is constant over the period and they find a
nearly optimal solution.
Both Rigby et al. and Turner et al. suggest that
oxidation of methane by tropospheric OH
increased from the 1990s through the 2000s and
that this loss process was mainly responsible for
the brief plateau in global mean methane.
