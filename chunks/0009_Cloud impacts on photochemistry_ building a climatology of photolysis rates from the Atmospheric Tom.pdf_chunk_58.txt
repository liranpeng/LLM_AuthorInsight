troposphere when clouds lie overhead. In upper tropospheric
layers (100–300 hPa), most of the optically thick clouds are
below and rlnJ > 0.00 is dominant. Thus, our analysis here
breaks the atmosphere into these three layers. All ﬁgures in
this section will be displayed as two-block by three-layer
