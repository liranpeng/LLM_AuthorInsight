at about 800 m, with relative uniform sampling of the trade
wind moist layer by the Twin Otter. Figure 3 also shows the
strong emphasis on sampling the lower atmosphere, with rel-
atively uniform coverage of the lower 3 km. Except for the
Twin Otter, which was limited to daytime operations, takeoff
and landing times of the aircraft were staggered, with three
night ï¬‚ights by the P-3, to better sample the diurnal cycle.
Data papers for the individual platforms are being prepared
