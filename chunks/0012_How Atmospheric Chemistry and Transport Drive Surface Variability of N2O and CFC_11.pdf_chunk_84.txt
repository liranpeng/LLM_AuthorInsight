ospheric chemistry or emissions for N2OX and F11X. The N2O loss due to O1D in the troposphere, 1% of the 
budget (Hsu & Prather, 2010), is not included here. Therefore, the observed surface QBO signal provides an 
unambiguous test of STE of N2O-depleted air on sub-decadal time scales. We compare modeled N2OX with 
NOAA ESRL surface observations of N2O (Dlugokencky et al., 2019) over years 2001–2016.
