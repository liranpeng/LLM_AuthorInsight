ison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) [Eyring et al., 2013]. Here we are able to diagnose accurate STE of O3 based on
the TC and LS methods to verify if the BD approximation is valid.
Here O3 STE is diagnosed in two separate simulations driven by two diﬀerent cycles (29r1 versus 36r1) of
ECMWF-IFS data over similar time periods (see section 2.1). For each simulation, the O3 STE calculated by the
TC method uses the tropopause deﬁned by the synthetic tracer e90 [Prather et al., 2011] and serves as the
