simulation of the transition between the two convective regimes. The Lagrangian approach 
allowed us to track air masses as they flowed from colder to warmer sea surface 
temperatures and thus minimize uncertainties in the large-scale forcing due to horizontal 
advection in the lower troposphere. This approach facilitates comparison with Lagrangian 
model simulations and the isolation of critical physical processes operating in the cloud 
evolution.
