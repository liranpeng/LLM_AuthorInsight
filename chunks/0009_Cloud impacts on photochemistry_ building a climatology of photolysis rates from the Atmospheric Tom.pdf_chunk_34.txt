able in deterministic chemistry transport models. The Cloud-
J approach (Prather, 2015) developed a scale-independent
1-D method for cloud overlap based on vertical decorrela-
tion lengths (Barker, 2008a, b). The chemistry models here
use a variety of these methods, which range from lookup
tables with correction factors, to Fast-J single column, to
cloud overlap treatments with Cloud-J; see Table 1. Cur-
rently these models do not attempt to deÔ¨Åne 3-D cloud struc-
