During
winter the average effect of road trafﬁc on ozone in the highly
industrialized regions of the extratropics almost vanishes or
even changes sign, i.e. an increase of road emissions leads to
a decrease of ozone during winter. Often under stable bound-
ary layer conditions the emissions accumulate, on average
to more than 2 ppbv over the industrialized centers over the
eastern US, Europe and parts of East Asia (not shown). Un-
der these conditions additional NOx from (road) trafﬁc lo-
