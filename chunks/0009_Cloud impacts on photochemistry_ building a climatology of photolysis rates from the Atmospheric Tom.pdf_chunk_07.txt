time. The ATom-1 measurements generally favor large cloud
effects but are not precise or robust enough to point out the
best cloud-modeling approach. The models here have resolu-
tions of 50–200 km and thus reduce the occurrence of clear
sky when averaging over grid cells. In situ measurements
also average scattered sunlight over a mixed cloud ﬁeld, but
only out to scales of tens of kilometers. A primary uncer-
tainty remains in the role of clouds in chemistry, in partic-
