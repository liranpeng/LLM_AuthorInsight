packages in LLNL-CESM and for the first time demonstrated how
change in O2 photolysis rate within its uncertainty range can
significantly impact on the stratospheric climate and ozone
abundances. From the UCI side, this proposal also helped LLNL
develop a CAM-Superfast Chemistry model that was implemented
for the IPCC AR5 and contributed chemical-climate simulations to
CMIP5.
