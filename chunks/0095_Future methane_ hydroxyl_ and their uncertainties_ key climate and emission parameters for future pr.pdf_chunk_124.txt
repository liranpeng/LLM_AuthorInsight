(GEOS-Chem/MERRA) has little impact on present-day
τCH4×OH variability (Sect. 3.3).
The parametric model predicts τCH4×OH will increase
+12.9 ± 10.8 % by 2100 (Fig. 7). MAGICC gives similar
results (+12.6 %), but the IPCC TAR formula yields a larger
result (+29.7 %), consistent with their respective historical
performances in Sect. 4. The ACCMIP model ensemble pre-
dicts +8.5 ± 10.4 % for RCP 8.5 (Voulgarakis et al., 2012).
Lightning NOx emissions likely explain the τCH4×OH differ-
