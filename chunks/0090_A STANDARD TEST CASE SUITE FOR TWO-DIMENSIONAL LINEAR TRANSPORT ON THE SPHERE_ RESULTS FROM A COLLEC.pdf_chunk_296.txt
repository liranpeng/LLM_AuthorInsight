the truncation wave number is TL239, and 1t is 5/240 (CN =
5.2) and 5/1200 (CN = 1.0). For the minimal resolutions,
1λm = 2.25◦(for CN = 5.2) and 1λm = 2.25◦(CN = 1.0),
the truncation wave number is TL79 and TL159, respec-
tively, with 1t = 5/80 and 1t = 5/800.

SFF-CSLAM
SFF-CSLAM uses an equiangular gnomonic cubed-sphere
projection. The scheme is available for either a third-order
or fourth-order reconstruction, in both cases using a ﬁnite-
