bins separately. This could be difﬁcult to deﬁne, but the anal-
ysis would be partitioned automatically into all bins by the
system.
Benedetti et al. (2009) made the choice to use the 3-D to-
tal aerosol concentration as the control variable. This makes
the control variable smaller, corresponding to a 3-D variable,
where all bins are merged into a single one. Considering the
characteristics of our system, we decided to follow the same
approach as in Benedetti et al. (2009). Compared to the Liu
