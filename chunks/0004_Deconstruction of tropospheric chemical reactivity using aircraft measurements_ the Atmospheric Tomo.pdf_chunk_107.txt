has unusually low P-O3 values. Surprisingly, the initial val-
ues of many species have a negligible or small impact on the
reactivities. Species like alkanes and alkenes are unimportant
because their average abundances are low over the oceans,
and species like HCHO and HNO4 are unimportant because
their abundances are reset by the chemistry during the 24 h
integration.
The lessons from Table 2 are quite interesting. (i) T , H2O
(Q), and O3 are absolutely critical for all the chemical bud-
