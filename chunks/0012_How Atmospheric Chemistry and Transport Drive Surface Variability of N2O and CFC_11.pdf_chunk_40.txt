the CTMs simulate an artificial tracer N2OX like that in Hamilton and Fan (2000). N2OX is initialized as 
N2O at the beginning of the simulations, has the same stratospheric chemical loss frequency as N2O, has no 
sources or emissions, and thus decays at a semi-regular rate of about 0.8%/yr (see Figure 1 for loss frequency 
and supplementary Figure S1a for change in burden (TgN) of N2O versus N2OX). With the decaying N2OX
