We identify key species (e.g., O3, NOx, HNO3, HNO4,
C2H3NO5, H2O, HOOH, CH3OOH, HCHO, CO, CH4,
C2H6, acetaldehyde, acetone) and presume that they can be
measured simultaneously in air parcels on the scale of a few
km horizontally and a few tenths of a km vertically. As a
ﬁrst step, six global models have prepared such climatolo-
gies sampled at the modeled resolution for August with em-
phasis on the vast central Paciﬁc Ocean basin. Objectives
