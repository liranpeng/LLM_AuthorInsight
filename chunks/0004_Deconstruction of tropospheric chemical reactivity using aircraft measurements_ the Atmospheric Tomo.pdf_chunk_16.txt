Photolysis of NO2 (J-NO2):
NO2 + hv →NO + O.

These rates are readily diagnosed in most CCMs. We found
that the net P-O3 minus L-O3 describes the 24 h O3 tenden-
cies over the ocean basins but not exactly as expected, and
particularly not in highly polluted regions (G2023). Reac-
tion (2c) is important in the tropospheric budget of O3 only
above ATom ﬂight levels (12 km, Prather, 2009). In terms of
the overall CO budget, we lack the chemical production of
