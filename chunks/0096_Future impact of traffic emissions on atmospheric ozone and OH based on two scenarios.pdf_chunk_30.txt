5. The UCI CTM (Wild et al., 2003; Hsu et al., 2005) was
implemented by the University of California, and run
with T42 horizontal resolution and 40 vertical layers.
The model includes both tropospheric and stratospheric
chemistry – the latter being calculated using a linearized
ozone scheme (Linoz).
6. MOCAGE (Teyss`edre et al., 2007) was operated by
M´et´eo-France and used at a resolution of T21 hori-
zontally, and 60 vertical layers. Both tropospheric and
