with distinct wavelength shifts: the second deep SSA minimum for liquid occurs about 1.9 µm, while that 
for ice occurs about 2.0 µm. The largest differences in the liquid versus ice curves here are caused by particle 
size, with smaller particles having larger SSA. The 9 infrared bands (#19–#27 in Figure 3) are denoted with 
the vertical dashed lines. The average cloud SSA in each bin is shown by the horizontal bar with a circle.
