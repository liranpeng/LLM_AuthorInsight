mate change, while the CTMs have kept the climate ﬁxed at
year 2000 conditions. The study shows that, even though
state-of-the-art models have been used, the uncertainty in
modeling ozone change since the pre-industrial time is still
large. However, key ﬁndings concerning the global-mean
tropospheric ozone change and its resulting radiative forcing
are rather robust.
The simulated change of the globally and annually av-
eraged tropospheric ozone column seems to be rather ro-
