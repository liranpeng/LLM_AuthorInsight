Transport of “rough” distribution: slotted cylinder
To assess how schemes perform with a rough (discontinu-
ous) initial condition, we show contour plots of solutions at
t = T /2 for slotted-cylinder initial conditions and the same
non-divergent ﬂow as used in all tests above. The slotted
cylinder has been used extensively in the solid-body ad-
