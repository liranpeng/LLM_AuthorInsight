The model includes a detailed, on-line chemistry
scheme with about 80 chemical species and 400 chemical
reactions. Two different model versions were used. In the
“standard” model, natural and anthropogenic emissions are
largely based on Wang et al. (1998). Monthly mean ﬂuxes
of ozone and NOy across the model tropopause are speciﬁed
as in Wang et al. (1998). Like most other chemistry models,
the “standard” model overestimates preindustrial ozone con-
