waters that were obtained from ref. 36, ref. 35 and ref. 51. Because the data 
(rivers, reservoirs, and estuaries) provided in ref. 35 and ref. 51 are for the 
year 2000, we assume that these values are constant during 1980â€“2016. 
Ref. 36 provided annual riverine N2O emissions using the DLEM model 
during the same period. Here, we averaged estimates from ref. 36 with 
those from ref. 35. In addition, we estimated N2O emissions from global
