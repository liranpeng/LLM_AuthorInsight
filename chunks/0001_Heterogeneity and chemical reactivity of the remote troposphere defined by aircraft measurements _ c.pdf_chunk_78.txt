but the ampliﬁed σ(R) values (14 %–32 %) are inexplicable.
This discrepancy needs to be resolved before using these two
models for ATom RDS analysis.
Inter-model differences are shown in the parcel-by-parcel
root-mean-square (rms) differences for RDS-0 in Table 3.
Even when models adopt standard kinetic rates and cross sec-
tions (i.e., Burkholder et al., 2015), the number of species and
chemical mechanisms included, as well as the treatment of
