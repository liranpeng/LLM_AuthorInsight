lines (e.g., temperature, water vapor, convection, lightning,
biogenic emissions); (3) climate-driven changes in the me-
teorological regimes over polluted regions that lead to AQX
episodes; and (4) changes in the efÔ¨Åcacy of local emissions to
generate pollution within a governance region (e.g., air qual-
ity management district, an EU country). While these fac-
tors are all part of a coupled system, an integrated model that
combines all would be almost impossible to verify. Thus an
