Atmospheric chemistry controls the abundances and hence climate
forcing of important greenhouse gases including N2O, CH4, HFCs,
CFCs, and O3. Attributing climate change to human activities
requires, at a minimum, accurate models of the chemistry and
circulation of the atmosphere that relate emissions to abundances.
