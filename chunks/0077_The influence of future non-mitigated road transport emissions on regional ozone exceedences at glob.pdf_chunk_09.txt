For these regions the area of exceedence (ER > 1.0) for 2025 is w40% and w25% of the total area of each
region, respectively. Comparing simulations employing the various scenarios shows that unmitigated
RTE increases the area of exceedence in the Middle East by w6% and, for Asia, by w2% of the total
regional areas. For the USA the area of exceedence approximately doubles in 2025 as a result of un-
