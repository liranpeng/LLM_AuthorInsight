the deﬁned tropopause, and this extra step can introduce major errors into the STE estimates [Gettelman
and Sobel, 2000].
This paper examines the consistency of the magnitude, location, and interannual variability of O3 STE as
calculated using these three methods. For TC diagnostics, the accuracy of O3 ﬂuxes across a deﬁned 3-D
tropopause-like surface (see section 2.2) is subject only to the model’s ﬁnite temporal and spatial resolutions
