and 0.4 in log10(q), see Table S9. Both models have simi-
lar scatter patterns for T and for q (Fig. S11) with a number
of parcels having log10(q) more than a factor of 10 different
from the stream. In this sensitivity test, UCI CTM ran with
just T from GFDL and NCAR, and then with both T and q
(4 cases in all). The results are shown in Tables S8 and Fig. 9.
For T alone, the reactivity differences were at the lower limit
of detectable modelâ€“model differences but, with both T and
