prior solar cycle to the current solar cycle is of the order
of −0.1 W m−2, which is not negligible but small compared
with greenhouse gas climate forcing. On the other hand, the
variation of solar irradiance from solar minimum to solar
maximum is of the order of 0.25 W m−2, so the high solar ir-
radiance in 2011–2015 contributes to the increase in Earth’s
energy imbalance between 2005 and 2010 as well as 2010
and 2015.
