JX or simply Fast-J (see Søvde et al., 2012; Telford et al.,
2013; Sukhodolov et al., 2016), were based on the work
of Fast-J2 (Bian and Prather, 2002) and the original Fast-J
(Wild et al., 2000), separately optimizing the absorptions of
photon ﬂuxes into 12 stratospheric bins (177–292 nm) and
seven tropospheric bins (292–850 nm). Although this is the
ﬁrst version of Solar-J, we retain the numbering of the re-
leased versions of the core photolysis code. For simplicity,
