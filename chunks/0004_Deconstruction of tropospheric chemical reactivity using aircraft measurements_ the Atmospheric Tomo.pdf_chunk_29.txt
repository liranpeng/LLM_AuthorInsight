documented in Fig. 5. Species with no sources because emis-
sions are shut off decrease over the 24 h (CO, C2H6, alkane,
alkene). NOx systematically decreases because there are no
direct emissions and HNO3 is a major sink. HOOH system-
atically increases because wet scavenging is turned off. O3
and PAN show plus–minus scatter. HNO3 increases at values
less than 2 ppb but decreases at the highest values (∼3 ppb).
In terms of the calculation of ATom reactivities, the scatter is
