tions are too short to distinguish a true anthropogenic-forced
climate signal from internally generated climate variability (see
also Nolte et al.223). The ranges in Fig. 3 reﬂect spatial
variability as well as diﬀerences across models, including in
simulation length, scenarios, and reported O3 statistics and
thus are not a good measure of the true uncertainty. For
example, the multi-model annual, spatial averages with
standard deviations that bracket zero240 are the net sum of
