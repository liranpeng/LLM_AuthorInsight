from the smoothed synthetic data stream derived from model
output (50 × 50 × 1 km averages) to the high variability of in
situ ATom observations (2 × 2 × ∼0.1 km averages).
Based on our experience comparing models that differ
largely by temperature and water vapor, we conclude that wa-
ter vapor differences in CCM simulations of past and future
atmospheres may be a major cause of the changes in O3 and
CH4 and may lead to different chemistry-climate feedbacks
across the models.
