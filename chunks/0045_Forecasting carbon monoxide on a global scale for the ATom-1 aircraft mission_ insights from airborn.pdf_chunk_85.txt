and 75th percentiles; and maximum in monthly mean August
CO for each region over the 2000–2016 period for MOPITT
(CO column and CO at 700 hPa) and 2004–2016 for MLS
(CO at 215 hPa). The corresponding time series are shown in
Fig. 10. The variability in CO BB emissions from the Global
Fire Emissions Database version 4 (GFEDv4) (van der Werf
et al., 2017) for 2000–2016 is also shown for BB regions that
may affect the ATom ﬂights. The BB emissions are averaged
