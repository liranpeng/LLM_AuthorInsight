responses. Baseline surface O3 is very likely to decrease in a
warmer climate because higher water vapor abundances will
enhance O3 destruction in low-NOx regions of the atmosphere
and lead to shorter O3 lifetimes.234 The increase in temperature
itself has little impact on O3 in these regions.228 Climate-driven
increases in lightning NOx and exchange of stratospheric O3
