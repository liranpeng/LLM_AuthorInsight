parcel (deÔ¨Åned typically as a rectilinear box bounded by lat-
itude, longitude, and pressure surfaces). Clouds layers, how-
ever, have horizontal scales of a few kilometers (Slobodda
et al., 2015), and thus are represented in global and regional
models as fractional coverage in each parcel. In calculating
the average photolysis or heating rates through the column
atmosphere, one must know how the cloud fractions overlap.
Early modeling assumed that model layers consisted of max-
