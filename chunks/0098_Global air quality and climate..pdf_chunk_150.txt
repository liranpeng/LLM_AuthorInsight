sea-salt aerosols contribute to O3 destruction and may play
an important role in both pre-industrial and present-day O3
budgets and tropospheric oxidizing capacity.330–335 Tropo-
spheric halogen chemistry is not included in the model projec-
tions reviewed here (Fig. 3–6).
Reducing uncertainty in aerosol forcing
A new generation of global models allows deeper study at the
process level as they include aerosol microphysics and prognostic
