denoising process, the model iteratively refines the samples,
bringing them closer to the target data distribution. The denoising
neural network plays a critical role in this convergence, providing
the necessary guidance to steer the samples towards accurate
representations of the original data.
The development of CorrDiff was motivated by the limitations
observed when using conditional diffusion models to directly learn
p(xâˆ£y). This approach showed slow convergence and resulted in
