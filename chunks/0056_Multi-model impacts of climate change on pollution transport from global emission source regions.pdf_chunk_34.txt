Under RCP 8.5 the increase in global mean surface temper-
ature between 2081 and 2100, relative to 1986–2005, is pro-
jected to be 2.6–4.8 ◦C averaged across all (∼39) participat-
ing GCMs (Collins et al., 2013). For the four models used
here the global mean surface temperature change between
1996–2005 and 2090–2099 is 3.1–4.6 ◦C.
The CO-like tracer was implemented as a chemically in-
