We can use this information to colorize the vertical velocity samples in the latent space, as shown in Figs. 3

Variational autoencoders
Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are widely-used latent-variable models for high-dimensional density estimation 
and non-linear dimensionality ­reduction21. VAEs differ from regular autoencoders in that (1) both encoders
