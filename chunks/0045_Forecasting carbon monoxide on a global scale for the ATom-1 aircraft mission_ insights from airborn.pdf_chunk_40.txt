and the decrease in Asian non-BB CO explains the observed
decrease in CO as the ﬂights move south.
The observations show plumes of enhanced CO scattered
throughout all three Paciﬁc ﬂights, although they are most
intense in the North Paciﬁc, as seen in the Anchorage–
Kona ﬂight. GEOS-5 typically reproduces the timing of these
plumes, but the magnitude is usually underestimated, partic-
ularly for the strongest plumes. This leads to an underesti-
