is referred to as slope-limiting (e.g., van Leer, 1977). For an
overview of shape-preserving ﬁlters used for the schemes in
this intercomparison, see Table 2. The following subsections
provide brief descriptions of the models that fall into the ﬂux-
form ﬁnite-volume category.

Taylor series approach
The scheme of Skamarock and Gassmann (2011), here re-
ferred to as MPAS as it was implemented in the “Model
for Prediction Across Scales” framework (Skamarock et al.,
