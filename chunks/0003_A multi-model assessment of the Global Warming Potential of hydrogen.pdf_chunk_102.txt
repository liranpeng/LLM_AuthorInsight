(chemical gases and aerosols) and a complex set of photolytic, bi-molecular, tri-
molecular, and heterogeneous reactions. The model has aerosol modules for sulfate,
nitrate, black carbon, primary organic carbon, secondary organic aerosols, mineral
dust, and sea salt (Lund et al. 2018)53. Based on estimates of natural and
anthropogenic emissions, dry-deposition velocities, wet-deposition for water-
soluble species, and solved chemical reactions, changes in the atmospheric com-
