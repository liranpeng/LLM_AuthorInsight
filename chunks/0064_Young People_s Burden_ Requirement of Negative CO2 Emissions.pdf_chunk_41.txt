decade.5 The period since 1970 is the time with high growth
rate of GHG climate forcing, which has been maintained at
approximately +0.4 W m−2 decade−1 (see Sect. 6 below)6
causing Earth to be substantially out of energy balance
(Cheng et al., 2017). The energy imbalance drives global
warming, so unless and until there is substantial change in
the rate of added climate forcing we expect the underlying
warming to continue at a comparable rate.
