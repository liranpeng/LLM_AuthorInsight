Random seed ensemble
Because long-term climate skill is not entirely constrained by the 6-hour prediction that is our training
objective, we train an ensemble of 5 models which vary only in terms of their initialization random
seed. Although validation loss is very similar between the models and all models are capable of stable
10-year forecasts, the magnitude of climate biases varies by up to a factor of 4 (depending on output
