due to stratospheric change is shown only for the models that calculate stratospheric chemistry explicitly. Model numbering as in Table 1.
For “2 minus 1” only coupled CCMs are shown. The radiative forcing calculations are made by the UiO-RTM, and the tropopause level is
based on the NCEP year 2000 reanalysis.
