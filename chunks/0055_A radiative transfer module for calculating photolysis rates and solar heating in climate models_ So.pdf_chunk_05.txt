scattering. Discrepancies with the cirrus cloud using any of
RRTMG-SW’s three different parameterizations are as large
as about 20–40 % depending on the solar zenith angles and
occur throughout the atmosphere.
Effectively, Solar-J has combined the best components of
RRTMG-SW and Cloud-J to build a high-ﬁdelity module for
the scattering and absorption of sunlight in the Earth’s at-
mosphere, for which the three major components – wave-
