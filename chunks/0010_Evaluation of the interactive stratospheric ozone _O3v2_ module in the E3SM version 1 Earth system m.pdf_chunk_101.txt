ozone abundances in the lowermost stratosphere. We cor-
rected this with a new ozone module, O3v2, and document
the results here. We also built some performance metrics for
stratospheric ozone that will become a standard part of E3SM
diagnostics. The UCI model, which uses the same O3 chem-
istry as O3v2 but is driven by ECMWF forecast Ô¨Åelds, pro-
duced only slightly better results, indicating the stratospheric
transport in E3SMv1 is reasonably represented. This is some-
