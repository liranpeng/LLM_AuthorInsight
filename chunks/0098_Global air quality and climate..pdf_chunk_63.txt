these trends. Precipitation responses to changes in aerosol
optical depth, anthropogenic aerosols, and speciÔ¨Åc fuel emis-
sions sectors have been documented in several modeling
studies (e.g., ref. 5, 31 and 128). Some studies have noted that
the sign of the precipitation response to BC depends on the
BC vertical distribution122,129 although this is poorly con-
strained in current models.81,130 Shindell et al.131 point out
that controlling anthropogenic aerosols should restore disrupted
