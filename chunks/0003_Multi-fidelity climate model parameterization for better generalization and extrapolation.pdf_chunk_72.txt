Datasets
All CAM5 and SPCAM5 simulations considered commence
using climatological input data derived from a 20-year mean
span around the year 2000. This data includes relevant so-
lar radiation, greenhouse gas levels, oxidant concentrations,
and present-day aerosol emissions (denoted as F2000). The
prescribed SST and sea ice data sets were constructed as a
blended product, using the global HadISST OI data set82. The
considered forcing consists of annually repeating climatolog-
