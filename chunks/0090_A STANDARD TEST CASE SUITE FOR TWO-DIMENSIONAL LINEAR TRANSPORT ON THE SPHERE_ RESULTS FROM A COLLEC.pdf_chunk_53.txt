pliﬁed so that only the sub-grid-scale reconstruction imme-
diately upstream of the cell edge is used even though the ﬂux
area may overlap more than one Eulerian cell. As discussed
in Lauritzen et al. (2011a), this simpliﬁcation may lead to
some cancellation of errors for sufﬁciently small CNs. The
integration of the ﬂux region in SFF-CSLAM is performed
via fourth-order Gaussian quadrature of third- and fourth-
order accurate reconstruction polynomial functions (Ullrich
