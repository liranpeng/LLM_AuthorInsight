the air parcels and hopefully may become standard for tro-
pospheric chemistry campaigns. We ﬁnd that the reactivity
of the troposphere with respect to O3 and CH4 is dominated
by a fraction of the air parcels but not by so small and infre-
quent a fraction as to challenge the ability of current CTMs
to simulate these observations and thus be used to study the
oxidation budgets. In comparing ATom results with modeled
climatologies, we ﬁnd a systematic ATom–model difference:
