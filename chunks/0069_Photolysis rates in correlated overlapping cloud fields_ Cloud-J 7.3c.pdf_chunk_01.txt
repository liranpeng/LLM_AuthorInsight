Abstract. A new approach for modeling photolysis rates
(J values) in atmospheres with fractional cloud cover has
been developed and is implemented as Cloud-J – a multi-
scattering eight-stream radiative transfer model for solar ra-
diation based on Fast-J. Using observations of the vertical
correlation of cloud layers, Cloud-J 7.3c provides a practi-
cal and accurate method for modeling atmospheric chem-
