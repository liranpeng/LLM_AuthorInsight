are visible in satellite observations of CO (e.g., Edwards et
al., 2004, 2006; Logan et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2013). Pﬁster
et al. (2010) used a chemistry transport model (CTM) as well
as satellite data to examine the CO sources and transport over
the Paciﬁc during the INTEX-B mission compared to previ-
ous years. They found biomass burning to be the largest con-
tributor to interannual variability, despite its lower emissions
compared to fossil fuel sources. Here we show how the time
