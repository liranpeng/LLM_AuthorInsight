participated (BCC-CSM-1, CanESM2, CESM1-BGC, GFDL-ESM2G, HadGem-2ES, INMCM4, IPSLCM5-LR, MIROC-ESM, MPI-ESM-LR, MRI-ESM1, and Nor-ESM1-ME), running the RCP8.5 anthropogenic 
emission scenario forced by the RCP8.5 climate change scenario (see Figure 12.36). All abundances are mid-year. Projected values for SRES A2 and B1 and IS92 are the average of reference models 
taken from the TAR Appendix II.
