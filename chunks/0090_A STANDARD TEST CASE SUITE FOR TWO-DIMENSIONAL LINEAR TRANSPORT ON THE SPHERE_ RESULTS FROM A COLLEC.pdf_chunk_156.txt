Fig. 3. Histogram of minimal resolution 1λm (upper), Ki, i = 2,∞, which are the “optimal” convergence rates for ℓ2 (middle) and ℓ∞
(lower), for the unlimited (“un”, red) and shape-preserving (“sp”, green) versions of the schemes. The histogram is ordered monotonically
according to 1λm for the unlimited schemes so that 1λ decreases from left to right. For schemes for which unlimited results are not
