the deterministic NN. one in the temperate zone, and the LF-RPN model improving further upon the SF-HF-RPN model within
the temperate zone and even within the tropics and polar regions.
For all vertical levels considered, the MF-RPN model improves even further compared to all other models across all regions,
while still showing some negative R2 values for this extrapolation task like all other models. For the pressure level 494 hPa,
