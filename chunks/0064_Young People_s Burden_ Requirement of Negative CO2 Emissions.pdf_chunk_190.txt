forcing of −0.25 W m−2 for non-CO2 gases would allow
CO2 to be 365 ppm, rather than 350 ppm, while yielding the
same total GHG forcing. Absolute reduction of non-CO2
gases is thus helpful but does not alter the requirement for
rapid fossil fuel emission reductions. Moreover, this is an op-
timistic scenario that is unlikely to occur in the absence of a
reduction of CO2, which is needed to limit global warming
and thus avoid amplifying GHG feedbacks.
