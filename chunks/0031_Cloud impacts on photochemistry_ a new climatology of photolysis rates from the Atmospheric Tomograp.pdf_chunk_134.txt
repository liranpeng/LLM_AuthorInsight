each grid cell being either cloudy or clear. The calculation of
photolysis and solar heating rates is not simpliﬁed, however,
because now the SCAs interact with neighbors. Calculating
the correct rates at any location, or even the average over a
region, would require that we calculate the ratio of cloudy to
clear over a 20 km domain of cloud-resolved grid cells.

for the plots and analysis are extensive (∼10 GB) and will be
