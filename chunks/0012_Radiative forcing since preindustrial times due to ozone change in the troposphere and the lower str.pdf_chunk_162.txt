slightly negative amounting to −0.01 Wm−2 in both cases.
It has to be noted that the ULAQ-RTM takes into account
ozone change up to an altitude of 71 km, which is the up-
per boundary of the ULAQ model. Apart from the differ-
ent meteorological conditions used in the ULAQ-RTM, the
additional ozone column reduction between 30 and 71 km
explains in part the different forcings compared to the UiO-
RTM calculations.
