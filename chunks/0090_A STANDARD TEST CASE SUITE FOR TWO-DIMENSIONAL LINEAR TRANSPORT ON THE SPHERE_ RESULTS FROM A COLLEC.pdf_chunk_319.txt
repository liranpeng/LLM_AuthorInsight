the cell along the transported direction), monotonic within a
cell (L = 2, before transport, the moments in the transported
dimension are adjusted to have a positive-deÔ¨Ånite, monotonic
distribution), and the most rigorous shape preserving (L = 3,
the moments in the daughter cell are adjusted after transport
to ensure that the tracer distribution throughout the cell is
limited by the minimum and maximum tracer values using
the moments in the parent cell(s)). All calculations shown
