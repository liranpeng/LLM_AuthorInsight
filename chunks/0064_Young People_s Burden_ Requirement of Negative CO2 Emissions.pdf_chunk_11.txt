the temperature increase to 1.5 ◦C above the pre-industrial

Global surface temperature has many merits as the prin-
cipal metric for climate change, but additional metrics, such
as atmospheric CO2 amount and Earth’s energy imbalance,
help reﬁne targets for avoiding dangerous human-made cli-
mate change. Paleoclimate data and observations of Earth’s
