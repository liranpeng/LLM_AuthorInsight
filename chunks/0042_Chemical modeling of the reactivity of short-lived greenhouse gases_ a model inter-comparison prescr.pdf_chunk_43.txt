and lower (p > 600 hPa, blue). Percentiles (10th, 50th, 90th)
in each dimension are plotted as red dash-dot lines, and thus
most points in the well correlated L-CH4 vs. L-O3 lie along
the 3 quasi-diagonal intersections of red lines. The right-
angle separation of high P -O3 and high L-O3 in the trop-

upper troposphere and the largest L-O3 is from wet environ-
