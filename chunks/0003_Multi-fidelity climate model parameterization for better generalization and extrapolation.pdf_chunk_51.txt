the extrapolation scenario of interest and also the LF-RPN ca-
pacity to resolve the moisture convection stochasticity since it
is an ensemble method. Finally, the MF-RPN model improves
even further upon the LF-RPN model across all regions with
a nearly perfect R2 score in the temperate zone. The MF-RPN
model also shows better results for all tropical regions (fig-
ure 3 and figure in Supplementary Information). This result
is of a significant importance since we are extrapolating to
