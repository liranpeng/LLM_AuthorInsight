Sect. 10.8.4 of IPCC (2013), i.e., TCRE = TCR × CAF/C0,
where C0 = preindustrial atmospheric CO2 mass = 590 PgC
and CAF = Catm/Csum, Catm = atmospheric CO2 mass mi-
nus C0 and Csum = cumulative CO2 emissions (all evaluated
at year 2100).
We ﬁnd TCRE = 1.54 ◦C per 1000 PgC at 2100 with
constant emissions (which yields cumulative emissions of
1180 PgC at 2100, which is near the midpoint of the range
assessed by IPCC, i.e., 0.8 to 2.5 ◦C per 1000 PgC (IPCC,
