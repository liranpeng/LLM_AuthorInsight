heterogeneity (Köppe et al., 2009).
A much more difﬁcult problem is that of representative-
ness: i.e., how much of the Paciﬁc basin must one sample
to get joint-probability distributions similar to that of the
whole basin? Can aircraft-measured heterogeneity be com-
pared with models that do not follow the exact ﬂight route
for the exact period of measurements (e.g., Hsu et al., 2004)?
This latter question is critical if we are to use the ATom
