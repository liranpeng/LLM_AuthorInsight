integrated radiative forcing to a 1 kg pulse emission of a gas over
100 years. Since hydrogen perturbs many gases, we have summed
all forcing contributions, assuming that all perturbations from the
initial hydrogen pulse have decayed, so the steady-state calcula-
tion will match the integrated transient (see Methods). Figure 4
shows the hydrogen GWP100 values for all models, split into the
contribution from methane, ozone, and stratospheric water
