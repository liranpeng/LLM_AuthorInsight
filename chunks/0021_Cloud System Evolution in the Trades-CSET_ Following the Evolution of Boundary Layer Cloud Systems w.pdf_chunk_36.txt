NCAR GV supported by the NCAR Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL) served as the 
principal source of the observations used in this study. The observational effort included 
characterization of the cloud, precipitation and aerosol fields in the stratocumulus and the 
fair-weather cumulus regimes within the subtropical easterlies over the northern Pacific. 
These characterizations along trajectories were designed to aid in our understanding and
