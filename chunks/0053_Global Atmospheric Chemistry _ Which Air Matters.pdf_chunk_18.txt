high-resolution models as seen in Fig. 1, but the extent to
which these models represent the key processes shaping the
observed patterns is understudied.
Characterizing atmospheric measurements of this chemi-
cal heterogeneity speciﬁcally for testing models is problem-
atic. Simple direct comparisons of atmospheric rivers, pol-
lution or biomass burning plumes, and other structures in
the troposphere or stratosphere are difﬁcult, even with mod-
