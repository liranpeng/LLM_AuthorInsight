plume approximately ﬁlls a grid cell in the global CTM. The
ﬁnal OPE and fraction of NOx oxidized to HNO3 are tabu-
lated for various environmental conditions in a look-up table
that GEOS-Chem uses to determine locally appropriate emis-
sion factors for ship NOx, O3, and HNO3. These aged plume
emissions are then injected into the global CTM, which
then accounts for the subsequent grid-scale photochemistry
and large-scale advection. Although Gaussian plume mod-
