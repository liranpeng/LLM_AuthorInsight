same approach for nitrogen application on soils, but considers the 
effects of different climate regimes. The new guidelines, which are 
based on a wealth of new scientific literature, proposed much smaller 
emissions from grazing animals, by a factor of 5–7. Our preliminary 
calculations indicate that global soil emissions based on these new 
guidelines may decrease by 20%–25%. Integrating estimates that rely 
on the IPCC methodology with estimates from process-based models
