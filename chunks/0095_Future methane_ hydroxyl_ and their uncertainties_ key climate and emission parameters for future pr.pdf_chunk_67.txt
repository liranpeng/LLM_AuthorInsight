sequences of averaging region choice are discussed further
in Sect. 3.3. Temperature and water vapor perturbations are
restricted to the troposphere in Oslo CTM3, which includes
full stratospheric chemistry, to avoid confounding changes in
stratospheric ozone columns.
Only variables with large sensitivity, large interannual
changes, or both can explain the year-to-year τCH4×OH vari-
ations identiﬁed in Fig. 1. Figure 3 shows the interannual
changes of 5 key variables for 1997–2009. Water vapor,
