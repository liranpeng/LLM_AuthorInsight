Conclusions, speculations, and digressions
I have shown that the STE ﬂuxes of old stratospheric air with
“depleted” CO2 have little inﬂuence on the IAV or annual
cycles of CO2 at the surface. The IAV observed for SH sta-
tions has a standard deviation of 0.22 to 0.28 ppm, while that
for sCO2 is at most 0.02 ppm in both hemispheres, that for
eCO2 is less than 0.02 ppm for SPO to SMO, and that for
scaled N2O is 0.03 ppm for SPO+CGO average. The stan-
