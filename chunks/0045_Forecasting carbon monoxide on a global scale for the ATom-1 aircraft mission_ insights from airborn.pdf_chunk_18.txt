liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe detector. A separate laser
and detector are used to measure methane and nitrous
oxide in the same cell. In-ﬂight calibrations were conducted
with gases traceable to the NOAA WMO (X2014) scale,
with calibration of tanks before ATom-1 and after ATom-2
(February 2017) showing no signiﬁcant change in the
CO concentration in the gas standards. The inlet for the
