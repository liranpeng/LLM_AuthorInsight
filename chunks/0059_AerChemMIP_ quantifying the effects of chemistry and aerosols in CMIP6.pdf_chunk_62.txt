of interactive aerosols, tropospheric chemistry and strato-
spheric chemistry. Ideally participating models will include
all three components; however, we realise that this may not
always be possible or practical. Many CMIP models in-
clude emission-driven interactive aerosol schemes, but with
limited or no further tropospheric chemistry. To understand
their overall behaviour we encourage such models to par-
ticipate in those AerChemMIP experiments that are relevant
