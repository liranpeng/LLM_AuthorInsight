levels at a T42 resolution for the analysis.
The performance of the various members included in the model
ensemble has been validated by comparing the present day global
distribution and seasonality of tropospheric O3 against the clima-
tology assembled from ozonesonde measurements for the 1990’s
(Logan, 1999), as shown in Hodnebrog et al. (2011). This provides
some conﬁdence that the ensemble captures both the seasonal and
latitudinal variability in the distribution of tropospheric O3 when
