The effect of changes in chemistry and climate com-
bined
Global mean net radiative forcing values for the difference
“2 minus 1” (or “2 minus 1d”) are listed in Table 6. Glob-
ally and annually averaged, the radiative forcing ranges from
0.27 Wm−2 to 0.46 Wm−2.
If only the three CCMs with
detailed tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry are taken
into account the range is rather narrow, between 0.27 and
