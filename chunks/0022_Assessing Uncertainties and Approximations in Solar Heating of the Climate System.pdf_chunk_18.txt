different climate regimes for the current reference period as they are comparable to the changes in climate 
forcing by greenhouse gases from pre-industrial to present (Myhre et al., 2013). Such shifts are likely to force 
parametric retuning of other ESM processes to match observed surface temperatures. Either way, errors on 
this scale are important and must eventually be addressed.
