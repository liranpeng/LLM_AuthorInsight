mensionally split approach. This is similar to splitting for Eu-
lerian ﬂuxes. However, the dimensional splitting is not along
coordinate axes but along Lagrangian translations of coordi-
nate axes. Hence we refer to this approach as ﬂow-dependent
dimensional splitting. The upstream area is then effectively
approximated using line segments that are parallel to the co-
ordinate axes (see, for example, Fig. 2 in Lauritzen et al.,
2006) so that the two-dimensional remapping problem is cast
