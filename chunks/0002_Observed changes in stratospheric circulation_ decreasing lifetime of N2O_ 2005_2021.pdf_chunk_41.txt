such as CFC-12.
Viewing the changing BDC in terms of lifetimes gives a
different perspective of the potential consequences of climate
change. If this rate of change continues over the 21st cen-
tury, then the lifetimes of N2O and CFC-12 might drop by
20 %. Thus CFCs will be cleared out of the atmosphere ear-
lier than currently projected (e.g., Butchart and Scaife, 2001).
The climate impact of N2O emissions will drop because their
decay time will fall from 110 to 90 years. Note that the de-
