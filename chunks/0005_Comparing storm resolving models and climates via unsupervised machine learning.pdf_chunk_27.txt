differences compared to the other ones (Fig. 3 g, j vs. all). SAM reveals a differently-shaped deep convection cluster 
(Fig. 3j, red regime). SPCAM shows an unusual deep convection cluster adjacent to the marine shallow (blue) 
mode. A closer inspection of the

w′w′ profile shows a unique regime of continental convection with a short 
horizontal scale of variability for SPCAM, particularly near the surface of the Earth (Fig. S9b, red line vs. all). 
For SAM, the
