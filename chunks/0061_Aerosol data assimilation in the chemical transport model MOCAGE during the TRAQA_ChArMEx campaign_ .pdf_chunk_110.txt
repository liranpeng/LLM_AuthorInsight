within the plume. If satellite measurements are accurate, con-
centrations at one height after an assimilation cycle can only
closely correspond to measured ones if the shape of the ver-
tical proﬁle is well simulated in the direct model run. To fur-
ther explore this, in the following subsection we compare the
modelled and the measured vertical proﬁles.
