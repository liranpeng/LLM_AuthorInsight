it learns from a high-fidelity parameterization that resolves
convection based on the high-fidelity dataset and (2) general-
izes beyond the high-fidelity training data regime thanks to
the informative low-fidelity simulations covering regimes at
higher sea surface temperatures. It is worth noting that the
SF-HF-RPN is capable of improving upon the deterministic
NN for nearly all vertical levels and even for determinstic
error metrics (figure 2.a), showing the benefits of using RPNs
