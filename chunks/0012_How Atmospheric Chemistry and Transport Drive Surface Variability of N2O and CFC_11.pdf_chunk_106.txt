with minimum F11X loss. Because F11 is destroyed much lower in the stratosphere than N2O, this pattern 
indicates that the enhanced tropical upwelling in the two regions is disconnected and starts in the lower 
stratosphere. There are other periods when the F11X and N2OX losses are uncorrelated, but the 2010/11 
period is unique in that both models show the same pattern. In sharp contrast, the 2015/16 QBO anomaly in
