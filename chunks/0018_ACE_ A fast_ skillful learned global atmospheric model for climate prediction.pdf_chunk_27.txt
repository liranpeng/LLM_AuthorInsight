has impressively small precipitation biases, with a global RMSE about 42% smaller than the baseline.
The time-mean biases and RMSEs are shown for all output channels in Appendix E. 41 out of 44
output variables have a lower time-mean RMSE for ACE compared to the baseline (Figure 7).
Physical consistency
Many aspects of physical consistency are important for interpretability in
climate model simulations. Here we discuss one example, the conservation of water expressed in
