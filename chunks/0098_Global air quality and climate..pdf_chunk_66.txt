matter, where the anthropogenic species provides greater sur-
face area for condensation and enables additional chemical
interactions.136–139 As recently reviewed,140 the formation
mechanisms of SOA can be aﬀected by interactions with
anthropogenic pollution in multiple ways, including (1) the
partitioning processes to transfer gas-phase biogenic VOC to
the particulate phase, (2) the role of NOx through nitrate-
initiated reactions or changing yields depending on NOx
