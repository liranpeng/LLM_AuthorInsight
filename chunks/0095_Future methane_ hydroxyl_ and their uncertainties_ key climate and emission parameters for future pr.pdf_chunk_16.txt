University of Oslo CTM3, University of California, Irvine
(UCI) CTM, and GEOS-Chem. All of these models are
driven by assimilated meteorological data and conﬁgured to
use the same emissions from anthropogenic, biogenic and
biomass burning sources. We use year-speciﬁc meteorol-
ogy spanning 1997–2009 for each model, except GEOS-
Chem simulations with GEOS-5 meteorology, which are
only 2004–2009. Sections 2.1–2.3 and Table S1 summarize
features of each model and Sect. 2.4 describes the emissions.
