waves. CLAW used here is formally second-order accurate.
A TVD monotonized central-difference limiter (LeVeque,
2002; van Leer, 1977) is used for shape preservation, but
other TVD type ﬂux limiters can also be applied.
Clawpack supports the advective and ﬂux form of the
transport equation. The version of CLAW used here is based
on the advective form. For non-divergent winds the average
normal velocity at mesh cell edges is obtained by differenc-
