the occurrence of thick cumulus. When run at lower resolu-
tion, both averages ﬁnd less clear sky, while the QCA statis-
tics are not affected by resolution in the range 50–200 km.
This averaging, of either J values or clouds, explains why
most models do not produce a single, sharp peak at rlnJ = 0.
At sufﬁciently high model resolution, where CF is either
0 or 1, a new problem arises because the radiative transfer
problem is now clearly 3-D. The 1-D radiative transfer used
