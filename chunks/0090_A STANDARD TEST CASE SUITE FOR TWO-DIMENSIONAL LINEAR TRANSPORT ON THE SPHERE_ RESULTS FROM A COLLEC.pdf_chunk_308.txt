deﬁne a linear reconstruction of ρ and φ in each control vol-
ume:
ρk(r) = ρ + ∇kρ · (r −rk),
(A15)
φk(r) = φ + ∇kφ · (r −rk),
(A16)
respectively, where rk is the centroid of the kth control vol-
ume. Indeed the area average of a quantity coincides with the
value of that quantity at the centroid of the control volume,
with second-order accuracy in space. As a consequence
φ ≃ρφ
ρ
with the same accuracy.
