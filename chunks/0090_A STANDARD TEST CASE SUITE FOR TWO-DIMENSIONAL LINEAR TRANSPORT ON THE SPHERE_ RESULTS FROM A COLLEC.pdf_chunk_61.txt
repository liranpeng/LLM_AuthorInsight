dral Nonhydrostatic Model (ICON); ICON is currently be-
ing developed in a joint effort by the Max Planck Institute
for Meteorology (MPI-M) and the German Weather Service
(DWD). The scheme is referred to as ICON-FFSL (Flux-
Form Semi-Lagrangian). The swept area approximation in
ICON-FFSL is ﬁrst-order in space and second-order in time.
The simpliﬁed ﬂux integration, as used in SFF-CSLAM, is
also applied in ICON-FFSL. Hence the maximum stable CN
