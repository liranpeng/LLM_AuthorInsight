before, and it is adapted for operational purposes since the
data from the past are readily available. The third approach
is to calculate diagnostics from an ensemble of runs with per-
turbed emissions with homogeneous or heterogeneous corre-
lation length scales. The main conclusion is that all methods
signiﬁcantly improve the modelled ﬁeld, and that relative dif-
ferences between different methods are small compared to
the rate of improvement by assimilation. For aerosols, the
