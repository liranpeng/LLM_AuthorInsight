of mid-latitude storm tracks and subtropical high pressure
systems as well as convection (e.g., ref. 6, 7 and 337). Improved
understanding of the spatially resolved global climate response
as compared with the regional climate response to locally
changing O3 and aerosols from speciﬁc emission control
strategies (including eﬀects on the hydrologic cycle, tempera-
ture and circulation) is needed, particularly for the NTCFs in
order to bypass current limitations in the global RF metric.
