mean pressure of the grid cell. The model may need to main-
tain separate storage for the hourly T and q used in the CCM
dynamics because it is important to maintain the clouds as
they would be done in the C-run, and thus the main-code val-
ues of T and q cannot be overwritten with ATom values. The
A-run treatment of stratospheric O3 (i.e., Ô¨Åxed) is unlikely to
be identical to the C-run, but it does not appear to drive ma-
jor changes in the average photolysis rates over a region (see
below).
