rate of CO2 emissions reduction via an approach that is trans-
parent to non-scientists. We consider potential drawdown
of atmospheric CO2 by reforestation and afforestation, the
potential for improved agricultural practices to store more
soil carbon, and potential reductions of non-CO2 GHGs that
could reduce human-made climate forcing.2 Quantitative ex-
amination reveals the merits of these actions to partly offset
demands on fossil fuel CO2 emission phasedown, but also
