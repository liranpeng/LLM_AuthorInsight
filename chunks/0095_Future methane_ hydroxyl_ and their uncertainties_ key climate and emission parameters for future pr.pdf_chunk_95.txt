Historical (1980–2005) changes in CH4 lifetime
Having established the ability of Eq. (3) to reconstruct
τCH4×OH over 1997–2009 in CTMs, we now use it to ex-
trapolate methane lifetime over several decades for which the
CTMs have not been run. We begin with the historical period
1980–2005, during which time the key atmospheric forcing
variables have been relatively well observed by satellites and
ground stations.
In addition to the 5 climate and emission variables iden-
