leaching and groundwater were overestimated in previous studies85. 
Correspondingly, projections of atmospheric N2O concentrations that 
are based on these overestimated emissions82 led to biased estimates. 
For example, in ref. 82, atmospheric N2O concentrations were expected 
to be 340â€“350 ppb in the year 2020, instead of 333 ppb5 as observed. 
The 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Green-
