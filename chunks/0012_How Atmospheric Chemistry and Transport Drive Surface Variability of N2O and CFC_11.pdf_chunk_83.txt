N2O- and CFCl3-depleted air into the troposphere and down to the surface. The overturning circulation, 
including the stratosphere-to-troposphere flux, has a large seasonal cycle driven by solar heating, but also 
well-known interannual variability associated with dynamics like the tropical QBO and wintertime sudden 
stratospheric warmings.
The surface signal in these model calculations should be uniquely stratospheric since we included no trop-
