the annually averaged global-mean radiative forcing due to
changes in stratospheric ozone is negative in all models,
varying from −0.019 to Wm−2 to −0.126 Wm−2 among the
four models that have done scenario 1 including changes in
stratospheric chemistry (see Table 6). The isolated effect of
climate change is to reduce the radiative forcing due to strato-
spheric ozone change. The reason for this is the vertical dis-
tribution of ozone change brought about by climate change
