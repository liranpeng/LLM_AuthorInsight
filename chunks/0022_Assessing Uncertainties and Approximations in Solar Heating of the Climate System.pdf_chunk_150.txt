use vertical decorrelation lengths in its MAX-COR algorithm (M. J. Prather, 2015). Chemistry models need 
the selection of ICAs for any overlap method to be deterministic because many critical applications require 
perturbation-control pairs without stochastic noise (e.g., M. J. Prather & Hsu, 2010). Thus Solar-J cannot
