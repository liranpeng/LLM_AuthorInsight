Fig. 1. Spatial distribution of the absolute difference in NOx emission ﬂux for the SRES A1B scenario (units: 1013 molecules NO2 m−2 s−1
for AIRCRAFT and SHIP; 1014 molecules NO2 m−2 s−1 for ROAD).
while 2002 was used for spin-up. For each model and each
of the years 2025 and 2050, four simulations were carried
out using emissions from the A1B scenario – a reference run
(BASE), and perturbation runs for each of the three transport
sectors AIR, SHIP, and ROAD. The reference simulation in-
