One further limitation of this study is that the CO-tracer
data were not archived at a higher temporal resolution than
monthly. Hence, it is not possible to examine how CO-tracer
concentrations in the mid-latitudes are inï¬‚uenced by changes
in synoptic-scale storm or blocking frequency. Our ability
to look further into relationships between the mid-latitude
storm tracks and CO-tracer distributions over middle and
high latitudes is also limited by the fact that only zonally av-
