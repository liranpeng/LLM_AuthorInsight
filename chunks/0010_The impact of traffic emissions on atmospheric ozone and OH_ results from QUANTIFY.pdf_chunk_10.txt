els (Hedegaard et al., 2008). The impact of air trafﬁc emis-
sions has been subject of various investigations (e.g. Hidalgo
and Crutzen, 1977; Schumann, 1997; Brasseur et al., 1996;
Schumann et al., 2000) also assessing projections for the fu-
ture (e.g. Sovde et al., 2007; Grewe et al., 2007). For the
present day atmosphere these studies indicated an increase
of ozone of 3–6% due to aircraft emissions in the region of
