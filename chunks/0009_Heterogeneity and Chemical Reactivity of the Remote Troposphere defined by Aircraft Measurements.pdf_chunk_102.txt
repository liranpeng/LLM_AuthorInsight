agreement indicates that both models and ATom ﬁnd the in-
ﬂuence of deep continental convection bringing reactive NOx
+ HOx air masses to the nearby oceanic regions but not to the
central Paciﬁc. The difference below 5 km in all three regions
implies a consistent bias across the models in some combi-
nation of HOx sources and/or the vertical redistribution of
lightning NOx. This difference is unlikely to be a sampling
bias in ATom-1, given it occurs in all three regions.
