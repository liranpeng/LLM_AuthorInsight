These correspond to radiative forcing changes between the PERT_H2 and CTRL
and scaled PERT_CH4 and CTRL experiments respectively.
For uncertainty calculation, we expand the equation in more detail and rewrite
the ﬂux changes as burden changes divided by hydrogen lifetime:

Δ denotes changes between the control and perturbed experiments where
changes in between PERT_CH4 and CTRL have been scaled to match the expected
