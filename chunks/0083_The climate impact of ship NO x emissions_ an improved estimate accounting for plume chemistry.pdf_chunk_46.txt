our use of O3 radiative efﬁciencies that were derived in mod-
els with instant dilution. O3 column enhancements in the
ﬁxed OPE simulation are qualitatively different and concen-
trated mainly in the high northern latitudes, because OPE is
not suppressed in winter or by high NOx emissions in this
scenario. As Table 2 reports, the global-mean O3 column
change for a 1 Tg(N) yr−1 increase in ship NOx is 0.10 DU
in the parametric plume model, compared to 0.16 DU under
