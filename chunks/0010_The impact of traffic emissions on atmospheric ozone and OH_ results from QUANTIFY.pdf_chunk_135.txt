Fig. 11. Correlations between 1OH and 1NOx for road trafﬁc (upper row) and ship trafﬁc (lower row) for January (left) and July (right).
All coloured points are for low NOx conditions coded by latitudes: (sub-)tropics (red), northern hemisphere (blue > 30◦N) and southern
hemisphere (green, < 30◦S). The effect of ship emissions is shown at 950 hPa over the oceans and of road emissions over land up to 850 hPa.
Eyring et al. (2007) of 3.1 TgN/yr are lower compared to the
