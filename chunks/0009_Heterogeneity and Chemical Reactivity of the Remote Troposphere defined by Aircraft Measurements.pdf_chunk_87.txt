ical ATom reactivities is shown in comparisons with proba-
bility densities below (Fig. 5).
How important is it for the models to represent the ex-
tremes of reactivity? While the sorted reactivity curves
(Fig. 1, Tables 2 and S8) continue to steepen from the 90th
to 97th percentile, the slope does not change that much. Thus
we can estimate the 99th + percentile contributes < 5 % of
the total reactivity. Thus, if our model misses the top 1 % of
