K and calculate its Pearson correlation ­coefficient67 with the table of KL divergences at K + 1 . This process yields 
15 unique Pearson correlation coefficients, which are then averaged. The summarized outcomes are presented 
in Fig. 8.
The analysis reveals that the VAE approach exhibits the highest level of robustness for an approximation of 
the true KL Divergence, showing a rapid convergence towards a correlation coefficient of nearly 1 as K increases.
