individual grid cells with fractional, overlapping cloud lay-
ers. Although 3-D RT models can be used to solve for the
average heating and photolysis rates, most climate mod-
els decompose the cloud structures into ICAs, for example,
through cloud-resolving models (Khairoutdinov et al., 2005)
or from cloud fractional coverage and a decorrelation dis-
tance for overlapping cloud layers (Prather, 2015). The ICAs
are horizontally homogeneous and can be solved using the
