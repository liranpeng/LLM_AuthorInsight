TC values), and on the consequent LMS domains (compare three LS values). The diﬀerences between TC
and LS methods reﬂect ﬂuxes in the tropics where the LMS domains typically do not reach to the equator.
For the TC method, the 120 ppb or 250 ppb O3 isosurfaces reach above the true tropical tropopause (see
Prather et al. [2011] and Considine et al. [2008]) or here the e90-tropopause, and thus, the O3 production from
