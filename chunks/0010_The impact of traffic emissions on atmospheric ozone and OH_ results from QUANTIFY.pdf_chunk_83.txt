both January and July, is much smaller than the variations
between the models (â‰ˆ20%). The latter can be explained
by the different convection schemes and grid resolutions,
which introduce large uncertainties to the distribution of
the chemical species (Tost et al., 2006, 2007).
However,
the rather small interannual variability also indicates that
year-to-year changes of meteorology lead to changes in
the horizontal distribution of ozone perturbations and the
