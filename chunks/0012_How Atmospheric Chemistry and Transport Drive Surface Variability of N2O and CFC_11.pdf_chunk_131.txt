the surface across all latitudes. By comparing CFCl3 (F11) and N2O simulations, we find that the surface 
variability is driven almost entirely by dynamical variations in cross tropopause fluxes of air rather than by 
propagation of the variability in stratospheric loss.
At the surface, we are able to quantify the QBO fingerprint in N2O, showing that, for the most part, the 
three models match the observed interannual variations in N2O in both hemispheres despite the presence
