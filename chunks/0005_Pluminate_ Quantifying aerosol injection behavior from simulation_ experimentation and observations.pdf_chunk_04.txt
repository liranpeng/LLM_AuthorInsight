in 2D, however, 3D compatible data is more scarce, and necessary
for the development of subgrid scale parameterizations of aerosol-
cloud interactions in GCMs. This report introduces two novel
parameterizations of atmospheric aerosol injection behavior suitable
for both 3D (GCM-compatible) and 2D (observation-related)
modeling. Their applicability is highlighted using a wealth of different
observational data: small and larger scale salt-aerosol injection
