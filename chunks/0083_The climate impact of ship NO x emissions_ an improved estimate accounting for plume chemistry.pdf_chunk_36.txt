dence intervals for other factors in Eqs. (2)–(4) are given in
Holmes et al. (2011), with the following updates. Recent data
suggest a smaller feedback factor, f = 1.34 ± 0.06 (Holmes
et al., 2013). We use a ship-speciﬁc radiative efﬁciency for
O3, which is smaller than that of aviation O3 and that of
long-lived O3 changes (cf. Fuglestvedt et al., 2008; Holmes
et al., 2011) because ship O3 is mostly conﬁned to low alti-
tudes and high latitudes (e.g., Hoor et al., 2009). We adopt a
