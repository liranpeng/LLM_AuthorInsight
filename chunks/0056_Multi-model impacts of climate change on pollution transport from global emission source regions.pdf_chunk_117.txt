biomass burning emissions. Biomass burning emissions were
held constant for present day and future in this study.
The higher tropopause reported here is a robust Ô¨Ånding
across climate change studies (e.g. Kang et al., 2013; Val-
lis et al., 2015). The strong increases in CO-tracer concen-
trations in the vicinity of the tropopause can be largely at-
tributed to a higher tropopause under greenhouse gas warm-
ing, whereby this region has low-CO stratospheric air for
