62 mW m−2, again due to the higher O3 enhancement ef-
ﬁciencies (61–87 % higher) used in their study. Estimates
from the multi-model study of Eyring et al. (2007) were
much lower than in this study with O3 RF from SHIP of
14 mW m−2 for 2030, and 9.8 mW m−2 for 2000. Part of the
reason is the magnitude of ship NOx emissions which was
lower in their study, but it can also be related to the differ-
ent geographical emission distribution, whereas the emission
