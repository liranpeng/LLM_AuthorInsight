burden is calculated from monthly-mean, globally-averaged
NOAA marine surface measurements (Dlugokencky, 2022)
and uses the conversion factor of 4.78 TgN ppb−1 (Prather
et al., 2012). Given that the gridding and source ﬁles have
changed since P2015 (which used the 5◦latitude GOZ-
CARDS data), we compared the global monthly loss rates
for the overlap period with P2015 (August 2004–December
2011): the mean difference of 0.2 % and root mean square
