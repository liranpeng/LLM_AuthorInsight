each data set and apply a mask using a cutoff of 0.10 rather
than 0.67 to examine a larger area. In addition, this value of
QPcorresponds to having one station at a distance of 250 km
(i.e., the station is representative of a ∼5◦× 5◦grid cell).
This ﬁgure shows that the AQS interpolation is systemati-
cally lower than the CASTNET one for almost all locations
and percentiles, particularly over California and from the
central plains east to New York City. The bias is least for the
