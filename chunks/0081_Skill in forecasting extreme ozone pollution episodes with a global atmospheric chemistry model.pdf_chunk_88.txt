serious errors beyond the median bias of +17 ppb probably
related to the baseline tropospheric O3. If we had done this
as a climatology comparison, we would have completely re-
versed this diagnosis. We show maps of model bias as cal-
culated using independent and concurrent sampling and their
difference at Ô¨Åve representative percentiles (5th, 25th, 50th,
75th, and 95th) for the US and EU in Figs. S3 and S4 in the
Supplement, respectively. Biases at the 5th percentile calcu-
