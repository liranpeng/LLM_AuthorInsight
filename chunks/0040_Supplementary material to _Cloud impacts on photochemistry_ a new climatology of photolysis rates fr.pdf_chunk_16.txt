dependence on wavelength and incident-angle now in Cloud-J v8, see text.  The fixed albedo is denoted by 'a =' in 
the legend.  These distributions show the relative error in J-values calculated in typical models using a fixed albedo 
instead of the more physically based OSA models (Séférian et al., 2018).  For both cases the reflected sunlight is 
assumed to be isotropic.  The OSA depends on surface wind (sampled uniformly from 1 to 21 m/s) and chlorophyll
