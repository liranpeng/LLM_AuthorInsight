where parcels are traced throughout the simulation, any re-
lation between tracers is maintained, and hence the scatter
points are stationary in the correlation plots.
The way in which scatter points deviate from the poly-
nomial curve has consequences for the physical realizability
of the mixing introduced by the scheme. When mixing oc-
curs in the atmosphere, scatter points (for example, located in
