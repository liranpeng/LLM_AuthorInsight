surface albedo change are estimated from historical scenarios
of emissions and land use. Oscillatory and intermittent natural
forcings (solar irradiance and volcanoes) are excluded. CFCs
include not only chloroﬂuorocarbons, but all Montreal Protocol
trace gases (MPTGs) and other trace gases (OTGs). Uncertainties
(for 5–95 % conﬁdence) are 0.6 W m−2 for total GHG forcing and
0.9 W m−2 for aerosol forcing (Myhre et al., 2013).
