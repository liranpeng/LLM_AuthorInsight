ﬁx greatly reduced O3 production (P-O3) in the lower tro-
posphere. A second NOx problem involved the propagation
of polluted proﬁles from the Los Angeles basin to gap-ﬁlling
over the tropical eastern Paciﬁc. This correction resulted in
the update of the modeling data stream to version 2b. These
NOx errors cause noticeable changes in reactivities, espe-
cially P-O3. Other decision errors led us to decrease the
southern latitude extent of the Atlantic and Paciﬁc transects
