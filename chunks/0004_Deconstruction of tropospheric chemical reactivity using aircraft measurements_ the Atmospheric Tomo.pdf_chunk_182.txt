e.g., biomass burning. There is one example in these proﬁles
where such convection delivers high aerosol loading near
6 km in the eastern Paciﬁc (ATom-4). We calculate the fre-
quency distribution of reactions for all the parcels in ATom-
1 Paciﬁc and Atlantic assuming a high-reactivity coefﬁcient
gamma = 0.10 in Fig. 66. If we are looking for heterogeneous
reactions to compete with radical chemistry rates (e.g., ROO,
