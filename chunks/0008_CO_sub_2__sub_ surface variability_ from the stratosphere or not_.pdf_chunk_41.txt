in Fig. 1d, there are clear times when SMO is distinct from
CGO+SPO (e.g., 1994, 1999, 2008 2012, 2015). At these
times the SMO IAV matches that of MLO (not shown). These
interannual shifts provide an excellent test for CO2 historical
simulations using weather forecasting systems (e.g., McNor-
ton et al., 2020) and realistic sources and sinks (e.g., Piao et
al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020).
