scattering. Here we propose a repeated “aerosol-free” call
invoking this all-sky/clear-sky double call to radiation once
more, by setting the aerosol scattering and absorption prop-
erties to zero. Fluxes for this repeated call have to be stored
separately (top-of-atmosphere radiative upwelling ﬂux com-
ponents with aerosol scattering and absorption set to zero:
shortwave in all sky and clear sky (rsutca, rsutcsca) and cor-
responding longwave (rlutca, and rlutcsca)). To limit com-
