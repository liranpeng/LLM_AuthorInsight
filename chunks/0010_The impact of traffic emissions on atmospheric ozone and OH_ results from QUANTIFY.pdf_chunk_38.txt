Fig. 2. Comparison of the small perturbation approach (5% emission reduction) and later scaling to a total removal of the respective trafÔ¨Åc
emission based on the simulations of p-TOMCAT. The plots indicate the difference of the ozone perturbation from both approaches.
2.1
Small perturbations and scaling
As mentioned above, for this study a small perturbation-
approach was chosen for two main reasons: Since one focus
of the analysis is a direct comparison of the impact of the
