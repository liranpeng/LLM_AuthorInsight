produced in all three models are close to that observed. The
STE ozone ﬂux resolved by month–latitude in O3v2 is no-
tably different from that in the UCI model, but we have no
observations to evaluate the two, except for the global mean
ﬂux where the two models agree. It would be interesting to
run EAM as an ofﬂine CTM driven by reanalysis winds, but
