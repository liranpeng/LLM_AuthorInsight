point and observation sites. The difference is that the weights
in Kriging are formulated to minimize the variance in the es-
timated values (error) using a predeﬁned model of the spatial
covariance of the data, while the weights in IDW are deter-
mined without speciﬁc need for the covariance function.
Kriging is often favored as it provides prediction error es-
timates and incorporates a declustering mechanism designed
to account for data redundancy, effectively treating highly
