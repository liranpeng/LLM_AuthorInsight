few decades.9 We thus refer to these species as ‘‘Near-Term
Climate Forcers’’ (NTCFs). Many studies reviewed here com-
pare climate impacts of diﬀerent NTCFs by estimating radia-
tive forcing (RF). RF is deﬁned by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the change in net radia-
tive ﬂux at the tropopause, after allowing stratospheric
temperatures to adjust (note that other RF estimates allow
other fast time scale adjustments), induced by a change in
