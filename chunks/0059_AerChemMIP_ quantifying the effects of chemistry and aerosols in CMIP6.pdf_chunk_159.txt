the effect of climate change on atmospheric composition,
which happens through both changes in transport and chem-
istry. The availability of stratosphere–troposphere resolving
chemistry–climate model simulations thereby provides the
unique opportunity to look at these chemistry–climate inter-
actions in a more comprehensive way than what was hitherto
possible based on the models contributing to CMIP5. The
DECK Control and 1 % yr−1 CO2 runs will be particularly
