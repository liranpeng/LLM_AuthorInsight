Radiative forcing owing to ozone loss in the lower strato-
sphere has been studied, for example, by Forster (1999),
Kiehl et al. (1999), and Myhre et al. (2001), and is a complex
balance between the negative LW and the positive SW con-
tributions. The IPCC-TAR estimates the net radiative forc-
ing due to stratospheric ozone loss since preindustrial times
at −0.15±0.1 Wm−2. Unlike the tropospheric ozone forcing
