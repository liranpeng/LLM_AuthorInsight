emissions. For the US, a clear pattern of decreasing episode
sizes for successive years in the decade can be seen, con-
sistent with reductions in precursor emissions. For EU, this
pattern is less apparent; however the standout features are the
CCDFs for 2003 and 2006, which have much larger episodes
than other years. The annual number of AQX events and ( Â¯S)
values support this conclusion, as seen in Table 3.
