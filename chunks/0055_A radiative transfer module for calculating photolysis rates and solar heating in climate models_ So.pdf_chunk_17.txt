proach (Mlawer et al., 1997; Clough et al., 2005). A two-
stream model was certainly necessary at a time when the
need for computational efÔ¨Åciency exceeded that for accuracy.
With the rapid advancement of massively parallel comput-
ing, it is time to ask if an upgrade to a higher-order scheme
is needed for improved accuracy in climate modeling, par-
ticularly with regard to cloud and aerosol forcing. The two-
stream scattering approximation has been in use for decades
