model with variable resolution (500, 250 and 30 km) com-
pared to aircraft measurements; see also ship plume chem-
istry in Charlton-Perez et al. (2009). ATom’s 10 s air parcels
measure 2 km (horizontal) by 80 m (vertical) during most
proﬁles. There are obviously some chemical structures below
the 10 s air parcels we use here. Only some ATom measure-
ments are archived at 1 Hz, and we examine a test case using
1 s data for O3 and H2O for a mid-ocean descent between
