drops to 391 ppb (see Fig. S2). Over the 21st century, the
N2O increase drops by 27 % from 103 to 75 ppb, correspond-
ing to a drop in effective radiative forcing of 0.09 W m−2,
equivalent to about 6.6 ppm CO2 (Forster et al., 2021). Such
differences are substantial when trying to tune our mitigation
strategies to achieve climate change goals.
Overall, we will see an accelerated removal of the long-
lived trace gases. Chipperﬁeld et al. (2014) analyzed the
