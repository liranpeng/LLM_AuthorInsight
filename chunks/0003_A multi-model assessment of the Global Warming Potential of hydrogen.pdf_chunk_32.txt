forcing. In all model simulations the aerosol forcing is weak (see
Fig. 3) and for all experiments, it is weaker in magnitude
compared to the change in stratospheric water vapor.
Supplementary Table 3 summarizes the main effects of
increasing hydrogen in the atmosphere normalized by 1 Tg ﬂux
of hydrogen.
Global warming potential. GWP100 for hydrogen is the ratio of
the absolute global warming potential (AGWP100) for hydrogen
relative to that for CO2. AGWP100 is deﬁned as the time-
