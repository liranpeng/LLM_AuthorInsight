returned to their initial position without altering their initial
value. In the test cases presented here, the trajectories are not
exact, and the error norms are therefore non-zero. Note that
this is not the case for HEL since the mixing/diffusion is ir-
reversible.
The scheme uses the same coupling between ï¬‚uid density
and tracer mass as the CSLAM scheme, although the nudg-
ing of Eulerian cell averages is done separately for density
and mass, but constrained by monotonicity in tracer mixing
