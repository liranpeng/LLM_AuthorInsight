conﬁrm this assumption. This demonstrates that the contin-
uous assimilation of good-quality AOD observations and/or
model propagation of the increment can correct a shape of
the aerosol vertical proﬁle, although a single AOD assimila-
tion cycle can only expand or shrink the proﬁle shape (as the
AOD observations do not contain the information on the ver-
tical). For the proﬁle in Fig. 9c, by comparing the forecast
and the analysis of the same assimilation window, we see
