NN. and SF-HF-RPN models, while the MF-RPN improves even further upon the LF-RPN model. Comparing the deterministic
NN. and SF-HF-RPN results, the latter is capable of better resolving the moisture convection stochasticity within the tropics for
low vertical levels (761 hPa as seen in figure 7.f), while it fails to do so for higher levels (259 and 494 hPa as seen in figures 7.d
and 7.e).
