measurements we set out to make have been made. For some
key quantities, such as the mean mesoscale vertical mo-
tion ﬁeld, preliminary analyses (e.g., Fig. 9) suggest that the
measurements sampled substantial variability, which bodes
well for testing the hypothesized link between cloudiness
and cloud-based mass ﬂuxes. The analysis of other measure-
ments, such as those that aim to quantify clouds, is more del-
icate and ongoing. We anticipate that each step of the sub-
