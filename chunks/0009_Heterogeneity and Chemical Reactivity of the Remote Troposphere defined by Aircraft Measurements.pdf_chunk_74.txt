model spread of the central models as discussed above. When
evaluating the model’s climatology for chemical species, we
use MDS-2. A summary of the key data ﬁles used here, as
well as their sources and contents, is given in Table 4.

Probability densities of the reactivities
The reactivities for three large domains (global, Paciﬁc, At-
lantic) from the six-model RDS-0 are summarized in Tables 2
and S8. Sorted PDs for the three Rs and Paciﬁc and Atlantic
