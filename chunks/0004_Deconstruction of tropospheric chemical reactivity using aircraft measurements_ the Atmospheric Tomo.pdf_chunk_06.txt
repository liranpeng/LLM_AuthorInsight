orologically variable and hence deployment-speciﬁc hotspots of photochemical activity. Added calculations of
the sensitivities of the production and loss terms relative to each species emphasize the few dominant species
that control the ozone and methane budgets and whose statistical patterns should be key model–measurement
metrics. From the sensitivities, we also derive linearized lifetimes of ozone and methane on a parcel-by-parcel
