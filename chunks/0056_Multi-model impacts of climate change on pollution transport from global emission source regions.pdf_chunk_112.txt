changes in annual-mean CO-tracer mixing ratios at the sur-
face and in the free troposphere are of similar magnitude to
those reported by Fang et al. (2011) using the GFDL AM3
model. Somewhat larger decreases in tropospheric-average
idealised tracer mixing ratios of 25 % were reported in 2100
by Holzer and Boer (2001) under a different climate change
scenario.
In addition, all four CCMs simulate a small region of in-
crease in zonal-mean surface CO-tracer mixing ratios at ∼5–
