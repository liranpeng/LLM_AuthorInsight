VOC (e.g., methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and methylbutenol).
These emissions contribute approximately two-thirds of the
non-methane VOC budget at the regional and global scale48
and the terpenoid compounds (isoprene and monoterpenes)
are typically more reactive than many anthropogenic VOC.49
BVOC oxidation can contribute to O3 formation when NOx is
present.50,51 BVOC also alter global oxidant levels and thereby
impact CH4 abundances.52 The magnitude and sign of the
