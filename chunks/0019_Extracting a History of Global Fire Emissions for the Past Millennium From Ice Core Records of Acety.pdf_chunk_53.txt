sate for the elevated reactivity of the model, the OH reaction coefﬁcients for acetylene and ethane were
reduced by 25% (see supporting information, SI).
Simulations were conducted for a 3‐year period using meteorological ﬁelds from 2005–2007 and the ﬁnal
year (2007) was used to calculate annual average air mass weighted acetylene and ethane mole fractions.
Sensitivities for acetylene and ethane over Greenland and Antarctica were calculated as follows:
Sensitivity ¼ abundance over polar region
