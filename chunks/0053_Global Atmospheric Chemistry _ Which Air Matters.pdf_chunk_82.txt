with latitude boundaries at 60–40◦S, 40–20◦S, 20◦S–0◦, 0–
20◦N, 20–40◦N, and 40–60◦N (each region is color keyed
in Fig. 3); longitude, in a single broad domain, 150–210◦E.
Vertical proﬁles (200–1000 hPa) on the models’ native grid
are shown for the six domains as different colors. The stan-
dard C-runs with all transport and emissions included are
solid lines, while the ATom-like A-runs are dashed.
For L-CH4, the only general agreement is the lesser im-
