The modeling data stream (MDS)
The ATom mission was designed to collect a multi-species,
detailed chemical climatology that documents the spatial pat-
terns of chemical heterogeneity throughout the remote tropo-
sphere. Figure S1 in the Supplement maps the 48 research
ﬂights, and the Supplement has tables summarizing each
ﬂight. We required a complete set of key species in each
air parcel to initialize the models that calculate the CH4 and
