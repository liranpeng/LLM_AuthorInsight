face ozone shows a similar zonal and temporal distribution
as for road.
Globally the effect of ship emissions on ozone in the
boundary layer is larger than those from road emissions,
whereas both are almost equal in the upper troposphere (Ta-
ble 5). Notably in the upper troposphere aircraft emissions
do not dominate the annual mean global effect between 200–
300 hPa. Their inﬂuence is rather concentrated to latitudes
poleward of 30◦N (see Fig. 6) whereas road and ship trafﬁc
