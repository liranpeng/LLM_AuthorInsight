as observed above for the moisture tendency at level 494 hPa.
For other levels and for heat tendency, the MF-RPN model
shows even higher R2 values in the south Atlantic ocean and
African Sahara. We also provide the temporal variation of the
MAE and R2 metrics in Supplementary Information.
For both tendencies and nearly all vertical levels, the MF-
RPN model shows improved results compared to all other
surrogate models including for the tropics across all vertical
