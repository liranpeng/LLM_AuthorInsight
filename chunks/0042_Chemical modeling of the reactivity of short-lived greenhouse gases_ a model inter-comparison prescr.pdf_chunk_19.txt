a 1/2◦-resolution model to generate the data stream. Section 3
presents and compares the statistics of P -O3, L-O3, and L-
CH4 and J-values from the 14 880 parcels, including ﬁve dif-
ferent days in August to sample variability in cloud systems.
Sorted distributions show the models’ agreement on the most
highly reactive parcels. The ﬁnal discussion in Sect. 4 con-
siders the role of inherent uncertainty in modeling parcel re-
activity, of basic differences in the models, and whether the
