ages energy efÔ¨Åciency and carbon-free energies.
In addition to CO2 emission phase-out, large CO2 extrac-
tion from the air is needed and a halt of growth of non-CO2
climate forcings to achieve the temperature stabilization of
our scenarios. Success of both CO2 extraction and non-CO2
GHG controls requires a major role for developing coun-
tries, given that they have been a large source of recent de-
forestation (IPCC, 2013) and have a large potential for re-
