a clear layer when the FCA has been averaged over several
hours or taken from a parameterized cloud-resolving model.
It our tests, using meteorological data with NL = 36, the
maximum number of G0 ICAs was 375. Model G3 has at
most three MAX-RAN groups demarcated by atmospheric
regimes: a Ô¨Åxed altitude (1.5 km, stratus top) and tempera-
ture (the liquid-to-ice cloud transition). The maximum pos-
sible number of ICAs per FCA for G3 is 103, and in our tests
we found 288.
