accurate climate projections without requiring major increase in computational resources. Our multi-fidelity randomized prior
networks (MF-RPNs) combine physical parameterization data as low-fidelity and storm-resolving historical runâ€™s data as
high-fidelity. To extrapolate beyond the training data, the MF-RPNs are tested on high-fidelity warming scenarios, +4K, data.
