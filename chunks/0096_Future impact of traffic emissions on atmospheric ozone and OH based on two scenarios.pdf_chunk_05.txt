A1B than the B1 scenario.
As a response to expected changes in emissions, AIR and
SHIP will have increased impacts on atmospheric O3 and
OH in the future while the impact of ROAD trafﬁc will
decrease substantially as a result of technological improve-
ments. In 2050, maximum aircraft-induced O3 occurs near
80◦N in the UTLS region and could reach 9 ppbv in the zonal
mean during summer. Emissions from ship trafﬁc have their
largest O3 impact in the maritime boundary layer with a max-
