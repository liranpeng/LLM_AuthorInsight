a Calculated by removing all ship NOx emissions.
b Derived from reported O3 burden and RF.
c Calculated for 5 % perturbation to year 2000 ship NOx emissions.
d Average of models used by Hoor et al. (2009) and Myhre et al. (2011).
dlnτtotal/dE is the accompanying change in total at-
mospheric CH4 lifetime, dF/d[O3] and dF/d[CH4] are
the radiative efﬁciencies of tropospheric O3 and CH4,
