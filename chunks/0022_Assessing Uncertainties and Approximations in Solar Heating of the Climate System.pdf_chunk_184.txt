Here, we make recommendations based on the magnitude of error and the difficulty or extra computational 
cost in improving the models. The levels of ranking include 0 (inconsequential errors), 1 (modest errors and 
easy/cost-effective fix, or significant errors but hard to fix), 2 (significant errors and ready/cost-effective fix).
