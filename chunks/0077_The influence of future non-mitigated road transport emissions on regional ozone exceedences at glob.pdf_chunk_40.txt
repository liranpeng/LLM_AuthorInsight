mid-latitudes during the winter, thus accumulating the additional
O3 near the surface.
For East China, which exhibits the highest NOx emissions in 2025
(c.f. Fig. 2), near-surface O3 levels increase bya few ppb during boreal
wintertime and by w10 ppb during boreal summertime. These in-
creases in O3 persist throughout the timeline, in spite of the pro-
jected decreases in cumulative anthropogenic NOx emissions
between 2025 and 2050. For the ME/Turkey, whose projected
