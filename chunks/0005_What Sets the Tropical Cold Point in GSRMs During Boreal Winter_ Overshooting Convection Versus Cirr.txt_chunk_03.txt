mechanisms that may influence the cold point—cold point‐overshooting convection and the radiative lofting of thin cirrus near the cold point—during boreal winter by comparing 30‐day global storm‐resolving model (GSRM) simulations from the winter phase of the DYAMOND initiative to satellite observations. GSRMs have explicit deep convection and sufficiently fine grid spacings to simulate convective overshoots and UTLS cirrus, making them promising tools for this purpose. We find that the GSRMs
