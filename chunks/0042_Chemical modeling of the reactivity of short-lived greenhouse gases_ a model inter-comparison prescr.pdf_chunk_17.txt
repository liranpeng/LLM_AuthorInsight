Here and in P2017, we approximate the reactivity of an air
parcel by running our global chemistry models with their
regular meteorology and chemical modules, but with trans-
port and mixing of tracers shut down to keep the grid cells
isolated. Effectively, we are able to use the standard full 3-
D model as a collection of box models (i.e., one per grid
cell), while incorporating its diurnal cycle of photolysis and
cloud Ô¨Åelds. Such simulations, named the A-runs, are arti-
