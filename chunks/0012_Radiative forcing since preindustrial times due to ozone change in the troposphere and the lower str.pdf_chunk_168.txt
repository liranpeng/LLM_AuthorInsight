centrations compared to surface observations from the late
1800s. Results from a “tuned” version of the model, in which
lightning NOx emissions have been reduced and biogenic
hydrocarbon emissions have been increased, better matches
the surface ozone observations available from the end of the
19th century. For more details see Mickley et al. (1999) and
Mickley et al. (2001). The Harvard-GISS radiative transfer
model employs the correlated k-distribution method to de-
