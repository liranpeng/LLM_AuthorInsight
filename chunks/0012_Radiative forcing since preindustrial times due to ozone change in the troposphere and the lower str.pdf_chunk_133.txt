Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The tropopause level is based
on NCEP reanalysis data for the year 2000 and is the same
for all radiative forcing calculations in order to allow a con-
venient standardization between models.
3.1.1
The effect of changes in chemistry
Figure 6 shows maps of annual-mean radiative forcing due
to changes in tropospheric ozone between 1850 and 2000,
when only changes in chemistry are taken into account. Dif-
ferences can be seen in the magnitude of the forcing, whereas
