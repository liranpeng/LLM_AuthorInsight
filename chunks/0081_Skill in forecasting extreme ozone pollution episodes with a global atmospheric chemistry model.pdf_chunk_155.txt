high-pollution events. When used to test a chemistry–climate
model, more caution is needed.
AQX events are deﬁned here in terms of the return time of
such events for each cell (i.e., as in climate extremes) rather
than as an absolute O3 threshold. Such deﬁnition clearly
identiﬁes large-scale pollution episodes associated with stag-
nant meteorological regimes. The AQX events (10 worst
days per year = 97.3 percentile) contain a disproportionately
