not the equivalent isotropic properties.
In addition to these ICA approximations, we also com-
pare the G6/.33 exact sum over ICAs with three simple cloud
models often used in chemistry models that do not generate
ICAs: clear sky (ClSky); averaged cloud over each layer (Av-
Cld); and cloud fraction to the 3/2(f 3/2, CF3/2).
A sample of mean and rms errors for the seven approxi-
mate methods is given in Table 1. In addition, a tropospheric
