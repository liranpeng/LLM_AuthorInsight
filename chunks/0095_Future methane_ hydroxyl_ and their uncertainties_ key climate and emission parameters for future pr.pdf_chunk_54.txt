ity, but they differ in sign and magnitude of the anomaly at
many times. These differences in observed MCF decay rates
between the two networks are as large as the discrepancy be-
tween CTM τCH4×OH anomalies and either set of observa-
tions. Therefore, we conclude that better understanding of
systematic differences between the observation networks is
required before MCF can be used to constrain τCH4×OH and
OH anomalies in speciﬁc years at the precision required (1-
