Opportunities and lessons learned
As a quick look at the opportunities provided by the ATom
data, we present an example based on the Wolfe et al. (2019)
study, which used the F0AM model and semi-analytical argu-
ments to show that troposphere HCHO columns (measurable
by satellite and ATom) are related to OH columns (measured
by ATom) and thus to CH4 loss. Figure 6 extends the Wolfe et
al. (2019) study using the individual air parcels and plotting
