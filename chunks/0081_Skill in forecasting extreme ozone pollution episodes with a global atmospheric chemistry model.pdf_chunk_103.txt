and also the largest in the CTM hindcast, at 1700 × 104 km2-
days (104 km2 is our basic areal unit since our grid resolution
is 1◦). The skill of the CTM on these 6 days was 75.4 %, with
both data sets showing the episode’s structure and trajectory.
These extreme events are connected in space–time and can
be reproduced in a hindcast by a global model. These at-
tributes provide an opportunity to develop a climatology of
extreme ozone episodes (e.g., areal extent, duration, inten-
