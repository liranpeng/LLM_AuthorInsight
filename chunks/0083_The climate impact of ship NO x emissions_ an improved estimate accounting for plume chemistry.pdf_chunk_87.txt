Conclusions
The non-linear chemistry governing O3 and OH produc-
tion in emission plumes has been recognized for decades.
In spite of this knowledge, global modeling studies of ship
NOx emissions and their impacts on climate and air quality
are usually made under the assumption that emissions are in-
