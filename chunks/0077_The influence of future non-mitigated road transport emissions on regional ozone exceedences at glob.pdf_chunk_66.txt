which exceedences occur is rather small in relative terms, analysing
the trends in NOx emissions between the different transport sectors
shows that unmitigated RTE does have the potential to offset any
improvements in air quality that would occur over the land due to a
reduction in shipping emissions. Even for 2050 a wide area near the
Persian Gulf remains polluted. Considering the rather small NTS
contribution for the region (c.f. Fig. 2) any improvement in air
