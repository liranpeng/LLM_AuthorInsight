T is temperature and was perturbed only 1 %. Q is H2O and was perturbed 10 % like all the
chemical species. The diagonal elements are the average (Paciﬁc and Atlantic) ﬁrst-order
sensitivities S(+dX) (see Table 2). The upper-triangular (Paciﬁc) and lower-triangular (Atlantic)
matrices show the second-order sensitivities SXY = S(+dX+dY) −S(+dX) −S(+dY).
