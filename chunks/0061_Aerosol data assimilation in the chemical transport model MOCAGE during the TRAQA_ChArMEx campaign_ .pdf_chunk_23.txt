diffusion is implemented following Louis (1979), and con-
vection is implemented following Bechtold et al. (2001). The
dynamics within the CTM are forced by meteorological anal-
ysis ﬁelds (pressure, winds, temperature, speciﬁc humidity)
from ARPEGE, the operational numerical weather predic-
tion model of Météo-France. MOCAGE has 47 vertical hy-
brid sigma-pressure levels from the surface up to 5 hPa. The
