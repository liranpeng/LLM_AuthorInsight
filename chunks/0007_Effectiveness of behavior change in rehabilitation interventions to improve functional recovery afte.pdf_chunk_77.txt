ing problems and infection. Most studies have been powered 
to detect a change in PROMs, not complications [24, 35]. 
Thus, they may be insufficiently powered to detect signifi-
cant differences in adverse events. One study comparing 
different immobilisation and weight-bearing strategies even 
stopped recruitment early due to superior PROMs in the 
early movement and weight-bearing group [45]. The largest 
single study in this area inadvertently masked this issue by
