The isolated effect of climate change on total ozone is
shown for the six models that have done Scenario 1 (or 1d) in
Fig. 3 by the red bars. As already suggested by the discussion
of zonal-mean ozone change, the effect of climate change on
the tropospheric ozone column is positive in all CCMs that
have made this calculation, except DLR E39C, which yields
a small reduction. The climate change signal is largely a
result of the competing effects of increased humidity and in-
