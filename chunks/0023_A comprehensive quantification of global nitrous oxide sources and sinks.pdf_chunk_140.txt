N2O fluxes represent the sum of the effects of climate, increased atmos-
pheric CO2 and land cover change. The estimate of climate and CO2 
effects on emissions was based on NMIP. The effect of land cover change 
on N2O dynamics includes the reduction due to ‘Long-term effect of 
reduced mature forest area’ and the emissions due to ‘Post-deforestation 
pulse effect’. The two estimates were based on the book-keeping 
approach and the DLEM model simulation. The book-keeping method
