as ice sheet melt and permafrost thaw. The slow feedbacks,
whose timescales depend on how strongly the climate system
is being forced, will substantially determine the magnitude of
climate impacts and affect how difﬁcult the task of stabilizing
climate will be.
Quantitative assessment of both ongoing and paleo-
temperature change is needed to deﬁne acceptable limits on
human-made interference with climate, with paleoclimate es-
pecially helpful for characterizing long-term ice sheet and
