chemistry, we develop a proxy to infer OH spatial variations and their sensitivity to individual photochemical drivers over 30 different regions in the remote marine troposphere. Two terms, water vapor and nitric oxide, contribute most of the within-region proxy variations, implying that a limited set of observations could serve as bellwethers of changing atmospheric oxidation patterns.
