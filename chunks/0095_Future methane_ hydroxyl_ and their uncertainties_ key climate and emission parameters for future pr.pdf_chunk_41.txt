ECHAM model also simulates the same features, using dif-
ferent chemistry and emissions that include biogenic vari-
ations (Montzka et al., 2011). Oslo CTM3 has the least
variability (0.65 % for Ïƒ/mean), while GEOS-Chem with
MERRA meteorology has the most (1.1 %). The common
features, as well as differences in their magnitude, are ex-
plained below by a small number of processes (Sect. 3.3).
