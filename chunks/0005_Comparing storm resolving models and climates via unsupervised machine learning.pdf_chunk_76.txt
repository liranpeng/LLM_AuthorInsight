to a normalized range between 0 and 1. We do this consistently across all samples using the range measured 
across the entire dataset. To ensure uniform structure across all samples, we interpolate the input images onto a 
standardized vertical (pressure) and horizontal grid. This is necessary to account for differences in the GSRMsâ€™ 
respective grid structures when performing pairwise comparisons.
