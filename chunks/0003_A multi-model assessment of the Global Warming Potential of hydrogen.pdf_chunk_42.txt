it alone would contribute
an
uncertainty of ±2.1 (assuming a standard deviation on the soil
sink of ±15 Tg yr−1 based on published soil sink values5,17 and
our model spread). Note, however, that the uncertainty linked to
the AGWP of CO2 is comparable in size–a contribution of ±1.8 to
the uncertainty, if it were the sole source of uncertainty. The
uncertainty in atmospheric loss of hydrogen due to OH is the
third largest term, and accounts for ±0.43 when considered on its
own.
