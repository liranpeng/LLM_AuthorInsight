UCI 2016.  Direct parcel-by-parcel comparison of modeled 24-hour reactivities (top row: P-O3, L-O3, L-CH4; all 
ppb/day) and photolysis rates (J-NO2, J-O1D; all /sec) calculated for a data stream of 14,880 simulated air parcels 
from 60 ºS to 60 ºN, 0.5 km to 12 km altitude, and along 180 ºW, see Prather et al., 2018.  Each point is an average 
of the 5 simulated dates in August (8/01, 8/06, 8/11, 8/16, 8/21). UCI 2016 ref uses full cloud quadrature and the
