of enhanced CO at these locations, but the magnitude is of-
ten underestimated (Fig. 2d–f), especially for the Azores–
Kangerlussuaq ﬂight. Figure S6 shows the CO results for
the Azores–Kangerlussuaq ﬂight using forecast wind ﬁelds
and illustrates the temporal evolution of CO plumes along
the ﬂight track. Comparison of Fig. S6 with Fig. 2f shows
that the impact of using analysis versus forecast wind ﬁelds
is small for this ﬂight since the forecasts already capture the
timing of the plumes.
