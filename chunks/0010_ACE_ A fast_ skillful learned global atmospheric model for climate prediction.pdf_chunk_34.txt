Computational expense
Training time for each seed was about 63 hours on four NVIDIA-A100s.
Running inference on a single A100 requires about one second of wall clock time per simulated day.
For comparison, the reference simulation ran on 96 cores of AMD EPYC 7H12 processors and took
∼77 seconds per simulated day. The 2x coarser resolution baseline ran on 24 cores in ∼45 seconds
per simulated day.
