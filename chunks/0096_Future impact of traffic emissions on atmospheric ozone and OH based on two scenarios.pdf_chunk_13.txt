port sectors AIRcraft, maritime SHIPping and ROAD traf-
ﬁc have been studied individually. This is important because
the different sectors emit various compositions of gases and
particles, and at different locations, which leads to substan-
tially different impacts on climate. More speciﬁcally, the cli-
mate impact of ROAD is dominated by warming from CO2
while AIR is also dominated by warming from contrail cir-
rus formation, although the magnitude of this process is un-
