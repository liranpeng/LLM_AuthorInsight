emission (mean: 7.3; min–max: 4.2–11.4 Tg N yr−1), of which direct and 
indirect emissions from nitrogen additions in agriculture and other 
sectors contributed around 52% and around 18%, respectively. Of the 
remaining anthropogenic emissions, about 27% were from other direct 
anthropogenic sources including fossil fuel and industry (around 13%), 
with about 3% from perturbed fluxes caused by changes in climate, 
CO2 or land cover.
