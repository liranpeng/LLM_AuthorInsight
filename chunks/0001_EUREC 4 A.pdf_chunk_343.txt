Brief description
Particle counter
DMT cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNC) measuring the number of particles which can acti-
vate cloud droplets at a speciÔ¨Åc supersaturation (0.1 % to 0.6 % supersaturation)
Sun photometer
MICROTOPS sun photometer capturing at sun views the solar attenuation at 380, 440, 670, 870,
and 940 nm to derive column properties of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at these wavelengths and the
