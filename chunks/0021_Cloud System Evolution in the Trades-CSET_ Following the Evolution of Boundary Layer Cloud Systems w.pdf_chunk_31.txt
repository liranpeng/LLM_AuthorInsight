horizontal cloud and precipitation inhomogeneity that a cloud radar and lidar combination 
can provide (e. g. Bretherton et al. 2010b; Wood et al. 2011b).
LES models have become a robust tool for Lagrangian simulations of subtropical cloudiness 
transitions, but there are few good datasets for comprehensively testing these simulations. In
