rise on the timescale of a century. Modeling supports this
conclusion, as Pollard et al. (2015) found that addition of
hydro-fracturing and cliff failure to their ice sheet model
not only increased simulated sea level rise from 2 to 17 m
in response to 2 â—¦C ocean warming but also accelerated the
time for multi-meter change from several centuries to several
decades. Ice sheet modeling of Applegate et al. (2015) ex-
plicitly shows that the timescale for large ice sheet melt de-
