imation, and thus for each model we compared the A runs
using the model’s restart data with a parallel standard 24 h
simulation (including transport, scavenging, and emissions).
Because the standard grid-cell air moves and mixes, we com-
pared averages over a large region (e.g., tropical Paciﬁc). We
ﬁnd some average biases of order ±10 % but general agree-
ment. The largest systematic biases in the A runs are caused
by buildup of HOOH (no scavenging) and decay of NOx (no
