Table 2. Representativeness of reactivities (L-CH4, L-O3, and P-O3 – all in ppb day−1) averaged over three latitude and three pressure
domains over the central Paciﬁc (155–233◦E). The ﬁrst standard deviation (ppb day−1) is over the different longitudinal transects on mid-
August; and the second (%) is for the average across longitudes sampled over 31 days of August.
