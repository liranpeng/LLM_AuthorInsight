ture dependence of L-CH4 and possibly because of differing
OH : HO2 ratios with altitude. Large P-O3 (> 6 ppb/d) oc-
curs in some but not all of these highly reactive L-O3 regions,
suggesting that NOx is not as evenly distributed as HOx is.
P-O3 also show regions of high reactivity above 8 km that
are not in the high L-O3 and L-CH4 regions, probably evi-
dence of convective sources of HOx and NOx but too cold
and dry for the L-O3 and L-CH4 reactions. ATom-1 RF1
