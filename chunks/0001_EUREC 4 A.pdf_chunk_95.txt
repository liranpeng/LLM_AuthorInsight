BCO. Dots show CU-RAAVEN measurements of the density po-
tential temperature vs. altitude, as well as underwater glider mea-
surements of the temperature below the surface. Values are normal-
ized to compensate for differences associated with either synoptic
variations or from variations in the depth of the sampled planetary
boundary layers. Blue dots show proﬁle of cloud fraction from all
MPCK proﬁles. The dashed (black) line marks the potential temper-
