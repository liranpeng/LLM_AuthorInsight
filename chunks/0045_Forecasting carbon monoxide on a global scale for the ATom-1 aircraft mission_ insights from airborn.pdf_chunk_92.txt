(r = 0.64), there is no signiﬁcant correlation between June–
August biomass burning in Indonesia and MOPITT CO over
New Zealand. However, August is not the peak season for In-
donesian biomass burning (Duncan et al., 2003b). The large
Indonesian ﬁres that occurred during the strong 1997/1998
El Niño peaked during September to November (Duncan et
al., 2003a), and active ﬁre detections for the 2015 Indonesian
ﬁres peaked in September and October (Field et al., 2016).
