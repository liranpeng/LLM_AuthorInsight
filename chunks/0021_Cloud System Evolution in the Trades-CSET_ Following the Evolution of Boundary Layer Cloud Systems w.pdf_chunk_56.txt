(e.g. Kollias et al, 2000; Giangrande et al 2012; Ming et al, 2017). Mie notches were 
observed frequently during CSET and will be used to deduce vertical air motions in more 
heavily precipitating clouds using the HCR.
The HSRL used in CSET is an eye-safe calibrated lidar system that measures backscatter 
cross section, extinction and depolarization properties of atmospheric aerosols and clouds 
(Razenkov et al. 2002 and 2008). The HSRL provides estimates of cloud base heights while
