used to evaluate the performance of the different surrogate
models. We keep the formulation as generic as possible with
respect to all paramterization output variables. We also keep
the definition general so that it can accommodate the eval-
uation either on the whole test dataset (points concatenated
across space and time) or on a subset of the test dataset (with
concatenation along time and/or some specific space dimen-
sions). Global error metrics will be evaluated across all test
