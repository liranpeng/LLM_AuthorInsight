Africa during winter (Fig. 4) reﬂect the strong co-location of
biomass burning emissions and convection in the Southern
Hemisphere subtropics when the ITCZ has shifted south of
the Equator. By comparison, lower CO-tracer mixing ratios
over equatorial Africa during summer reﬂect both a south-
ward migration in emissions and a northward migration of
the ITCZ, resulting in weaker convective lofting in this re-
gion (Fig. 5). The larger CO-tracer mixing ratios at higher
