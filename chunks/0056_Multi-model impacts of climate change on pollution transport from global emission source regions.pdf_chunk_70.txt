not produce an increase in the vertical column. Similar differ-
ence patterns occur in summer, except that the narrow region
of increase is above the surface, is smaller in magnitude and
vertical extent, and is centred south of the Equator, where
present-day CO-tracer concentrations peak (coinciding with
the summer biomass burning peak) (Fig. 3). The fractional or
relative changes in CO-tracer concentrations between winter
and summer are fairly similar (not shown).
