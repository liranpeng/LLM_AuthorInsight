usually based on Euler forward time differencing (two-time-
level schemes). Several schemes in this intercomparison are
based on that approach, and they differ in area approxima-
tion, reconstruction method, and implementation grid (for a
detailed discussion on area approximations and reconstruc-
tion methods, see, for example, Lauritzen et al., 2011b). Un-
less stated otherwise the schemes based on “swept areas” use
the super-cycling technique for coupling tracer and air mass.
