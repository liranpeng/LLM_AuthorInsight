photolysis rates, and found an inter-year RMSD about half of
that of the core model’s RMSD. Thus, there is a fundamental
uncertainty in this approach due to the inability to specify the
cloud/photolysis history seen by a parcel over 24 h, but it is
less than the inter-model differences among the most similar
models.
