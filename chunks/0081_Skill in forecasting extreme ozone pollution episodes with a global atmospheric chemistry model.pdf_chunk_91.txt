events based strictly on absolute concentrations (Dawson et
al., 2008; Nolte et al., 2008; Zanis et al., 2011).
We deÔ¨Åne AQX events based on the local PDF of O3 con-
centrations, rather than based on exceeding a concentration
threshold. This enables us to identify linked extreme events
whose absolute magnitudes evolve over space and time. For
example, Fig. 8 shows daily MDA8 O3 for June 2002 in
four grid cells in the Midwest and eastern US (Chicago, IL;
