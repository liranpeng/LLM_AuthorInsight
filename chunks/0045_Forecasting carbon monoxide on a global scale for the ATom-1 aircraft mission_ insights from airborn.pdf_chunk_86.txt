over June through August to account for the persistence of
CO in the atmosphere.
Among the regions mapped here, the tropical Atlantic
shows the highest average CO values, as well as the high-
est 2016 CO values, in both MOPITT and MLS observations
(Fig. 9). This is consistent with large biomass burning emis-
sions from Southern Hemisphere Africa transported into the
tropical Atlantic. While Southern Hemisphere Africa has the
largest magnitude of biomass burning, its relative variability
