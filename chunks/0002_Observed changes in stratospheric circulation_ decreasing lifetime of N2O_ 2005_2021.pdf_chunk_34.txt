negative, correction would further increase this trend.
We believe that the solar cycle has had little impact on
N2O lifetime variability over the Aura MLS record here. The
period 2005–2011 following Cycle 23 showed low activity
(smoothed monthly sunspot number <50), the peak of Cy-
cle 24 (2011–2015) was among the lowest in the last 100
years, and Cycle 25 began in 2020 but activity remained low
through 2021. We conclude that the impact of the solar cycle
