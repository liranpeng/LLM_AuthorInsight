of the range in conditions, there is no single offset, but we
have a probability distribution whose width in rlnJ due to a
range of surface albedo has a magnitude that affects the in-
terpretation of measurement–model differences. For high sun
(SZA = 0–40◦), choosing an optimal ﬁxed albedo of 0.06 re-
sults in little mean bias, although individual errors are about
±2 %. This error is based on conditions for cos(SZA) > 0.8.
If the ﬁxed albedo differs from this optimum (e.g., 0.00 or
