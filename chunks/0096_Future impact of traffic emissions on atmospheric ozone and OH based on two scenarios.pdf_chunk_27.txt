Six global atmospheric chemistry models have been used
in this study, where Ô¨Åve are Chemistry Transport Models
(CTMs) which were driven by 6 hourly operational me-
teorological data from the European Centre for Medium-
Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and one is a Climate
Chemistry Model (CCM) which was nudged towards the
ECMWF data (LMDz-INCA). This provides some consis-
tency between the various models in that the meteorological
