tant factors (e.g., Table 2 of Holmes et al., 2013), these quan-
tities have often been relegated to the physical climate system
and are not often thought of a major source of model error
in the chemical system. Thus, when we diagnose the future
tropospheric O3 or CH4 from the multi-model comparisons
(Stevenson et al., 2013; Voulgarakis et al., 2013; Young et
al., 2018; Grifﬁths et al., 2021), we need to document biases
