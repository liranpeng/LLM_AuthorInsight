HEL(-ND)
HEL and HEL-ND use the same settings as for CSLAM. The
ﬁlter parameters are the same in HEL and HEL-ND: both
are run without ﬁlters in the underlying ﬁrst-order version of
CSLAM. The number of Lagrangian parcels are equal to the
number of grid cells, and the parcels “survive” for the total
duration of the simulation. They are initialized at the grid cell
