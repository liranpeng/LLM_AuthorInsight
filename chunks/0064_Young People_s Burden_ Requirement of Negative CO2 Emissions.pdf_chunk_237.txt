and v4 (Fig. A3c), which leads us to suspect that the magni-
tude of the 1940s global warming maximum (Fig. 2) is exag-
gerated; i.e., it is partly spurious. We suggest that this warm-
ing spike warrants scrutiny in the next version of the SST
analysis. However, the important point is that these data ad-
justments and uncertainties are small in comparison with the
long-term warming. Adjustments between ERSST.v3b and
ERSST.v4 increase global warming over the period 1950â€“
