be noted here that B1 ACARE is a mitigation scenario as-
suming extensive technological improvements to the aircraft
and is considered very optimistic in terms of emissions (see
H2011). For comparison, Skeie et al. (2009) used the same
set of emissions data for the A1B and B1 scenarios to yield
RF due to O3 of 82 and 38 mW m−2, respectively, signif-
icantly higher than our forcing results. The main reasons
