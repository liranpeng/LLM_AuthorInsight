Since (semi-)Lagrangian ﬁnite-volume schemes trace La-
grangian volumes rather than ﬂuxes through cell walls, shape
preservation cannot be ensured using FCT and FCT-type
limiters. Shape preservation in semi-Lagrangian ﬁnite vol-
ume (not ﬂux form) can be accomplished via slope-limiting
where the reconstruction function is limited to avoid spurious
under- and overshoots.
