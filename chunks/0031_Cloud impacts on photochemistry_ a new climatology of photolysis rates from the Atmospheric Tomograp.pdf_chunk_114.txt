sion 8 (v8). In Cloud-J there are ﬁve incident angles on the
lower surface: the direct solar beam and the four ﬁxed-angle
downward streams of scattered light. The OSA modules are
adapted from the codes of Séférian et al. (2018) based on
Jin et al. (2011), but we do not use their approximation for
a single “diffuse” radiation since all of Cloud-Js scattered
light is resolved by zenith angle. The resulting albedo is a
function of wavelength, wind speed, and chlorophyll; it is
