hibit ±20 % ranges in RF components (e.g., Eyring et al.,
2007; Hoor et al., 2009; Myhre et al., 2011). Three sources
of uncertainty, when combined in quadrature, are therefore
sufﬁcient to explain the ±30 % range of ship RF components
in the literature ensemble: non-linearity from the ship emis-
sion perturbation magnitude (±10 to 20 %), emissions from
other sources (±10 %), and other processes that control back-
ground atmospheric composition (±10 to 20 %).
