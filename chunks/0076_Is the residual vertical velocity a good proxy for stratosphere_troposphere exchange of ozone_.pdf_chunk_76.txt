compared to cycle 36r1, the NH mean and seasonal variability of O3 STE are about 20–40% larger, but the
interannual variability is larger by a factor of 3–4. Most importantly between these two simulations, the tem-
poral variation for the residual ﬂuxes driven the BDC remains similar to each other but very diﬀerent for
all other O3 ﬂuxes. Such diﬀerences are also likely to occur across diﬀerent CCM models, if we apply accu-
