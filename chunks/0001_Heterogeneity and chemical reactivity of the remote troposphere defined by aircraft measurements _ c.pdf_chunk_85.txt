are seeing basic differences in the chemical models across
GC, GMI, and UCI. F0AM is the next closest to these cen-
tral models, but it will inherently have a larger rms because
it is a 1 d calculation and not a 5 d average. NCAR’s rms is
consistently higher and likely related to what is seen in the
5 d σ values in Table S9. GISS is clearly different from all
the others (L-CH4 rms > 100 %, while L-O3 rms < 66 %).
