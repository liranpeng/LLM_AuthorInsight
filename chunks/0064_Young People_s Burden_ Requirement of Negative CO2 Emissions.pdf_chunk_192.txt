that human-caused climate effects such as increased deserti-
ﬁcation can lead to increased aerosols, we do not anticipate
a large reduction in the aerosol cooling effect, even if fossil
fuel use declines. Rao et al. (2017) suggest that future aerosol
amount will decline due to technological advances and global
action to control emissions. We are not conﬁdent of such a
decline, as past controls have been at least matched by in-
creasing emissions in developing regions, and global popu-
