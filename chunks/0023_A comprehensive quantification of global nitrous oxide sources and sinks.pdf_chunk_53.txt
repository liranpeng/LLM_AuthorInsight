Four decades of anthropogenic N2O emissions
Trends in anthropogenic emissions were found to vary among regions 
(Fig. 3). Fluxes from Europe and Russia decreased by a total of 0.6 
(0.5–0.7) Tg N yr−1 over the 37 years from 1980 to 2016. The decrease in 
Europe is associated with successful emissions abatement in industry 
as well as agricultural policies, whereas the decrease in Russia is asso-
ciated with the collapse of the agricultural cooperative system after
