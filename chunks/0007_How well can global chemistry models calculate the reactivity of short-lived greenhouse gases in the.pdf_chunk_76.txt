cent that also occur in the top-X % reference case. For a
range of X, 5, 10, 25, and 50 %, the overlap increases suc-
cessively with many models having 90 % overlap for the top-
50 %. The exceptions are GFDL with lower than typical over-
lap for L-O3 at all top-X % levels, and GISS, with lower
overlap for L-CH4. This new diagnostic is helpful in under-
standing these model differences because it implies that the
