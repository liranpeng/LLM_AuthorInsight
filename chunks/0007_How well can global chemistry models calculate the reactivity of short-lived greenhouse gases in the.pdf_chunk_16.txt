coherent air mass to a heterogeneous mix of smaller features
(Batchelor, 1952; Prather and Jaffe, 1990). Yet, simulating
the photochemical changes in CH4 and O3 requires integra-
tion over the daily cycle of photolytic rates, which change
greatly and irregularly over the day based on the interac-
tion of the sun and cloud systems. Unfortunately, there is no
known approach to track and measure the 24 h net change in
ozone or methane for an air parcel in the free troposphere.
