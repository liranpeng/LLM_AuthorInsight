W m−2 averaged over Solar-J and RRTMG-SW for each region. Note that different y-axis scales have been used for large SZAs.
the scattered light has only one angle, and thus the above-
cloud heating (second row of Fig. 6) is strictly proportional to
the top-of-atmosphere increases. With Solar-J, the reﬂected
light is calculated at four zenith angles with the ﬂux at larger
zenith angles producing more heating (i.e., longer slant path
through the atmosphere). This is most apparent in the case
