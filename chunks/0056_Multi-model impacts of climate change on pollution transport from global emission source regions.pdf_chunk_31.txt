the same driving global climate model (GCM); however,
their advection schemes differ substantially since STOC-
HadAM3 is the only model to use a Lagrangian approach
to simulate transport processes. Deep convection schemes
used by the models are based on two main parameter-
isations: Gregory and Rowntree (1990) for GISS-E2-R,
UM-CAM, and STOC-HadAM3; and Zhang and McFar-
lane (1995) for CMAM. In addition, STOC-HadAM3 uses
