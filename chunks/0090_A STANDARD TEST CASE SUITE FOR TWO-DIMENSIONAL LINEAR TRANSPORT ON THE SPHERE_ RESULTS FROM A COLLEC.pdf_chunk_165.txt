well ﬁlaments are preserved in terms of how well a scheme
preserved the total area for which φ is larger than a threshold
value τ.
The cosine bell initial conditions are chosen for this test
as they are quasi-smooth (but not inﬁnitely smooth) and
have mixing ratio values that span the entire range from the
background value of 0.1 to the peak value, φ = 1.0. Slotted-
cylinder initial conditions, for example, only have two val-
ues, and simulations using that initial conditions would there-
