Algorithmic considerations
General properties of the algorithms are given in Table 3.
First of all, the width of the computation halo used to update
cell/grid-point value is listed. For example, if only the imme-
diate neighboring cell-average or grid-point values are used,
the width of the halo is one. This width should give an indi-
cation of message sizes in parallel computing environments.
The number of communications needed per time step is in-
