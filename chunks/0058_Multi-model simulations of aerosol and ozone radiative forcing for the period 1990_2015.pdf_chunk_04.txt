Abstract. Over the past few decades, the geographical distri-
bution of emissions of substances that alter the atmospheric
energy balance has changed due to economic growth and air
pollution regulations. Here, we show the resulting changes to
aerosol and ozone abundances and their radiative forcing us-
ing recently updated emission data for the period 1990â€“2015,
as simulated by seven global atmospheric composition mod-
els. The models broadly reproduce large-scale changes in
