(0–0.5, 0.5–5, 5–30, > 30) are present in each FCA. Here
we extend that approach with three new methods for approx-
imating the integral over ICAs: deﬁne each QCA from the
average ICAs in its domain (AvQCA); use the averaged di-
rect solar beam from all ICAs to derive an effective scattering
optical depth from clouds in each layer (AvDir); and select-
ing three random ICAs based on their weights (Ran-3; with
comparable computational costs to either QCA).
