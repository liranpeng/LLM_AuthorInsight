p = 3 and η = 4.0 for p = 6. We call the former “conver-
gence regime” and the latter “mixing regime”. Chosen pa-
rameters are summarized in Table A1.

ICON-FFSL
The ICON grid is derived from a spherical icosahedron that is
made up of 20 equilateral spherical triangles. This base grid
is further reﬁned in a multi-step procedure, until the desired
resolution is reached. In a ﬁrst step, the root division step, the
edges of each base triangle are divided into n equal sections
