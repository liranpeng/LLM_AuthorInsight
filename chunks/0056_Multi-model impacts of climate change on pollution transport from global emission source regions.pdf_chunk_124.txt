deep convection under climate change will conÔ¨Åne pollution
more closely to its surface source regions, potentially reduc-
ing intercontinental transport in upper-level winds aloft. In
the mid-latitudes transport of pollution aloft may be impacted
by a poleward shift in storm track pathways. Hence, trans-
port changes alone in the absence of stricter emissions con-
trols may reduce future air quality in the vicinity of emission
source regions especially in the tropics, due to reductions in
