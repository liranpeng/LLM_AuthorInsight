using SJ/noIR ranges from +5% (bottom) to +25% (top), with similar values for cirrus ice clouds. At the top 
of a stratus cloud, SJ/66b heating rates are 1.8 K per day, while SJ/noIR calculates 2.3 K per day (both are 
without IR gas absorption). We can include IR gas absorption in SJ and find that heating rates in the upper 
layers of the stratus cloud are reduced by about a third because of the absorption by water vapor above the
