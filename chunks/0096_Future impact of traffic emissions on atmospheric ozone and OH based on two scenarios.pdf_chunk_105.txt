will be a shift from slightly negative net RF in 2000
(−0.44 ± 13 mW m−2) to strong negative net RF in 2050 (of
−32 ± 9.3 (B1) and −32 ± 18 mW m−2 (A1B)), mainly due
to the combined impact of enhanced cooling from SHIP and
reduced warming from ROAD. However, the total climate
effect of future transport emissions, also taking into account
the RF terms from aerosols and long-lived greenhouse gases,
is largely positive and dominated by warming due to CO2
