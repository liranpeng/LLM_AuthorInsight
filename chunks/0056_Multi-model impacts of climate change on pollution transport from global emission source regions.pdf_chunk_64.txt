shows robust features that are statistically signiﬁcant across
the four CCMs (Figs. 2 and 3). This suggests a general con-
sistency in changes in transport between 1995–2006 and
2090–2099 under the RCP 8.5 climate scenario. In gen-
eral, in both winter and summer, CO-tracer mixing ratio de-
creases are ubiquitous throughout most of the troposphere.
