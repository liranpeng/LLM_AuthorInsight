More on hyperviscosity scaling
In case of tracer advection, different amounts of artiﬁcial dis-
sipation affect performance of the scheme in various ways.
For example, with η = p + 1, the theoretical spatial conver-
gence order is p + 1. If η < p + 1, convergence rates are ex-
pected to be of the order of η. Bigger amounts of hypervis-
cosity raise standard errors but improve preservation of pre-
existing functional relations and ﬁlament preservation diag-
