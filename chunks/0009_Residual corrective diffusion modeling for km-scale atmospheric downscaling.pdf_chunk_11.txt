potential to exceed the fidelity of conventional statistical
downscaling.
The stochastic nature of atmospheric physics at km-scale20 renders
downscaling inherently probabilistic, making it natural to explore
generative models at these scales. Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) have been tested, including for forecasting precipitation at
km-scale in various regions21,22,23,24,25,26; see the latter for a good
review. Training GANs, however, poses several practical challenges
