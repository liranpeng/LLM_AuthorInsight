in oxidant chemistry on sulfate aerosol, where more CH4 leads
to less OH and correspondingly less cooling via sulfate aerosol.
A multi-model study, however, suggests a smaller sensitivity
of aerosols to oxidant changes.27 Furthermore, the net RF
due to increases in CH4 emissions since pre-industrial times
has been partially oï¬€set by increases in NOx emissions (which
decrease CH4 by increasing global OH). Scenarios for the
21st century indicate a wide range of possible CH4 abundances
