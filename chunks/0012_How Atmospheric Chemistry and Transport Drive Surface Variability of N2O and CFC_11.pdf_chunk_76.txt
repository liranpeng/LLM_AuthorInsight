the lifetime of UCI F11X during the MLS overlap period at 63 years, which is slightly longer than GMI's at 
57 years. The timing of most F11X extrema matches well across the two models (cc = 0.47 for GMI vs. UCI 
F11X) and is comparable with their N2OX counterparts, indicating transport variations in the lower strato-
sphere are similar between MERRA-2 and ECMWF-IFS. The systematic difference in N2OX loss frequency
