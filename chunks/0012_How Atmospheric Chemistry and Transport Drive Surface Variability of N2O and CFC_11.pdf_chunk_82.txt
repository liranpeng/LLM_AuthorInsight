3.1.  Introduction and Methods
The Brewer-Dobson overturning circulation transports air masses throughout the stratosphere (Butch-
art, 2014), bringing air containing tropospheric levels of N2O and CFCl3 upward in the tropics to their 
respective loss regions where they are photolyzed or destroyed by O(1D). Then, air that is photochemically 
depleted in these gases is transported down to the lower stratosphere outside the tropics where STE carries
