approximation, I calculate a mean amplitude of 17.0, 6.4, 1.3,
1.2, and 1.3 ppm for BRW, MLO, SMO, CGO, and SPO, re-
spectively. These results are almost identical to those from
the composited annual cycles (Fig. 1b) but disagree at SMO
as might be expected because of its double-peaked cycle. A
linear ﬁt to the standard deviations gives trends for the pe-
riod 1985–2020 of 1.06±0.15, 0.142±0.075, 0.082±0.047,
0.079 ± 0.051, and 0.031 ± 0.050 ppm per decade for BRW,
