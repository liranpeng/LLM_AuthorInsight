concentrations generally follow changes in SO2 emissions.
Changes in NOx emissions inﬂuence nitrate aerosols to a lesser
extent than the SO2-sulfate relationship due to competition
between sulfate and nitrate for ammonium, such that nitrate
aerosol is inversely dependent on sulfate. Increases in ammonia
(NH3) emissions in conjunction with SO2 reductions enhance
nitrate aerosol, oﬀsetting some of beneﬁt from SO2 controls.241
