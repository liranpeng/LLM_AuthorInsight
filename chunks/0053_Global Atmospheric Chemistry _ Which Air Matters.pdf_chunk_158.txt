J-values are being measured by ATom and can be analyzed
on a case-by-case basis (Palancar et al., 2011) to assess the
role of clouds in determining instantaneous reactivity. To be
useful as a climatology, the models would need to develop
statistics on how the observed J-values (with clouds) devi-
ated from clear-sky (modeled) values, thus checking if the
photolysis effect of the cloud statistics in the models is sim-
ilar that observed. In this case ATom is probably one of the
