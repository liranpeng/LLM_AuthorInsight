episode, but human discernment identiﬁes them as two dif-
ferent episodes adjoined by only a small number of events.
Our revised algorithm deﬁnes a cutoff in order to separate
these dangling episodes. For each episode identiﬁed with the
primary algorithm, we calculate the area of the events for
each day and the area of events that are shared with the pre-
vious day (i.e., the same grid cell on 2 consecutive days). If
the ratio of the shared area divided by the total area of that
