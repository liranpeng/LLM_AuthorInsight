one of the EUREC4A research vessels. Plastic sensor casings,
parachutes, and/or remainders of the latex balloon add an ad-
ditional impact. This is minimized by designing the sondes to
sink to the ocean ï¬‚oor. Efforts are ongoing to identify differ-
ent materials to further reduce the environmental impact of
the sondes. One also questions whether the potential energy
loss by the sonde could be used to power the instrumentation
and whether a different and smaller sonde could forgo the use
