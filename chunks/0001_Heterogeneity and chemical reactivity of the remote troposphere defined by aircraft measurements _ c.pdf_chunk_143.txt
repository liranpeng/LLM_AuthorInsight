ﬁtted ellipses are almost identical for ATom 2, 3, and 4. Thus,
for these species in the central Paciﬁc, we believe that ATom
provides a benchmark of the 2016–2018 chemical state, one
that can be revisited with an aircraft mission in a decade to
detect changes in not only chemical composition, but also
reactivity.
ATom identiﬁes which “highly reactive” spatial or chem-
ical environments could be targeted in future campaigns for
process studies or to provide a better link between satellite
