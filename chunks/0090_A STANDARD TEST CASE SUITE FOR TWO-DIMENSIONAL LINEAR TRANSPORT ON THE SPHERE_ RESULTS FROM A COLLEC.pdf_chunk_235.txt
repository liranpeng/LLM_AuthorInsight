dicated through the number of stages used in the scheme.
The minimum number of communications needed to com-
plete a simulation can, in general, be deduced from the stable
time step limitations of the scheme. Here that is speciﬁed in
terms of maximum Courant number. For schemes that are not
Courant-number-limited but rather limited by the shear of the
ﬂow, we list “Lipschitz”, which refers to the criterion for sta-
bility for many trajectory algorithms in (semi-)Lagrangian
