Distribution of the key ATom species
We examine the distribution of key species over the Paciﬁc
Ocean and Atlantic Ocean basins with mean proﬁles of NOx
(v2b), NOxﬁt (v3), and HOOH in Fig. 56. In the Paciﬁc, the
impact of v3 NOx (labeled NOxx) is to reduce some high val-
ues in ATom-34 and make ATom-234 almost identical in the
Paciﬁc. ATom-1 NOx remains much smaller than the other
