maximum endurance of 10 ﬂight hours and a maximum ceil-
ing of 8.75 km. Flight strategies varied over the course of
the experiment but included circles at or above 7 km to de-
ploy dropsondes, slow proﬁles from 7 km to 500 ft/150 m
for water vapor sampling, stacked straight and level legs to
vertically sample horizontal variability at different heights
within the cloud and sub-cloud layers, and “lawnmower” pat-
terns at 2.75 to 3.00 km for deployment of airborne expend-
