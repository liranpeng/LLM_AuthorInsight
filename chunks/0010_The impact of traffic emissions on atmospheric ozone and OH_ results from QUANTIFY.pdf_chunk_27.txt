ozone precursors for the year 2000 with the exception of
methane.
Methane was prescribed as a surface boundary
condition using time dependent surface mixing ratios as in
J¨ockel et al. (2006) based on surface observations from the
AGAGE database.
For the initialization the three dimen-

used.
For biomass burning monthly means for the year 2000
were used based on GFED estimates with multi-year (1997–
