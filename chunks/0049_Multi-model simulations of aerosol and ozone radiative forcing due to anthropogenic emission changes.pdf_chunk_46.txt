clouds and surface albedo (Myhre et al., 2013a; Stier et al.,
2013). The IPCC AR5 estimate for direct aerosol effect of
sulfate was close to zero for the whole 1990–2010 period,
whereas the multi-model mean here is around +0.04 W m−2
in the year 2010, with further increase to +0.05 W m−2
in 2015. A main reason for this difference is that in the new
ECLIPSE emission inventory, global sulfate precursor emis-
sions show stronger reductions for this period than previ-
