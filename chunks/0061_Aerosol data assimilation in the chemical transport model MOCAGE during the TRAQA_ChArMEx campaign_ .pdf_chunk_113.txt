fairly small ≤15 km. Therefore, we will assume that LOAC
measurements represent the aerosol vertical proﬁle above the
launch place.
The ﬁrst two ﬂights (Fig. 9a and b) are launched at two
different times of the same day, in the morning and at noon,
but they ﬂew through the same desert dust plume. In both
cases, the assimilation model run matches the measurements
very closely. It simulates both the shape of the proﬁle and
the aerosol number concentration well. The direct model run
