tistical distribution of the individual J-cloudy to J-clear ra-
tios (rlnJ). To model clouds correctly we need to under-
stand how frequently and by how much clouds interfere with
J values. The statistical distribution of rlnJ shows distinct
patterns and classes of models. In the free troposphere (100â€“
900 hPa), all have a sharp edge at rlnJ = 0 with hardly any
diminished J values (rlnJ < 0), but the small-cloud-effects
models (GC, GFDL, GISS, GMI, UKCA) show a dom-
