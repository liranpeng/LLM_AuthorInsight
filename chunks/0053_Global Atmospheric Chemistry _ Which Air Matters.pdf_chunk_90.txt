of occurrence of chemical species in air parcels for the six
models here. These diagnostics are readily suited to high-
frequency in situ observations from an extensive aircraft mis-
sion such as ATom, for example see KÃ¶ppe et al. (2009). This
paper then takes a novel approach by focusing on the chem-
ical budgets for tropospheric ozone and methane. In addi-
tion to weighting a parcel according to its occurrence or par-
cel mass, we include a factor that accounts for the model-
