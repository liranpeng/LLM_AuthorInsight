we expect our CTM simulations based on reanalysis meteorological fields should include a semblance of 
the chemistry and transport variability, QBO and ENSO related, that affects surface N2O. Thus, we remove 
the modeled chemistry-transport-driven surface variability from the observed signal (i.e., NOAA observa-
tions minus models from FigureÂ S2) to search for an emissions signal tied to ENSO. Since the obvious QBO
