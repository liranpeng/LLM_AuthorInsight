sphere due to climate change is common to all models. Areas
of decreases are conÔ¨Åned to the lower tropical troposphere,
except in the UM CAM model where the region of ozone
decrease covers the entire troposphere between about 15 S
and 15 N. Relatively small signals from climate change are
seen in the CHASER model. As far as the stratosphere of
CHASER is concerned this is due to the fact that strato-
spheric ozone concentrations are relaxed to the same pre-
