scheme was run with semi-analytic trajectories, temporal
errors (due to trajectory computations) are minimal. The
asymptotic convergence rates for CSLAM are not affected
by time step in this setup. Similar observations are made for
the CCSRG.
The SBC scheme is also a semi-Lagrangian scheme, and,
contrary to the CSLAM setup, inexact trajectories were used.
At lower resolutions the spatial errors dominate so the ab-
solute errors increase with a decreased time step (similar
