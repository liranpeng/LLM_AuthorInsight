Abstract. Recently, a standard test case suite for 2-D lin-
ear transport on the sphere was proposed to assess im-
portant aspects of accuracy in geophysical ﬂuid dynam-
ics with a “minimal” set of idealized model conﬁgura-
tions/runs/diagnostics. Here we present results from 19 state-
of-the-art transport scheme formulations based on ﬁnite-
difference/ﬁnite-volume methods as well as emerging (in
