folding (e90) tracer between 1955 and 2099 have been re-
lated to trends in tropopause height (Abalos et al., 2017).
The aim of this paper is to explore the robustness of the
changes in transport found in the single-model study de-
scribed above across an ensemble of CCMs participating in
the recent Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model In-
tercomparison Project (ACCMIP) using a globally emitted
CO tracer (Lamarque et al., 2013) and to quantify for the
