Data synthesis
We consider global N2O emission from land and ocean consisting of 
natural fluxes and anthropogenic emissions estimated from bottom-up 
and top-down approaches; however, the top-down approach cannot 
separate natural and anthropogenic sources.
‘Natural soil baseline’ emissions were obtained from six terres-
trial biosphere models (Global N2O Model Intercomparison Project 
(NMIP)16, Supplementary Tables 16, 17) and reflect a situation without
