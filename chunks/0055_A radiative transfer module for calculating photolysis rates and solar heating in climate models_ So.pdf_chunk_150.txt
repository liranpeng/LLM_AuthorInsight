a sample of 640 tropical atmospheres where the generated
number of ICAs per grid cell ranged from 1 to 3500 and av-
eraged 170. Compared to the exact answer deﬁned by sepa-
rate calculations with all the weighted ICAs, cloud quadra-
ture achieves rms errors in instantaneous cell-averaged Js of
0 to 3 % throughout the troposphere, with most levels being
0–1 %. When Cloud-J is run selecting random ICAs (using
all wavelengths for each ICA, not the McICA approach), 50
