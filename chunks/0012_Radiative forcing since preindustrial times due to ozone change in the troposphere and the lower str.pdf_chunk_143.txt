tropopause (Hansen et al., 1997; Forster and Shine, 1997).
The balance between the LW and SW forcings is strongly
dependent on the altitude of the ozone change, primarily be-
cause of the height dependence of the LW. For ozone de-
pletion in the middle stratosphere, due to the infrared opac-
ity of the atmosphere between the mid-stratosphere and the
tropopause, the LW forcing will be much weaker than in the
lower stratosphere. Figure 7 shows the annual-mean radia-
