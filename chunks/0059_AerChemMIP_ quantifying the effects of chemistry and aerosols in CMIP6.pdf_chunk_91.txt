The total simulation years requested are 556 for Tier 1 and
492 for Tier 2.
Historical changes in methane and nitrous oxide abun-
dances have altered atmospheric chemistry and the NTCF
radiative forcing. These indirect effects are complex and
have previously been calculated in piecemeal ways (Myhre
et al., 2013a). In AerChemMIP, the historical transient ERFs
will be calculated for models that have reactive gas chem-
