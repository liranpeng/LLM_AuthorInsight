trolling black carbon (BC) emissions from transportation
sources depends on the ability to make ultra-low-sulfur fuels
(ULSF) available (Pawelec et al., 2011). ULSFs are necessary so
that diesel particulate filters (DPFs) can be applied to after-
engine exhaust to effectively eliminate BC emissions. Ideally,
the fuel content should be no more than 10 ppmw sulfur. Without
ULSF, the catalyst in the DPF will be poisoned by the sulfur in
the fuel (Hesterberg et al., 2011).
