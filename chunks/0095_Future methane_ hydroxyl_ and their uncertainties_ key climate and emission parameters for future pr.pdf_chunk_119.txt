climate scenarios. The range of future surface temperatures
in the CMIP5 ensemble is propagated to uncertainty in fu-
ture air temperature and water vapor using regression ﬁt-
ting errors from the historical reanalysis. In 2100, we cal-
culate air temperature and water vapor to be 3.6 ± 0.9 K
and 43.2 ± 9.5 % larger than 2010, respectively. For trop-
ical stratospheric ozone, multiple models predict recovery
