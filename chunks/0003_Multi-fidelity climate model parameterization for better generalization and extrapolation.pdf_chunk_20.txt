latent heat flux and surface sensible heat flux (figure 1).
The parameterization output is the subgrid-scale convec-
tive tendency of temperature, or heat tendency for short, and
the subgrid-scale convective tendency of specific humidity
throughout the column, or moisture tendency for short (fig-
ure 1). This tendency definition accounts for the sub-grid
advection of temperature and moisture by convection and fine-
scale turbulence, as well as for the effect of radiative heating
