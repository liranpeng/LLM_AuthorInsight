(gray line) and QCLS CO observations (circles) (a, b, c) for the (a) Anchorage–Kona ﬂight, (b) Kona–Pago Pago ﬂight, and (c) Pago Pago–
Christchurch ﬂight. Axis ranges vary between panels due to the large range of concentrations encountered. The top x axis indicates the
latitudes of the ﬂight track. (d–f) The GEOS-5 CO interpolated to the ﬂight track (red line) is compared to the observations (black circles).
(g–h) Tagged tracer contributions to the GEOS-5 CO.
