matter in this case, and this method shows skill in differen-
tiating among the models’ chemistry. Testing 100 km scale
models with 2 km measurements using these tools also ad-
dresses a core question about model resolution and whether
ﬁne-scale atmospheric structures matter to the overall ozone
and methane budget. A new method enabling these six global
chemistry–climate models to ingest an externally sourced cli-
matology and then compute air parcel reactivity is demon-
