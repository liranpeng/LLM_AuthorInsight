(see Sect. 3.2) from high value of 1λm (left) to low value of
1λm (right). The numerical value of ℓi is normalized with
ℓi for CSLAM with CN5.5 (ℓ(un)
i
(CSLAM)) at resolution
1λ ≈1.5. The reason for a graphical representation of “nor-
malized” data, ℓi/ℓ(un)
i
(CSLAM), rather than ℓi is to give the
reader a reference for the amount of mixing. The mixing di-
agnostic is relatively new, and numerical values of ℓi may
be less meaningful to the reader than normalized data. The
