J-NO2; e, J-O1D; all s−1) calculated for the 14 880 simulated air parcels. Each point is an average over the ﬁve simulated dates in August
(01/8, 06/8, 11/8, 16/8, 21/8). The 1 : 1 line is shown (black dashed) for each plot. The reference values (x axis) are the average of three
similar models (GSFC, GC, UCI) selected by examining the rms differences across all the models (see text). For this plot alone, models
