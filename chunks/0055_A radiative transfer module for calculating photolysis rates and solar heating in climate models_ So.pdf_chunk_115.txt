who show small negative errors in absorption from the cal-
culation of delta-Eddington (two-stream) approximation in
the case of the single-layer liquid cloud (re = 10 µm, τ ∼4)
with cos(SZA) > 0.2 (i.e., our SZAs of 0–62◦). For our SZA
of 84◦, this absorption bias reverses as is also found by Li
et al. (2015) for cos(SZA) < 0.2. In their study, the two-
stream calculations are compared to the 128-stream DIS-
ORT (discrete–ordinate) benchmark calculations using accu-
