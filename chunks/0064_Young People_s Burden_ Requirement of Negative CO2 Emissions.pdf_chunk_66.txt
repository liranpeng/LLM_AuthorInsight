of Hansen et al. (2005), are similar to those of Myhre et
al. (2013) in the most recent IPCC report (IPCC, 2013).8
Climate forcings in Fig. 4 are the planetary energy im-
balance that would be caused by the preindustrial-to-present
change in each atmospheric constituent, if the climate were
held Ô¨Åxed at its preindustrial state (Hansen et al., 2005). The
CH4 forcing includes its indirect effects, as increasing at-
