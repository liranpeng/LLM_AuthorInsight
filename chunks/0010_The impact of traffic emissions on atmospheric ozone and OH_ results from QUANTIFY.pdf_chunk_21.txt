and CO2 emissions only 3% higher, the ﬁnal global traf-
ﬁc emissions of NOx, NMHC and CO are higher by 33%,
48% and 51%, respectively. The integrated annual emissions
which were used in this study for selected species had to use
the draft emissions and are given in Table 1.
The emissions for ship trafﬁc were reconstructed for
QUANTIFY based on fuel- and activity-based esimates by
Endresen et al. (2007). They report a fuel consumption be-
ing about 50–80 Mt (≈70–80%) lower than in Eyring et al.
