Climate sensitivity and feedbacks
Climate sensitivity has been a fundamental issue at least
since the 19th century, when Tyndall (1861) and Arrhe-
nius (1896) stimulated interest in the effect of CO2 change
on climate. Evaluation of climate sensitivity involves the full
complexity of the climate system, as all components and pro-
cesses in the system are free to interact on all timescales.
Tyndall and Arrhenius recognized some of the most impor-
