and reﬂection of sunlight over the full spectrum. Scattering
and absorption by large aerosols (dust) and clouds are impor-
tant for heating rates at these longer wavelengths. The long-
term goal is to develop Solar-J as a single module for climate
models, albeit with increased computational cost, delivering
photolysis rates and more accurate shortwave heating rates,
particularly for aerosol and cloud radiative forcing.
