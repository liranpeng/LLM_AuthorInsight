tween the models (e.g. different model resolution and chem-
istry scheme) and this is illustrated in H2011 Figs. B1â€“B2,
which show zonal mean O3 impacts from AIR and SHIP for
each of the six models in 2050 B1. Similar inter-model dif-
ferences apply for the A1B scenario presented here. The O3
impact from SHIP differs less between the scenarios, but is
still larger in A1B with a peak value over the North Atlantic
Ocean of 6 ppbv (Fig. 2) compared to 4 ppbv in B1 (H2011).
