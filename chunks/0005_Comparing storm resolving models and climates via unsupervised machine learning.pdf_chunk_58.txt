latent heat flux, and the smallest lower tropospheric stability values (as defined ­in41) (Fig. S13). This unique 
atmospheric state at locations of this convective mode, combined with its very distinct 
√
w′w′ profile (Green lines 
in Fig. 6d), suggests it does in fact deserve to be separated out from other types of convection despite its scarcity.
Although other studies have made note of this convective ­form42–44, our distribution shift analysis shows that
