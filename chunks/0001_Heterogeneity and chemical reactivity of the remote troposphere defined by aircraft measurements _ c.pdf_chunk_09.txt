scale (100 km) differ only slightly from the 2 km ATom 10 s data, indicating that much of the heterogeneity in
tropospheric chemistry can be captured with current global chemistry models. Comparing the ATom reactivities
over the tropical oceans with climatological statistics from six global chemistry models, we Ô¨Ånd generally good
agreement with the reactivity rates for O3 and CH4. Models distinctly underestimate O3 production below 2 km
