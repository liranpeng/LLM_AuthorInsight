with radiation in diï¬€erent ways depending on size and com-
position and contribute either a cooling or a warming forcing
on climate. The AR4 IPCC report10 estimated that the net
aerosol direct forcing from all anthropogenic components is
likely to be a cooling with a best estimate of 0.5  0.4 W m2.
Myhre et al.75 used a combination of models and satellite
observations to estimate the direct RF at 0.35 W m2 whereas
Bellouin et al.76 used satellite observations to estimate
