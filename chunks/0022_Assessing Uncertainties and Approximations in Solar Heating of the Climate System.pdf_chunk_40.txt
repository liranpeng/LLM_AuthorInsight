Practical RT solutions for the complex absorption features of atmospheric gases require selecting a limited 
number of representative wavelengths or wavelength bands for the calculation. Ideally, one picks as broad 
a band as possible that has nearly the same attenuation of sunlight across all wavelengths and can be accu-
