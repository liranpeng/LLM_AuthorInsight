of 10 380 L d−1. For our estimates we adopt the 8000 L d−1
burn rate for all the ships and estimate 5 d of ship ferry time,
so for four ships each with 30 d−1 of ship time we end up
with a total emission of 3000 t of CO2, which is about twice
the direct emissions from the research aircraft. The ship num-
bers are not offset by the reduced personal emissions of those
on the ship, i.e., who do not need hotels, or rental cars, or the
operation of their home labs, and often have reduced travel,
