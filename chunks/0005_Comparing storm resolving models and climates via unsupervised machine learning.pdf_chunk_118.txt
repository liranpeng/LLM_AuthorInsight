in Fig. 8). Taken as a whole, these results suggest that for robustness of the measurement of model distance, a 
higher value of K is most appropriate.
However, it is important to note that we do not care solely about the approximation of the KL divergence when 
we consider the cluster count. We also desire for interpretability for our cluster’s and for purposes of visualization 
we want each cluster to correspond to a unique regime of convection. Therefor, we still show results for lower
