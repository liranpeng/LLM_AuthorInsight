The Modeling Data Stream (MDS) developed for ATom
(G2023 plus this publication) relies on gap-Ô¨Ålling for spo-

tivities for the 10 s air parcels are to be calculated without
losing most of the parcels. The MDS concept was a rea-

(RDS); however, as we have seen with the successive MDS
versions, there is a painful learning curve for what to do
