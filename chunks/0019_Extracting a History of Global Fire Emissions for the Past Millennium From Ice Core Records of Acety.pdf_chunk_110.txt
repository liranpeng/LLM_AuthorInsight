The biomass burning histories of methane reconstructed here are sensitive to the isotopic end‐members
assigned to each source. It is likely that the methane isotope end‐members are dynamic and change through
time, particularly due to ecosystem shifts and changes in climate (Sowers, 2010). The complicated nature of
the methane isotope budget makes interpreting paleobiomass burning emissions challenging, particularly
