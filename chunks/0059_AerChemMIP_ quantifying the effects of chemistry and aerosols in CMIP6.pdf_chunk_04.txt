depleting halocarbons. The aim of AerChemMIP is to answer
four scientiÔ¨Åc questions.
1. How have anthropogenic emissions contributed to
global radiative forcing and affected regional climate
over the historical period?
2. How might future policies (on climate, air quality and
land use) affect the abundances of NTCFs and their cli-
mate impacts?
3. How do uncertainties in historical NTCF emissions af-
fect radiative forcing estimates?
4. How important are climate feedbacks to natural NTCF
