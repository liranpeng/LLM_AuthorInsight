frontal boundaries across more samples in Supplementary
SectionÂ 7.1, which reveals that CorrDiff consistently adjusts the
winds, temperature and radar reflectivity at the front, but that its
skill in sharpening frontal gradients exhibits case-to-case variability.
Examining the UNet cross sections (blue lines in all these figures)
we find that its predictions often fall within the range of one
standard deviation from the mean of CorrDiff predictions. However,
