for a coordinated set of simulations that allows for a con-
sistent and clean comparison between models. For example,
the CMIP5 Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model In-
tercomparison Project (ACCMIP) focusing on chemistry had
only three model results that could be used to assess climateâ€“
air quality links (Schnell et al., 2016).
NTCF precursor emissions are also responsible for driv-
ing regional and local air quality (Fiore et al., 2012). This
