included radar and lidar remote sensing of the clouds and MBL from an altitude of about 6 
km (20 kft) altitude along transects. In this mode, dropsondes were deployed to obtain the 
thermodynamic and wind structure in and above the MBL upstream and downstream from 
the StCu to Cu transition zone. The second—in situ mode—involved detailed profiling in the 
subcloud, cloud layer, and across the top of the boundary layer in three to four selected areas
