methods. Discretization grids range from traditional regular
latitude–longitude grids to more isotropic domain discretiza-
tions such as icosahedral and cubed-sphere tessellations of
the sphere. The schemes are evaluated using a wide range
of diagnostics in idealized ﬂow environments. Accuracy is
assessed in single- and two-tracer conﬁgurations using con-
ventional error norms as well as novel diagnostics designed
