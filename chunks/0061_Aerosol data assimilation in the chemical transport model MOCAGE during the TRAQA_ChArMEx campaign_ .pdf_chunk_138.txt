transport processes are more important than for ozone, but
the work of Jaumouillé et al. (2012) could give an idea of
what to expect in the model from redeﬁning the construction
of the matrices B and R. Moreover, it should be kept in mind
that using a dense observation ﬁeld, like our MODIS super-
observation ﬁeld, limits the effects of the spatial diffusion of
the increment. This makes the covariances of the matrix B
less important than in the case of sparse observations.
