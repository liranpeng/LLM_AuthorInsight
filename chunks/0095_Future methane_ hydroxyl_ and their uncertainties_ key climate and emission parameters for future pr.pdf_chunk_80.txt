production from ships (Chen et al., 2005), however. To com-
pensate, GEOS-Chem instantaneously converts all ship NOx
emissions to O3 and HNO3, following observed production
ratios. As a result, GEOS-Chem underestimates the large-
scale impact of shipping, since, in reality, 20â€“50 % of NOx
remains after 5 h following emission (Vinken et al., 2011).
Although previous estimates of ship NOx are close to the
high values in this work (Hoor et al., 2009; Myhre et al.,
