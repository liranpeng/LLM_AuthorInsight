T and q, we are unable to determine if its photochemical
module is similar to another model. Moreover, with climate-
varying T and qâ€™s the modeled reactivities from an observed
data stream will also be too noisy for an analysis of the top-

Summary discussion
We develop a new protocol for merging in situ measurements
with 3-D model simulations of atmospheric chemistry as cal-
culated by chemistry-transport models through to Earth sys-
