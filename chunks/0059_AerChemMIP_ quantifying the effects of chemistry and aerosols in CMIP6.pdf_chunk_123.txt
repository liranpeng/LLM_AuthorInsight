teractive chemistry and aerosols as the model conﬁguration
contributing to AerChemMIP, this will be the same control as
in RFMIP. The TOA radiative ﬂuxes from this control are ex-
pected to be very similar to the climatology from the coupled
pre-industrial control. However, this extra simulation ensures
consistency with the ERF deﬁnition and with RFMIP.
The perturbation experiments are run for 30 years follow-
ing the control, using the same control SST and sea ice, but
