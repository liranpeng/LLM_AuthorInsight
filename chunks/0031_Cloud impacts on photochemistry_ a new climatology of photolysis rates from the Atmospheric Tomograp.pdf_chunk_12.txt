chemistry as well as air pollution (Kim et al., 2015). For
the most part, these chemistry models are provided with the
cloud properties and fractional coverage for each grid cell
in a column, make some assumptions about the overlap of
cloud layers, and then solve the 1-D plane-parallel radia-
tive transfer equation at varying levels of accuracy. In a 3-D
world, however, adjacent clouds can block the sun or scat-
ter light even when there are clear skies overhead. Also in a
