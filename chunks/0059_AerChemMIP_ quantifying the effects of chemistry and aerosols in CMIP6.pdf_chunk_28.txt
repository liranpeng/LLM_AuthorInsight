to the CMIP5 archive. ACCMIP combined the results from
chemistry–climate models (CCMs) and ofﬂine chemistry
transport models (CTMs) to quantify the central estimate and
range of historical and future ozone and aerosol forcings, air
quality, and the contributions of individual ozone precursor
emissions. Surface ozone diagnostics in ACCMIP were used
to evaluate CCM ability to match current air quality episodes
and predict future ones (Schnell et al., 2015, 2016). NTCF
