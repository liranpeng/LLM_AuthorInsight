ship is not signiﬁcant for the MOPITT 700 hPa level.
The time series of August MOPITT CO columns for both
the North Atlantic and Alaska, regions that show high vari-
ability, show a small but signiﬁcant temporal correlation
with summertime Siberian biomass burning (r = 0.52 for the
North Atlantic and r = 0.59 for Alaska). Slightly lower val-
ues are seen for the 700 hPa MOPITT level. The time se-
ries of August MOPITT 700 hPa CO shows an increase in
