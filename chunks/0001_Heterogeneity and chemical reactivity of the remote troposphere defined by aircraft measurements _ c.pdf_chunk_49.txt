models that calculate the CH4 and O3 reactivities. We choose
the key reactive species (H2O, O3, CO, CH4, NOx, NOxPSS,
HNO3, HNO4, PAN, CH2O, H2O2, CH3OOH, acetone, ac-

alkenes, C2H2, C5H8, benzene, toluene, xylene, CH3ONO2,
C2H5ONO2, RONO2, and CH3OH) directly from the ATom
measurements and then add corollary species or other obser-
