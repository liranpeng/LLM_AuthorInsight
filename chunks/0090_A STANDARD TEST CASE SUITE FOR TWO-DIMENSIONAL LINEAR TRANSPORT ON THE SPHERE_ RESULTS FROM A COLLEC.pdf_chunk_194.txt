companying “correlated” mixing ratio ξ, are advected sep-
arately. The latter is related to the former initial condition
through a non-linear (polynomial) relation (black curve on
the scatterplots; Figs. 11, 12, 13, and 14). For any Eulerian or
semi-Lagrangian scheme known to the authors, scatter points
will deviate from the pre-existing functional curve as the
simulation progresses. In a purely Lagrangian scheme with
no explicitly added mixing (for example, contour surgery)
