mixing ratios of O3 by between 1 and 3 ppb. The differences in the
ER values between 2025 and 2050 are predominantly due to the
changes which occur across the different transport sectors (c.f.
Table 2), where the NTS component remains almost constant.
Compared to 2025 the maximal ER values decrease by w0.1 and the
area of exceedence falls to w31% of the total regional area shown.
Therefore, although the increase in the number of grid cells for
