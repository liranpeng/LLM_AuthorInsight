climate simulation data that is available to build climate pa-
rameterization schemes, while high-fidelity datasets based
on high-resolution and/or multi-scale climate simulations are
rare. Therefore, there is a clear need to investigate the possi-
bility of building schemes that take advantage of the abundant
low-fidelity data in order to improve high-fidelity parameteri-
zations. In addition, although several machine learning-based
methods have been successfully developed in order to pa-
