The typical physiotherapy interventions applied in ankle 
fracture rehabilitation are generally not adapted towards 
the needs of older adults [35]. It is not uncommon for 
elderly patients to suffer from mobility and balance prob-
lems and tailoring physiotherapy interventions towards 
these limitations, as opposed to routine ankle rehabilitation 
exercises, can enhance their functional capacity [35â€“37]. 
This represents a wider issue across the current studies
