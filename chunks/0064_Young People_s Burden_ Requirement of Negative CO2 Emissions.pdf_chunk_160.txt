questration has potential to store 0.7 PgC yr−1. However, as
with carbon storage in forest, there is a saturation effect. A
commonly used 20-year saturation time (IPCC, 2006) would
yield 14 PgC soil carbon storage, while an optimistic 50-year
saturation time would yield 35 PgC. Use of biochar to im-
prove soil fertility provides additional carbon storage of up to
0.7–1.8 PgC yr−1 (Woolf et al., 2010; Smith, 2016). Larger
industrial-scale biochar carbon storage is conceivable, but
