layer, conserving total cloud water (average clouds); and
(iii) decreasing the cloud fraction and cloud water in a layer
by using a reduced cloud fraction, f 3/2 followed by aver-
aging across the layer (Briegleb, 1992). These methods are
compared with cloud-overlap models in Sect. 3. Here, we fo-
cus on how the ICAs differ across cloud-overlap models.
2.1
Random overlap
The ways in which fractionally cloudy layers can overlap is
shown schematically in Fig. 1. One assumption is random
