snow and ice, have the potential to slow near-term warming, but uncertainties in coincident
emissions of reﬂective (cooling) aerosols and poorly constrained cloud indirect eﬀects confound
robust estimates of net climate impacts. Reducing sulfate and nitrate aerosols would improve air
quality and lessen interference with the hydrologic cycle, but lead to warming. A holistic and
balanced view is thus needed to assess how air pollution controls inﬂuence climate; a ﬁrst step
