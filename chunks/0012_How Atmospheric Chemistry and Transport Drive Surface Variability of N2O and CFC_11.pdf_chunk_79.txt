Figure 3.  Surface N2O change (ppb/yr) composites centered on the QBO phase transition at 40 hPa based on a rescaled 
tropospheric abundance of 320 ppb. Composites show the mean QBO surface impact throughout the overlap period 
(years 2001–2016*; six standard QBO cycles) for each respective data set. Simulations (top panel and bottom left) are 
of N2OX (zero emissions), while the NOAA ESRL observations (bottom right) are of surface N2O (with emissions).
