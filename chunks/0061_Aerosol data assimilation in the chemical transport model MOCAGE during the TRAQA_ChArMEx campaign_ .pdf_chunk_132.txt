ties in the modelled aerosol ﬁelds.
In doing so, our assimilation system showed to be more
efﬁcient in lowering overestimated AOD values in the model
than increasing underestimated values. This can be seen in
Fig. 1, and it is directly related to how matrices B and R
are deﬁned in the experiment. By deﬁning variances as the
percentage of modelled and observed quantities, and mak-
ing this factor 2 times smaller for observations, we penalized
