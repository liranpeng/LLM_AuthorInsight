surements of key species to initialize the models’ calcula-
tion of reactivity in each parcel and thus provide an observed
climatology of the chemical reactivity of the troposphere.
This approach moves us towards an understanding of which
species exert the largest inﬂuence on the atmosphere and thus
which are most crucial for us to establish a global climatol-
ogy.
