the pre-industrial conditions (e.g. in histSST-piNTCF); there-
fore AerChemMIP speciÔ¨Åes a time-evolving monthly SST
and sea ice distribution taken from a coupled historical ex-
periment. The impacts of different approaches for specifying
SSTs and sea ice on the total ERF over the satellite era have
been estimated to be small in one climate model (Forster et
al., 2016).
For models with interactive chemistry, piClim-NTCF and
piClim-aerO3 are identical and only need to be run once. For
