Evaluating models versus observations
The observational metrics used here are (i) monthly zonal
mean stratospheric column ozone (SCO), (ii) monthly aver-
aged ozone proÔ¨Åles in the stratosphere, and (iii) daily geo-
graphically resolved total column ozone (TCO) following the
evolution of the Antarctic ozone hole. To avoid confounding
potential errors in the stratosphere with those in the tropo-
sphere, we take the uncommon approach of comparing only
