ξ, respectively. First and third columns are for the unlimited schemes, and second and fourth columns are for the shape-preserving schemes.
The ﬁrst two columns are for simulations at 1λ ≈1.5◦, and the last two columns are for 1λ ≈0.75◦. The scheme acronym is shown in the
lower left corner of each scatterplot with the maximum Courant number (CN) appended. Above the scheme acronym the mixing diagnostics
(“real” mixing ℓr, range-preserving unmixing ℓu, overshooting ℓo) are given.
