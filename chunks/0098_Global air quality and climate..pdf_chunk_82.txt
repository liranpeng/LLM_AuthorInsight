many cases, the underlying driver of these strong relationships
is variability in synoptic conditions (e.g., ref. 190 and 191). For
example, over the eastern United States and Europe, observa-
tions demonstrate that extreme air pollution (O3 and PM2.5) is
typically associated with air stagnation events.190,192â€“198 As
described below, both modeling and observational analyses
suggest an exacerbation of air pollution in a warmer climate,
