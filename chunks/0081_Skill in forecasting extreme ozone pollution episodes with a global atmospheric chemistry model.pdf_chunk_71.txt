inventory (Hoor et al., 2009), and do not account for daily,
weekly, or monthly cycles. Because the surface O3 simula-
tion has not been optimized, the CTM performance described
below may be similar to chemistry–climate models that are
used for present to future scenarios.

Evaluating the central tendency of O3 in models
Many global chemistry models, including the UCI CTM, pre-
