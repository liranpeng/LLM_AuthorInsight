E39/C
Impacts by road and ship trafﬁc were provided by DLR
based on simulations with E39/C. The perturbation ﬁelds
are derived as monthly mean values from a transient sim-
ulation from 1990 to 1999 (Dameris et al., 2005; Grewe,
2007). The meteorology is calculated by the climate model
ECHAM4.L39(DLR) and therefore does not represent an in-
dividual year. Nevertheless, it represents the late 20 cen-
