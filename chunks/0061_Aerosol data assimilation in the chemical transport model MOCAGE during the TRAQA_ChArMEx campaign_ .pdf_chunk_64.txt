rial geostationary orbit and at a longitude of 0◦. We sample
the SEVIRI AOD every hour, and only use data over water,
since the retrieval over dark surfaces is usually more accu-
rate. The nadir horizontal resolution is 3 km, while over Eu-
rope it is ≈5 km, and we average the SEVIRI AOD data that
fall within the same modelled grid box.
