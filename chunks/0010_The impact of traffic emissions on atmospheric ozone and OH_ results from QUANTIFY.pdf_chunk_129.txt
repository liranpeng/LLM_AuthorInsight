latitudes over Europe is as high as over the eastern subtrop-
ical Paciﬁc. Thus the increasing ship trafﬁc at high northern
latitudes as a response to the diminishing ice coverage due
to the relatively rapid climate change (Lemke et al., 2007,
IPCC) might have strong effects on the oxidation capacity
and enhance surface ozone in the Arctic summer by a factor
of 2–3 (Granier et al., 2006).
Similar to ozone, aircraft emissions have the largest effect
