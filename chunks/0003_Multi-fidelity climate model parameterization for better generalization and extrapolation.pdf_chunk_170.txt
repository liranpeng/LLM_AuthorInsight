SF-HF-RPN is more capable of resolving the heat convection stochasticity and is only able of better resolving the moisture
convection stochasticity for vertical levels below the 494hPa one, while it struggles to do so for higher levels.
As observed for the heat convection parameterization, the seasonality effect on the models performance is not quite trivial.
Indeed, for the vertical level 259 hPa the temporal variations of the SF-HF-RPN and deterministic NN. testing errors show
