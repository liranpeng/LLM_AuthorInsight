the end of the nineteenth century (Figure 2) (Nicewonger et al., 2018, 2020). In contrast, the CO ice core
record indicates increased biomass burning emissions around the late‚Äê1800s, consistent with the temporal
trends found in the charcoal proxy record. The exact cause of the differences between the ice core acetylene,
ethane, and methane records with the CO record has not yet be determined (Nicewonger et al., 2018, 2020)
