identified.
When comparing different climates, convolutional variational autoencoders identify two distinct signatures 
of global warming: (1) an expansion and (at the atmosphere’s boundary layer) an intensification of “Shallow 
Cumulus” Convection and (2) an intensification and concentration of “Deep Convection” over warm waters. We 
argue that the first signal contributes to distribution shifts in the enigmatic “Green Cumulus” mode of convection.
