provides for a more balanced assessment in this paper. We also added 
information from assessments87,88 that derived agricultural emissions 
as the difference between atmospheric terms and other emissions 
such as combustion, industry and nature, and they gave comparable 
magnitudes (4.3–5.8 Tg N yr−1) to our bottom-up results.

Current data analysis and synthesis of long-term N2O fluxes are based 
on a wide variety of top-down and bottom-up methods. Top-down
