tion of climate–chemistry–aerosol interactions? How well do
models reproduce the observed spatial distribution and his-
torical evolution of NTCF concentrations, depositions, opti-
cal properties, and observable interactions with climate?
To guide the diagnostic process, the data request is struc-
tured according to overarching analysis subjects. These are
detailed in the subsections below: Climate response, Forc-
ing, Feedbacks, Chemistry–climate interactions, Air Qual-
