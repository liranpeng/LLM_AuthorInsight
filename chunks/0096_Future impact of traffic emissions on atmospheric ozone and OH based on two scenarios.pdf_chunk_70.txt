in the distribution of emissions contribute to these enhance-
ments since both AIR and SHIP show particularly large emis-
sion increases at lower latitudes (Fig. 1), where solar ra-
diation is stronger and water vapour levels are higher. For
ROAD, however, the large reduction in road trafﬁc-induced
OH concentrations, discussed in Sect. 3.2, causes this traf-
ﬁc sector to induce only minor changes in methane lifetime
