and 294 K; the quantum yields, at 248 and 298 K; and the
choice of whether to interpolate linearly or logarithmically,
or whether to extrapolate or not, affects J-NO2, especially
in the upper troposphere). This ambiguity does not exist for
J-O1D recommended cross section and quantum yields. J-
O1D is strongly dependent on the overhead O3 column, and
the zonal mean total O3 column from the models is compared
with recent satellite measurements in Fig. S3. NCARâ€™s O3
