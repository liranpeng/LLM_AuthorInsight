model (GCM) applications (RRTMG-SW). Solar-J success-
fully matches RRTMG-SW’s tropospheric heating proﬁle in
a clear-sky, aerosol-free, tropical atmosphere. We compare
both codes in cloudy atmospheres with a liquid-water stratus
cloud and an ice-crystal cirrus cloud. For the stratus cloud,
both models use the same physical properties, and we ﬁnd a
systematic low bias of about 3 % in planetary albedo across
all solar zenith angles caused by RRTMG-SW’s two-stream
