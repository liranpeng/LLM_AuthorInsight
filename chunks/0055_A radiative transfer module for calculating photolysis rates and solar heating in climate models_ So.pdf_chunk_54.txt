(CAM version 4.0 and prior versions). According to the
documentation in RRTMG-SW, Key’s parameterization was
taken from the Mie-calculated spherical shapes of ice parti-
cles from the Streamer radiative transfer codes (Key, 2002)
and thus should be similar to the Solar-J approximation. The
two-stream solution to the radiative transfer problem, as im-
plemented in RRTMG-SW, requires that the scattering op-
tical depth (τscat) be reduced with what is described as the
