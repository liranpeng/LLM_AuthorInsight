exist an unlimited version, the unlimited data are marked as
“NO DATA” or “−1”.
The tests are grouped into six categories assessing the fol-
lowing:
1. numerical order of convergence using smooth Gaus-
sian hills initial conditions,
2. “minimal” resolution using cosine bell initial condi-
tions,
3. ability of the transport scheme to preserve ﬁlaments
using cosine bells,
4. ability of the transport scheme to transport “rough”
distributions using slotted cylinder initial conditions,
