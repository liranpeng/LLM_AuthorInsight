culations but for an objectively selected sub-sample of the atmospheres therein based on the cloud distribu-
tions (Partitioned Gauss–Legendre Quadrature). This exciting approach shares many features with Solar-J 
QCAs (used for ICAs within a single cell), such as producing small rms errors relative to random sampling.
7.  Ocean Surface Albedo
Climate models often assume that the ocean surface albedo (OSA) is constant in the visible, typically 0.06
