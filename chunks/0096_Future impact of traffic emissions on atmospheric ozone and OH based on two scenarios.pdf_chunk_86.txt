is a considerable spread between the models (see Holmes
et al. (2011) for a discussion of RF uncertainties when
modelling aviation NOx), the uncertainty is mostly induced
by the large spread of emissions between the various sce-
narios (Lee et al., 2010), whereas the ensemble mean O3
RF is 61 (± 14) mW m−2 for the A1B scenario and only
19 (± 6.8) mW m−2 for B1 ACARE in 2050, just slightly
higher than in 2000 (18 ± 3.6 mW m−2). However, it should
