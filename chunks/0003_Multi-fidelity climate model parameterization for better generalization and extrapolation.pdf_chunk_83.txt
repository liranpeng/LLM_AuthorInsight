networks since a sequential training would put more weight
and importance on the second network fθHF,j (blue network
in figure 1.b) as it will be trained after the fit of network fθLF,j
(red network in figure 1.a), which is then held fixed. We
observed that a sequential training favors converging to a MF-
RPN model that is nearly identical to the SF-HF-RPN model
since the last learning step in fitting the MF-RPN model is
nearly identical to the SF-HF-RPN model’s learning of the
