the most reactive air parcels in terms of tropospheric produc-
tion and loss of the greenhouse gases ozone and methane.
Presupposing that we can accurately measure atmospheric
composition, we examine whether models constrained by
such measurements agree on the chemical budgets for ozone
and methane. In applying our technique to a synthetic data
stream of 14 880 parcels along 180â—¦W, we are able to iso-
late the performance of the photochemical modules oper-
