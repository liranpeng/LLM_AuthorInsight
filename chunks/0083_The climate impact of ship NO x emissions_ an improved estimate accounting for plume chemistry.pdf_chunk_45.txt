and a narrow strip in the Indian Ocean, as seen in Fig. 4. The
largest O3 enhancements are displaced eastward relative to
the emissions in each ocean basin, as found in previous stud-
ies, reﬂecting cumulative downwind production (Endresen
et al., 2003; Eyring et al., 2007). Figure 3 compares the
zonal-mean O3 column enhancements across the three plume
chemistry simulations. The pattern is similar in the instant
dilution and parametric plume simulations and this justiﬁes
