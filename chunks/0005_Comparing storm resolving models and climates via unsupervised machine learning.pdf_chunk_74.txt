making a synthesis of data across DYAMOND data generations Â­challenging54.
To preprocess the input, we follow these steps: we convert the 4D vertical velocity data from the DYAMOND 
GSRMs into 2D input samples of horizontal width and vertical level. To do this, we extract the 2D instantaneous 
subsets that are aligned in the pressure-longitude plane. This allows for a direct comparison with the MMF, which
