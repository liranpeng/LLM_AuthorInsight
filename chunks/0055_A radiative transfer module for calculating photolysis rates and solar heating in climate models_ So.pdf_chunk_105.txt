tend up to an SZA of 80◦but are largest of course at twilight.
The high-latitude atmosphere will have SZAs greater than
80◦for much of the day, and thus RRTMG may lead to a
cold bias for the high latitudes.

Low-level marine stratus cloud
For the stratus cloud, the liquid-water path (LWP, g m−2) in
each layer is derived from the LWC and height of each layer
(Table 3) and is plotted versus altitude in Fig. 4a as described
in Sect. 2.3. The resulting cloud optical depth in each layer,
