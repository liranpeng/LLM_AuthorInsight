tion, with a prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) that has
been augmented by 4 K and 8 K, referred to as +4K and +8K
simulations respectively, were considered as LF data candi-
dates for training. A comparison of their inputs and outputsâ€™
distributions with those of the SPCAM5 training data shows a
more pronounced extrapolation regime for CAM5 +8K data,
mainly due to the increased holding capacity of moisture in
the atmosphere with climate change (Clausius-Clapeyron) at
