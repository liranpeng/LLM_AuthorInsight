via convection in the models.
The sensitivity of ozone perturbations related to ship emis-
sions is more complex. In the lower northern hemisphere tro-
posphere NOx-levels are generally found to be higher than in
the tropics or southern hemisphere. Therefore the northern
hemisphere troposphere responds most sensitively to small
scale perturbations of the ship emissions.
The sensitivities deduced from p-TOMCAT are most
likely at the higher end and differences between both ap-
