Evaluating chemistry–climate models
A wide range of model estimates exists for regional air quality
both at present and in the future, even along a given emission
trajectory (Fig. 3–6). Growing record lengths of historically
observed relationships between relevant meteorological vari-
ables and air quality provide useful information for evaluating
models (e.g. ref. 194, 205, 226, 311–314) and may also help to
improve our understanding of the links between air quality
