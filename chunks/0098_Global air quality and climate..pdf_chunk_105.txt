study, however, shows that observed correlations of tem-
perature and water vapor with sulfate, nitrate, and organic
carbon largely reﬂect their co-variation with synoptic trans-
port rather than these direct impacts.190 While warmer
temperatures should reduce the partitioning of gas phase
secondary organics into the aerosol phase, e.g., ref. 202, they
may also increase the biogenic contribution to PM.187,243,244,270
SOA formation pathways are strongly inﬂuenced by climate as
