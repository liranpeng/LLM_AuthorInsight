2 %, collectively, although the water vapor effect is about 3
times larger. Halogen-driven decreases in stratospheric ozone
also shortened the lifetime about 1 %. Increases in ship and
land anthropogenic NOx emissions both decrease τCH4×OH
by 1.5 %, despite the ship source having much smaller to-
tal magnitude. Lightning NOx could also have an important
impact on τCH4×OH, but the lightning trends are not known.
The total τCH4×OH change from 1980–1985 to 2000–2005
