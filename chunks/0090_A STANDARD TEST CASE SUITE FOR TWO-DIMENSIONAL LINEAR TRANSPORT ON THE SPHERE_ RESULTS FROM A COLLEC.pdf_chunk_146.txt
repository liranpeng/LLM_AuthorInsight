(1992) where both the advection test and shallow water to-
pography (test 5) use C1 functions for mass distribution and
surface height, respectively.
Basically, the modelers repeated the numerical conver-
gence test (Sect. 3.1) with cosine bell initial conditions. The
“minimum” resolution is deﬁned as the resolution (speci-
ﬁed in terms of average grid spacing at the Equator) for
which the normalized ℓ2 error norm is approximately 0.033.
This threshold was chosen based on CSLAM experiments for
