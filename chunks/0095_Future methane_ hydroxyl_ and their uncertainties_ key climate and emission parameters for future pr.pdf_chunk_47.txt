where ci,t is the concentration at site i in month t. The global
MCF decay rate is the average of ki,t across sites within a net-
work. We calculate uncertainty in the global decay rate as
the 16th–84th percentile range (i.e. ±1σ) of ki,t across sites
within a network. No ﬁlling is used for months with missing
data. (See Supplement for additional method details.) Aver-
aged over 1998–2007, the global MCF decay rates from the
