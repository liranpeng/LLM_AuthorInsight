model intercomparisons that calculate budgets in large tropo-
spheric blocks like Voulgarakis et al. (2013) with 63 % of L-
CH4 in 31 % of the air mass (500 hPa–surface, 30◦S–30◦N).
The impact of the extremely hot parcels and the heterogene-
ity seen in the ATom 10 s parcels is evident in the steep slopes
above the 90th percentile, yielding enhancement factors of 3
to 4.
Each R value and each ocean has a unique shape; for ex-
ample L-O3 in the Atlantic is almost two straight lines break-
