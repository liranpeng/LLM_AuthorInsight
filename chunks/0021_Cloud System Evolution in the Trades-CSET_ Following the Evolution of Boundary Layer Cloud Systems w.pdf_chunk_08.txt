patches of shallow cumuli in very clean environments. Ultra-clean layers observed frequently near 
the top of the boundary layer were often associated with shallow, optically thin, layered veil 
clouds. The extensive aerosol, cloud, drizzle and boundary layer sampling made over open areas of 
the Northeast Pacific along 2-day trajectories during CSET is unprecedented and will enable 
modeling studies of boundary layer cloud system evolution and the role of different processes in
