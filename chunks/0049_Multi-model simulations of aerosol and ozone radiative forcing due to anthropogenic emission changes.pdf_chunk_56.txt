ﬁve models, excluding CESM-CAM5 and ECHAM, are
shown in Fig. 6b. CESM-CAM5 and ECHAM both have di-
rect aerosol effect very close to the model mean. All ﬁve
models have a positive total aerosol effect at the end of
the 1990–2015 time period, but the magnitudes vary sub-
stantially from near zero to +0.2 W m−2. The direct aerosol
effect causes part of this spread, but the aerosol–cloud in-
teraction is the major cause. Using the ECLIPSE emission
