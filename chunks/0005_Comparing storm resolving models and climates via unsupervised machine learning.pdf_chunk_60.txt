two trends as the climate changes: (1) “Green Cumuli” will become more frequent over larger swaths of semi-
arid continents in the future and (2) when “Green Cumuli” occur, they will be even more intense. Unsupervised 
machine learning models here proved capable of isolating rare-event “Green Cumuli” and capturing its climate 
change signals, synthesizing dynamic analysis and allowing new discovery.
