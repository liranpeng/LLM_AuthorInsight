The Oslo CTM3 chemical mechanism includes a full
stratospheric chemical mechanism in addition to tropo-
spheric reactions. The tropospheric module contains 105 re-
actions and 51 gas-phase species, including sulfate, nitrate,
and sea-salt aerosols. Nitrate aerosols inï¬‚uence gas-phase
chemistry through HNO3 uptake, which is a sink for reac-
