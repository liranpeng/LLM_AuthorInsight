could also simply use a reconstruction function based on
tracer mass ρφ instead of reconstructing ρ and φ separately.
However, shape preservation should only be applied to φ as
φ is conserved following parcel trajectories and not tracer
mass ρφ. Hence the separation of ρ and φ in the reconstruc-
tion step is preferable.

Flow-dependent dimensional splitting
Instead of approximating the upstream area with a fully two-
dimensional approach, it may be approximated using a di-
