transient response, i.e. that the CH4 concentration may not
be in steady state with the OH change during the simula-
tion year, we have applied factors based on the method de-
scribed in Grewe and Stenke (2008). For the A1B scenario in
2025/2050, these factors are 0.77/0.74 for AIR, 0.85/0.88 for
SHIP, and 1.07/1.77 for ROAD. The factors for ROAD are
larger than 1 because of the decline in emissions from this
transport sector in the years prior to the simulation year.
