ture atmospheres may be a cause of the different evolution
of tropospheric O3 and CH4, and lead to different chemistry-
climate feedbacks across the models.

Introduction
The daily passage of sunlight through the lower atmosphere
drives photochemical reactions that control many short-lived
greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other pollutants. This daily
cycle occurs across a range of different chemical composi-
tions; such that even neighboring air parcels can exhibit a
