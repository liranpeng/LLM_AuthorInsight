Uncertainties and unresolved issues remain. Although QP
provides a measure of the cell-averaged data, it still lacks
a formal uncertainty estimate. The decade analyzed here
(2000â€“2009) has an apparent trend in O3 concentrations
driven at least in part by reductions in precursor emis-
sions (Turner et al., 2013). For climate statistics, this non-
stationary pattern needs to be recognized and if possible cor-
