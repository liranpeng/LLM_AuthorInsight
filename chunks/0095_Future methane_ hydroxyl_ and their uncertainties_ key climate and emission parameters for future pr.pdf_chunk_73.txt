Granier et al., 2011). Therefore, these factors have little im-
pact on τCH4×OH variability during the 13-yr CTM simu-
lation, but are important on multi-decadal time scales and
longer.
Many of the sensitivity terms in Table 2 – speciﬁcally, wa-
ter vapor, CH4 abundance, and anthropogenic land NOx and
CO – are consistent among the CTMs and with past estimates
(Prather et al., 2001; Fiore et al., 2006; Hoor et al., 2009;
Myhre et al., 2011), suggesting a good understanding of how
