(ssp370SST-
ssp126Lu) in AerChemMIP (Sect. 3.2.2) parallel the full cli-
mate land-use perturbation (ssp370-ssp126Lu) in LUMIP. If
the same model conﬁgurations are used for both, this will al-
low direct quantiﬁcation of the efﬁcacy of land-use changes.
We recommend that the AER CHEM conﬁguration with
AerChemMIP diagnostics be used for the C4MIP 1 % yr−1
CO2 RAD and BGC experiment in order to explore fully
