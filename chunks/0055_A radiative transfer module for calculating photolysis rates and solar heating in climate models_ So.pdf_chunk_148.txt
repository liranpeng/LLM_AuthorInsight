heating rates but very large root mean square (rms) errors:
e.g., ±105 W m−2 in surface heating with an SZA of 45◦;
±3 K day−1 in layers with partly cloudy atmospheres (Pincus
et al., 2003). It is cost efﬁcient in that each wavelength bin re-
quires only one ICA calculation. Solar-J uses cloud quadra-
ture, introduced by Neu et al. (2007), selecting up to four
cloud proﬁles (QCAs) based on total optical depth to rep-
resent four types of atmospheres: mostly clear, typical cir-
