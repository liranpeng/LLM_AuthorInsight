increases in percent with SZA, but the pattern is different
from that of RRTMG-SW models. At overhead sun, Solar-J
has about the same CRE percent as EC92 even though it has
a 1.7 times greater τ. This can be understood in that Solar-
J cirrus is highly forward scattering and less of the scattered
light is reﬂected backward and upward. As the SZA increases
to 21–62◦, however, the peak in backscatter at 180◦becomes
less important and Solar-J shifts lower relative to EC92 to
