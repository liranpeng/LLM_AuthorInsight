Figure 4.  Correlation coefficients between surface N2O residuals (NOAA N2O minus modeled N2OX from Figure S2) 
and Niño 3.4 index at each latitude for years 2001–2016. The offset represents the lag between residuals and the Niño 
3.4 index (i.e., −12 offset = N2O residualJan2000 vs. the Niño IndexJan2001). Before the residuals were calculated, the
