(e.g., ref. 8) or dynamically downscaled meteorology (e.g.,
ref. 219 and 220).
Approaches (1) and (2) provide valuable process-level
relationships that can be used to evaluate the present-climate
simulations in the modeling systems under Approach (3).
Caution is needed when applying air pollution relationships
with meteorological variables on small spatial scales to project
air quality responses to future climate change since the sensi-
