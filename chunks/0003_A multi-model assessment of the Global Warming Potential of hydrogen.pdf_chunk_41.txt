uncertainties. To estimate the uncertainties in the GWP100 value
to 2.8, we have performed a standard error propagation using
model ensemble values and published literature values (as
detailed in Methods and Table 1). The largest uncertainty in
the estimate of GWP100 of hydrogen is the soil uptake, which is
also the largest term in the hydrogen budget, accounting for as
much as 80% of the loss of hydrogen4,5. If all other factors were
known with full certainty,
it alone would contribute
an
