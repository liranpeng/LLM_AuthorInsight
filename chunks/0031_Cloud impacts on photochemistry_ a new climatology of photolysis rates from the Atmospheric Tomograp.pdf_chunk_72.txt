to clouds than J-O1D is.
treme fractions are consistent with at least four of the mod-
els. Any possible CAFS bias in rlnJ due to TUV modeling
(±0.05) is unlikely to affect these results. These extreme
fractions, however, are likely sensitive to any sampling bias
of ﬂight path with respect to thick cloud decks, and this needs
to be assessed with model sampling that matches the ATom-1
proﬁles of that period.
The large geographic blocks were chosen to acquire repre-
