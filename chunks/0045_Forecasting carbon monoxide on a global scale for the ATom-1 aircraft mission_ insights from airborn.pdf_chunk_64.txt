mainly driven by Southern Hemisphere BB. CO is slightly
lower between 30 and 60◦N compared to that over the tropi-
cal Atlantic and Greenland. The similarity between GEOS-5
and ATom-1 variability in neighboring points is due in part
to the vertical proﬁling, which places horizontally extensive
biomass burning layers in the model and presumably also the
atmosphere at the same point along the track.
