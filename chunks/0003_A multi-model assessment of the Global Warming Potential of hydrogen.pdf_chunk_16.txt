of chemical feedbacks that occur in emissions-driven simulations.
Results
The hydrogen budget. Figure 1 shows the hydrogen budget as
simulated by six models (GFDL, OsloCTM, INCA, UCI, UKCA,
and WACCM). The burden of hydrogen is close to 200 Tg (a)
and the total lifetime of hydrogen is 2.4 years (1.9–2.7 years
model range) (b). The chemical production and loss of hydrogen
