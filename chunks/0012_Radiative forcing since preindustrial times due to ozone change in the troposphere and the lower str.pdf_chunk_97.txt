increase in CO ranges from 10 ppbv in DLR E39C to over
90 ppbv in the NCAR MACCM, STOCHEM HadGEM1,
and UM CAM models. The location of the maximum in-
crease is within the Ô¨Årst 3 km from the surface in mid to high
northern latitudes, with additional, but smaller, local max-
ima in some of the models; ULAQ and CHASER yield an
additional local maximum in the upper tropical troposphere,
while STOCHEM HadGEM1, STOCHEM HadAM3, and
UIO CTM2 calculate local maxima in the lower tropical tro-
posphere.
