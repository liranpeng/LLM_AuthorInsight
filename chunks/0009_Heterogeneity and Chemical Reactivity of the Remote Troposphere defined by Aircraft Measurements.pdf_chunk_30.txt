pospheric chemical reactions. Thus, chemistry–climate as-
sessments seeking to understand past global change and
make future projections for these greenhouse gases have fo-
cused on the average tropospheric rates of production and
loss and how these reactivities are distributed in large semi-
hemispheric zones throughout the troposphere (Grifﬁths et
