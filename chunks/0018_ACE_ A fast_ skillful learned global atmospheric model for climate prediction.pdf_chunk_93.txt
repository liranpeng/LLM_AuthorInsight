for the results shown in the main body of the manuscript. In particular, neither of them use the surface
type fractions as inputs.
To show the impact of the “residual scaling” normalization choice described in Appendix H, Figure 13
shows the 1-step validation RMSE, 5-day RMSE and time-mean RMSE (RMSE-TMps) of surface
pressure and 5-day RMSE of USWRFtoa as a function of training steps. Not surprisingly since we
