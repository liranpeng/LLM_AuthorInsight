There were long stretches of these gaps (ﬂag = 4) and miss-
ing ﬂight data (ﬂag = 5) that resulted in critical ﬂight seg-
ments being ﬁlled with mean proﬁle data. These gaps are
caused by the lack of NO2 rather than NO measurements as
shown in Fig. 49 (four ATom deployments multiplied by two
ocean basins). The number of proﬁles with NO data but no
NO2 data (red dots) is extensive and covers some key regions
(e.g., the lower troposphere in the Atlantic in ATom-2 or the
