Notes:
Radiative forcing and adjusted forcing from the ACCMIP results (Shindell et al., 2013) are given for all well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHG), ozone, aerosols, and the net. Original 90% confidence 
intervals have been reduced to 68% confidence to compare with the CMIP5 model standard deviations in Table AII.6.10. Some uncertainty ranges (*) are estimated from the 2100 RCP8.5 results
