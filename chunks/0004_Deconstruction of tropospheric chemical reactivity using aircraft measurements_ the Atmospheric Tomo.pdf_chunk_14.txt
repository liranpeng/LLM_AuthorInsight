lifetime of tropospheric O3 and the CH4 chemical feedback.
Overall, we hope to use the 10 s parcel statistics (> 140 000
parcels in ATom) to build performance metrics for CCMs.

Reactivities
Our interests in the reactivity of air parcels or model grid
cells began with P2017 and continued with P2018 and
G2023. We focused on the budgets of O3 and CH4 and now
add CO. Reactivities are deÔ¨Åned by a few key reaction rates.
Loss of CH4 (L-CH4):
