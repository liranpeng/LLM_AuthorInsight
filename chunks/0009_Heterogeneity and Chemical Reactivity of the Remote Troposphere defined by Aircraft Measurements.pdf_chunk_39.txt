with high reactivity; for example, 10 % of the parcels pro-
duce 25 %–35 % of total reactivity over the oceans. We com-
pare these ATom-1 statistics, species and reactivities with
August climatologies from six global chemistry models. In
one surprising result, ATom-1 shows a more reactive trop-
ical troposphere than found in most models’ climatologies
associated with higher NOx levels than in the models. Sec-
tion 5 concludes that the ATom PDs based on 10 s air parcels
