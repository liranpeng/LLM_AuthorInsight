is FCT (ﬂux-corrected transport by Zalesak, 1979) where a
monotone low-order ﬂux is blended with the non-monotone
higher order ﬂux to provide a shape-preserving solution. An-
other approach that can be used in the context of a ﬂux-form
discretization is to ensure that the reconstruction function,
which is usually an integral part of a ﬁnite-volume scheme,
is constrained so that it does not introduce new extrema or
expand the range of the cell-averaged values. This method
