column is anomalously lower only in the 20◦S–20◦N region
and likely explains their higher J-O1D noted above.
Reactivity proﬁles for the ﬁve non-GISS models show ex-
cellent agreement for P -O3 but noticeable differences for L-
CH4 and even larger ones for L-O3 (Fig. 1). The altitude
proﬁles are similar for the ﬁve models, indicating that the
cause of the L-O3 spread is likely related to HOX. The GISS
results are anomalous, with much higher P -O3 and an L-O3
