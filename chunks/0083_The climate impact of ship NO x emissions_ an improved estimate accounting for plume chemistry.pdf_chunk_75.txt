between sulfate and nitrate components. The aerosol direct
RF from ship NOx is therefore only 2 % of the O3 and CH4
RF. Aerosol indirect effects, black carbon, and organic car-
bon also contribute to radiative forcing from ships (Eyring et
al., 2010) but are beyond the scope of this study of ship NOx.
Our global RF calculation using parametric plume chem-
istry is the Ô¨Årst to account for sub-grid-scale ship NOx chem-
istry. Being based on a single model, we are unable to es-
