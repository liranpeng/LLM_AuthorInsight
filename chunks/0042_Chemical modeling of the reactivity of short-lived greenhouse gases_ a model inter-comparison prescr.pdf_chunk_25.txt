is model dependent. All models begin with their own 3-D ini-
tialization data set that is used to restart a model simulation
beginning on 16 August. The speciﬁed air-parcel NOx, for
example, will be initialized as separate NO and NO2 abun-
dances by scaling the model’s restart values for NO and NO2
to match the speciﬁed parcel NOx. Similarly, a single value
for aromatics will be partitioned over benzene, toluene, and
xylene by models that resolve these species in accord with
