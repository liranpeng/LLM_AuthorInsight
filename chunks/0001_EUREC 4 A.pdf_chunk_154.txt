eddy ﬁeld derived from satellite altimetry (Pujol et al., 2016). Eddy contours are detected automatically by the TOEddies algorithm (Laxenaire
et al., 2018). The position of subsurface eddies (200 to 600 m deep) as identiﬁed from the eddy detection method (Nencioli et al., 2010)
applied to vector currents measured by SADCPs are shown by red circles. A subsurface eddy freshwater anomaly is indicative of South
Atlantic origins.
