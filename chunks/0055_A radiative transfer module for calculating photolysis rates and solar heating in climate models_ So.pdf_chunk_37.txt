radius (re), single scattering albedo (SSA), ratio of optical to
geometric cross section (Q), and the ﬁrst eight terms in the
expansion of the scattering phase function (A0:7) that include
the asymmetry parameter (g = A1/3).
For liquid water, we take the refractive index from FOR-
TRAN codes developed at the University of Wisconsin–
Madison by M. A. Walters for liquid water (NDXWATER:
Hale and Querry, 1973; Palmer and Williams, 1974; Down-
ing and Williams, 1975) and ice water (NDXICE, based on
