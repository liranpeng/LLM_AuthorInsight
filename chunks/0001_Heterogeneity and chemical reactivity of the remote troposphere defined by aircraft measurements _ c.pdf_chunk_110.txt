For L-O3 (middle row, Fig. 3) in the central Paciﬁc, ATom-
1 results match the throughout the 0–12 km range (except
GISS). Moving to the eastern Paciﬁc and Atlantic, most mod-
els show a mid-level peak above 2 km, while ATom-1 shows
an even larger peak for L-O3, especially in the eastern Paciﬁc
at 3–6 km where L-O3 > 4 ppb d−1. This mid-tropospheric
peak is evident in the curtain plots of Fig. 2 and likely due to
