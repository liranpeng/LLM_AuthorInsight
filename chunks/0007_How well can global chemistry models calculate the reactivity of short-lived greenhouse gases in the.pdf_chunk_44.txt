ments of the lower troposphere. GFDL has the most compact
distribution of parcels and GISS, the most scattered. Four
models (GSFC, GC, NCAR, UCI) have remarkably similar
patterns in terms of the percentiles and structure, e.g., for
L-CH4 vs. L-O3 they show the lower tropics dominating the
upper part of the distribution and the extra-tropics, the lower-
most points. GFDL has similar percentiles for P -O3 and L-
CH4, but a much smaller spread for L-O3 that explains their
