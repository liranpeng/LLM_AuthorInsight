and well within the plausible range of 3.0–10.4 Tg(N) yr−1
(Corbett and Koehler, 2003; Endresen et al., 2007, 2003;
Eyring et al., 2005b). GEOS-Chem also includes ship emis-
sions of SO2 (8.5 Tg(S) yr−1; Eyring et al., 2005b), CO
(1.1 Tg yr−1; Wang et al., 2008), and VOCs, although ship
CO and VOCs are small compared to other sources of those
gases. We quantify the effects of ship emissions by compar-
ing a simulation with the base inventory to one with a uni-
