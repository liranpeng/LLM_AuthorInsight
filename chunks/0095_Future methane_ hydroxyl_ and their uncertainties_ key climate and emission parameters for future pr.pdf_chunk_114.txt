carlo realizations of future methane abundance in RCP 8.5,
sampling over the uncertainties in all parametric factors and
forcing variables in Eq. (3), as well as uncertainties in the
present-day methane budget.
Table 4 summarizes the predicted changes in climate and
emissions in RCP 8.5. In this scenario most anthropogenic
emissions of ozone precursors decrease by 2100 (7â€“75 %),
although aircraft NOx emissions rise 123 %. Biomass burn-
