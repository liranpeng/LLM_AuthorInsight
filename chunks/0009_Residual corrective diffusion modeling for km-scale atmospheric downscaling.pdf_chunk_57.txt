depend more than others on the diffusion step for their skill (see
Fig.Â 1). Moreover, it could be possible to apply the diffusion step to
a mean prediction obtained in a different way (e.g. a numerical
model if available) to generate a plausible distribution from a single
prediction.
With the current hardware and code-base CorrDiff inference is
about 652 times faster, and 1310 times more energy efficient than
running WRF on CPUs, although such a comparison between
