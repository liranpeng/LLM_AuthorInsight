of these diﬀerent eﬀects is model dependent. In contrast,
Leibensperger et al.108,109 found little warming due to BC over
the US and suggested that BC emission controls in the US
have little climate mitigation potential. The large uncertainty
of the net impact of BC mitigation on surface temperatures
reﬂects uncertainty in co-emitted species as well as cloud
feedbacks.86–88,110
Regional temperature responses to aerosol forcings have
been examined in a few studies. One study suggests that
