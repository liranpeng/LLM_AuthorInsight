Monthly chemistry diagnostics from each model enable
us to calculate τCH4×OH, deﬁned as the total atmospheric
CH4 burden divided by its loss through reactions with tro-
pospheric OH. All 3 models use ﬁxed methane abundances
(1760 ppb for UCI CTM and Oslo CTM3, 1775 ppb for
GEOS-Chem), so variations in τCH4×OH are due solely to
changes in the OH sink. Different tropopause deﬁnitions in
the models have minimal effect on τCH4×OH since CH4 oxi-
