task of radar channel synthesis. Several case studies reveal that the
model is able to downscale coherent structures consistently across
its variables. Focusing on a midlatitude frontal event, horizontally
co-located gradients of winds and temperatures are generated
alongside spatially consistent radar reflectivity features, with
incomplete but improved sharpness. For typhoons, encouraging
partial corrections of typhoon size and wind speed intensity are
