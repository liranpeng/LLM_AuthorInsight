probably not inconsistent. LZL attribute these errors to the correlation of gas and cloud absorption, but our 
results show that a significant component of the error is simply the failure to separate the highly scattering 
wavelengths from the partly absorbing wavelengths and is not tied to water vapor absorption. This informa-
tion may help in the development of a combined gas-liquid-ice model. Improving the accuracy of the gase-
