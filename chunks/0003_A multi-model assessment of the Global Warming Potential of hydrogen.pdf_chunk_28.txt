monthly three-dimensional kernel for ozone radiative forcing28 in
the two perturbation experiments relative to the control run. This
results in a total ozone ERF of 0.40 (0.28–0.48) mW m-2
per Tg yr−1 of hydrogen ﬂux (yellow bars).
In the stratosphere, hydrogen increases water vapor produc-
tion. We have calculated the radiative forcing for stratospheric
water vapor ofﬂine, using separate radiative transfer schemes for
longwave
and
shortwave
radiation,
