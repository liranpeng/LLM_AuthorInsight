impacts on reactivity.
A test of A- vs. C-runs for all six CTMs–CCMs is shown
Fig. 3. All models were spun up for a year and stopped at
00:00 UT on 16 August, with the chemical abundances at
this time being used to initialize each model’s own C- and
A-runs. In this case all species in the model were initialized
and not just the 18 key species. Each model ran their own
chemistry and meteorology intended to simulate a speciﬁc
historical year or a typical climate year. All were intended to
