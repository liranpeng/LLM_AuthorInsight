state calculation will match the integrated transient. A major
advantage of assembling the GWP from the component terms is
that each term represents a fundamental response of atmospheric
chemistry to the hydrogen and methane perturbations, and we
can compare these across models. Further, from the model range
in individual terms we can assess and identify uncertainties in
each, allowing us to propagate an uncertainty in GWP that is
more than just the range in model GWPs. A notable disadvantage
