with a Studentâ€™s t test using 10 years of data for the 2090s (RCP 8.5) and present-day simulations. Note the different scales for (i) UM-CAM
and STOC-HadAM3 and (ii) CMAM and GISS-E2-R.
Previous studies have attributed similar CO-tracer changes
to changes in tropopause height (Fang et al., 2011), which
is a robust feature of greenhouse gas warming (e.g. Kang
et al., 2013) and shown by all four CCMs.
Following Fang et al. (2011), we elucidate the role of
