error (RMSE) between SEVIRI observations and MOCAGE di-
rect/assimilation model run for the western Mediterranean during
the TRAQA campaign between 25 June and 13 July 2012. The mean
number of SEVIRI observations per hour is also given. The statistics
correspond to Fig. 3 with the observations localized in the region 0–
10◦E, 35–45◦N (marked in Fig. 5 by the grey box).
