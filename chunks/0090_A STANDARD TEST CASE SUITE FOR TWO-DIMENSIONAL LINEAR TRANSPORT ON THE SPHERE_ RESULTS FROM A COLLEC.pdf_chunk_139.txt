see Eq. 24 in LSPT2012), especially for schemes allow-
ing for long time steps (CN > 1) such as (semi-)Lagrangian
schemes. CSLAM, for example, was run with CN = 1.0 and
CN = 5.5. It is observed that as the time step is reduced
with CSLAM, the absolute errors increase since an increased
number of remappings implies increased spatial errors until
the distribution can be represented by the polynomial recon-
struction functions (Fig. 1, row 1 and 2). Since the CSLAM
