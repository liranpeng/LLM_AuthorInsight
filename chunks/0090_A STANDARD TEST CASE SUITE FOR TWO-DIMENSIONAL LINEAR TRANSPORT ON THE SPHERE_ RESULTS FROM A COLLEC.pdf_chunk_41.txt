spect to air mass ﬂux.
It is worth noting that Eq. (6) with m = 1 constitutes a
form of linearization of the ﬂux where non-linear coupling
between tracer mixing ratio and air mass is neglected. For ex-
ample, assume that tracer mixing ratio φ(x,y) is represented
through a higher order polynomial of degree K and similarly
for air density ρ(x,y), where x and y denote the longitu-
dinal and latitudinal directions, respectively. Then the ﬂux
through the cell wall involves ⟨φ(x,y) · ρ(x,y)⟩(Dukowicz
