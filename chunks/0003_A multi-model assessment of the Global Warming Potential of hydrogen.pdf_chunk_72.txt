hydrogen. The difference in the ﬂux between PERT_CH4 and CTRL is the ﬂux
needed to sustain the 10% increase in methane, and this ﬂux includes the feedback
factor. Both the methane and hydrogen feedback factor can be calculated as the
perturbation lifetime divided by the total lifetime. The increased concentration of
methane in PERT_H2 that would have occurred (at equilibrium) if it had not been
held ﬁxed (e.g.43,) is then calculated by combining the change in surface con-
