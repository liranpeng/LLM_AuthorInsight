All models with stratospheric chemistry calculate a signiÔ¨Å-
cant reduction in the stratospheric ozone burden. Most mod-
els group around a stratospheric ozone reduction of 20 DU
between the tropopause and 30 km, which seems to be rea-
sonable, taking into account that the assumed 1850 strato-
spheric ozone is similar to ozone levels in the 1970s, and
the ozone column decrease between 1980 and 2000 observed
by ozonesondes and satellites between 10 and 30 km is near
