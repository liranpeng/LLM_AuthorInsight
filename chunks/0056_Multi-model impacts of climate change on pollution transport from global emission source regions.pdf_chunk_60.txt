(Fig. 5).
Note that the CO-tracer mixing ratios in this study are
higher than those reported by Fang et al. (2011) since we use
a longer lifetime of 50 days rather than 25 days. CO-tracer
mixing ratios are typically lower than modelled or observed
real CO (which is usually more than 100 ppb over source re-
