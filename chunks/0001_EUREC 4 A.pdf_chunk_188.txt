Figure 19. Global 2.5 km mesh simulations performed by ICON as part of DYAMOND-Winter for the EUREC4A period. The snapshot, with
a magniﬁcation over the study region to show the degree of detail in the simulations, was taken from 2 February of a simulation initialized
on 20 January and allowed to freely evolve thereafter.
