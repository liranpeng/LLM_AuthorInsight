training datasets, it is always challenging to disentangle the different extrapolations contribution on the models errors. Given
the heterogeneous temporal variations of the SF-HF-RPN and deterministic NN. errors for different seasons across different
vertical levels, it is not straightforward to draw conclusions on the seasonality effect on these models performance.
Figure 11 shows the temporal variations of testing MAE and R2 for moisture tendency and different surrogate models at
