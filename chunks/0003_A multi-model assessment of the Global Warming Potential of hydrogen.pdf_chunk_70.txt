Radiative forcing calculations. Because methane is held Ô¨Åxed in PERT_H2, the
experiment with 10% increase in methane surface concentrations (PERT_CH4)
allows us to estimate the impact of hydrogen on surface concentrations of methane.
From CTRL and PERT_H2 we directly diagnose the loss of methane through the
CH4 + OH reaction, and the lifetime of methane due to OH, combined with a
