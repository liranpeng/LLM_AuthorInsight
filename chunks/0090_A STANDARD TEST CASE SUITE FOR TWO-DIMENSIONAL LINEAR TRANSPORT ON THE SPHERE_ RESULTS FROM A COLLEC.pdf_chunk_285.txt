and scalar value, φj. We employ Cartesian coordinates for
the Lagrangian parameter and position. The particles are ad-
vected in the ﬂow,

using fourth-order Runge–Kutta, with initial condition
xj(0) = αj. The total scalar is computed by I(φ) ≈

i=1 φiAi, where φi is the scalar value at the center of panel
Pi and Ai is its area. To maintain accuracy, a remeshing
scheme is applied at regular intervals. At a remeshing step,
