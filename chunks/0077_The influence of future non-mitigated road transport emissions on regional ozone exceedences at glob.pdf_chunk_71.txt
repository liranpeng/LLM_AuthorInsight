5. Conclusions
In this study we have used a multi-model ensemble of large-
scale atmospheric chemistry models, which adopts the realistic
SRES A1B emission scenario and a “policy-failure” scenario (A1B
HIGH) for road trafﬁc emissions (RTE), to differentiate the effects of
unmitigated road trafﬁc emissions on regional air quality for
various global regions. Analysing the regional trends in RTE NOx
estimates provided in the pessimistic SRES emission scenarios,
