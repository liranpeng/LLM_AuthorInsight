‘Nitrogen deposition on land’ was the ensemble mean of an average 
of three inventories: FAOSTAT/EDGAR v4.3.2, GAINS/EDGAR v4.3.2 
and NMIP. FAOSTAT and GAINS documented the sector ‘Indirect agri-
cultural N2O emissions’ by separating estimates from nitrogen leach-
ing or nitrogen deposition, whereas EDGAR v4.3.2 did not. Here, we 
treated ‘Indirect agricultural N2O emissions’ from EDGAR v4.3.2 as 
‘Inland and coastal waters’ emissions for data synthesis. Only EDGAR
