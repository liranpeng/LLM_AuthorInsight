combined HCR and HSRL retrievals were used to estimate cloud boundaries for the flights 
flown (Schwartz et al., 2018).
To further complement the HCR and HSRL measurements, a 4-channel zenith-pointing 183 
GHz radiometer was flown to provide liquid water path (LWP) and water vapor estimates. 
This radiometer is similar to one used during the VOCALS project (Zuidema et al., 2012b). 
Such radiometers have the potential to provide an additional fundamental cloud observation
