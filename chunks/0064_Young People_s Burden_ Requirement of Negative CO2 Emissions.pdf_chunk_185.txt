have only two choices if it wants to stay below 1.5 ◦C of
warming. It must either deploy carbon dioxide removal on
an enormous scale or use solar geoengineering” (Parker and
Geden, 2016). While we reject 1.5 ◦C as a safe target – it is
likely warmer than the Eemian and far above the Holocene
range – Fig. 12 shows that fossil fuel emission reduction of
3 % yr−1 beginning in 2021 yields maximum global warm-
ing ∼1.5 ◦C for climate sensitivity 3 ◦C for 2 × CO2, with
