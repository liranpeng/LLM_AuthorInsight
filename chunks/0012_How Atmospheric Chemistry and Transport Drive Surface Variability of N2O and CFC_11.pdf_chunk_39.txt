be driven completely by stratospheric loss and atmospheric transport. If emissions are used to maintain the 
observed N2O, then the surface variability will also be determined by the location and magnitude of those 
emissions, confounding the stratospheric signal. Resetting lower-boundary N2O to observations does not 
get around this constraint since it is effectively a surface source. To isolate the stratospheric N2O signal,
