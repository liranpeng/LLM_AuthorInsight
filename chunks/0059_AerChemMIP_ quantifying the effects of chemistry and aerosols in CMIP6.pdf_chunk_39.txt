Science questions
This section provides the scientiﬁc justiﬁcation for the four
science questions that AerChemMIP will address. As a
multi-model exercise, AerChemMIP will identify areas of
consensus and disagreement in the answers. Owing to the
strong connection between clouds and aerosols (Boucher et
al., 2013), AerChemMIP will provide crucial information
to support the World Climate Research Program (WCRP)
