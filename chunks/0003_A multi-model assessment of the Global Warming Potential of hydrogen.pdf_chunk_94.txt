perturbations from the initial hydrogen pulse will have decayed, and the steady-
state calculation will match the integrated transient. For AGWP20, however,
perturbations tied to methane will still exist after 20 years, and the steady-state
approximation is corrected using the time scale of the methane perturbation (see
Supplementary Table 8).
Uncertainty calculations. To estimate uncertainties in the GWP value, we use
equation (7) and perform a standard error propagation. We are speciÔ¨Åcally
