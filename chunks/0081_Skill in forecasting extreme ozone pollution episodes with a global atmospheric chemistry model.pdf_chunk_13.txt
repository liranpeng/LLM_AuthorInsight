we generate an objective measure, the quality of prediction
(QP), for the mapping of each cell (i.e., how many indepen-
dent points were used and how far away they are). This grid-
cell product has the added advantage of allowing direct and
commensurate comparison of independent sets of overlap-
ping but not collocated observing sites, and we examine the
biases between the two European ozone networks (European
Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) and Air-
