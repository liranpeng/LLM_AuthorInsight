tograms for NOx shown in Fig. 4. Over 0–12 km (ﬁrst row),
ATom has a reduced frequency of parcels with 1–10 ppt and
a corresponding increase in parcels with 20-60 ppt; this dis-
crepancy is ampliﬁed in the lower troposphere, 0–4 km (sec-
ond row). The obvious source of this oceanic NOx is light-
ning since oceanic sources of organonitrates or other nitrate
species measured on ATom could not supply this amount.
The ATom statistics indicate such a lightning source must be
