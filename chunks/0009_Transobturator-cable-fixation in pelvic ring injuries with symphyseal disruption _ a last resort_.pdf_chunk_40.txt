vasorum are more laterally. However, in trauma contexts with
symphyseal gapping, anatomical structures might be unexpectedly
positioned. Therefore, minimal invasive cable placement without
visualization and identification of the mentioned anatomical structures
should be avoided. Further, the cable will likely be prominent in the
retrosymphyseal space, potentially causing irritation of the bladder.
