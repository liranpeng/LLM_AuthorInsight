means, as well as the Mie-derived values for Q, SSA, and g.
The relative importance of cloud heating in each bin can be
estimated by multiplying the solar energy by the absorbing
fraction, SWatt×(1−SSA). One ﬁnds that absorption for bins
S1–S20 is negligible, that both types of clouds and strato-
spheric sulfate aerosols have large absorption in bins S25–
S27, and that ice-water clouds have large absorption per op-
tical depth in bins S21–S24 while liquid-water clouds do not.
