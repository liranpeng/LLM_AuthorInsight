with internal parameters (Scinocca and McFarlane, 2004)
that cause this large difference in magnitudes across the four
CCMs.
The spatial patterns of convective mass ï¬‚uxes averaged
over the lower to upper troposphere (800 to 300 hPa) high-
light the zonal symmetry of deep convection across the ITCZ
and depict the seasonal migration of the ITCZ within the
subtropics (Figs. 8 and 9). Hence, as discussed in Sect. 3.1,
the large CO-tracer mixing ratios over equatorial and Central
