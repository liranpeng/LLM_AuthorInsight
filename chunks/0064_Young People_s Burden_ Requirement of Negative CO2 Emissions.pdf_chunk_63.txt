through 2016 of Fig. 28b of Hansen et al., 2005, which are
consistent with estimates of Myhre et al., 2013, in the most recent
IPCC report, IPCC, 2013). Forcings are based on observations
of each gas, except simulated CH4-induced changes of O3 and
stratospheric H2O included in the CH4 forcing. Aerosols and
