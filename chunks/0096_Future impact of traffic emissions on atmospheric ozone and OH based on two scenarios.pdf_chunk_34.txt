for addressing impacts of e.g. emission policies in the fu-
ture (Grewe et al., 2010). Furthermore, Myhre et al. (2011)
found that the non-linear response of a 5 % perturbation com-
pared to a 100 % removal of the emission category is small
compared to the inter-model differences in RF. This implies
that the calculated sensitivities are robust, i.e. the calculated
ozone change per changed mass in emissions is rather in-
dependent from the considered change in emission of either
