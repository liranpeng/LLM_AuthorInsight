models. The other three (SAM, SPCAM, ICON) deviate from the larger group in their representations of the 
intensity, type, and proportions of tropical convection. These divergences temper the confidence with which we 
can trust GSRM simulation outputs. Note we cannot rule out the possibility that one of the divergent GSRMs may 
still be reflecting observational reality better than the majority group. We leave this comparison to observations 
for future work.
