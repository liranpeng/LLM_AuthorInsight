with an accuracy of ±0.01 for a range of wavelengths (Hol-
ben et al., 1998). We use all available L2 data from differ-
ent stations, and interpolate these data in logarithmic space
to 550 nm (to harmonize wavelengths between different sta-
tions and with the model) by using available neighbouring
wavelengths: 440, 500, 675 and 870 nm.
