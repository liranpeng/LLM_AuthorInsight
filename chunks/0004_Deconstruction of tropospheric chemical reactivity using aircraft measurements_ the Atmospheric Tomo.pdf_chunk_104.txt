ATom-1 are given in Table 2. The mean sensitivities are cal-
culated using basin-wide averages and have only been calcu-
lated using one day’s cloud ﬁelds (day 223) instead of the ﬁve
days of different cloud ﬁelds (e.g., days 213, 218, 223, 228,
or 233) used for the reactivities in Sect. 3. Basin-mean dif-
ferences between two separated days (days 213 and 223) due
to cloud ﬁelds and ozone columns are evaluated and found
to be small: < 1 % of the value of S or smaller than 0.002 in
