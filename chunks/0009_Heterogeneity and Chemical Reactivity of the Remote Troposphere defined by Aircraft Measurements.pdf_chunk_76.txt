is why the median is less than mean (except for P-O3 in the
Atlantic). Each R value and each ocean has a unique shape;
for example L-O3 in the Atlantic is almost two straight lines
breaking at the 50th percentile. In Fig. 1 the agreement across
all models (except GISS) is clear, indicating that the con-
clusion in P2018 (i.e., that most global chemistry models
agree on the O3 and CH4 budgets if given the chemical com-
position) also holds for the ATom-measured chemical com-
