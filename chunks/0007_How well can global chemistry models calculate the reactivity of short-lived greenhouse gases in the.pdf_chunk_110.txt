average for identifying model–model difference. The pro-
tocol also makes several simplifying assumptions that may
affect results: the solar declination over the month is ﬁxed
at the mid-month value; and the 24 h integration is always
started globally at the same universal time, meaning at dif-
ferent local solar times across the longitudes. These issues
were tested with a single model and found to be unimportant
compared with the synoptic variability in clouds and other
