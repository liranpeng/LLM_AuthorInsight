cause some VOC species are not simulated in all models.
Lightning NOx emissions also differ between models be-
cause they are calculated from underlying meteorology, as
described below.
Table 1 summarizes emissions of key species. We use
the RCP inventory for anthropogenic emissions for year
2000, repeating in each simulated year (Lamarque et al.,
2010; van Vuuren et al., 2011). This inventory provides
monthly gridded emissions of NOx, CO and speciated VOCs
