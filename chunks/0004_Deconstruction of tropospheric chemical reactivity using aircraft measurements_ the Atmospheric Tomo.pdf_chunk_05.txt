ATom’s regular proﬁling of the ocean basins allows for weighted averages to build probability densities for the
key species and reactivities presented here. These statistics provide climatological metrics for global chemistry
models, e.g., the large-scale pattern of ozone and methane loss in the lower troposphere and the more sporadic
hotspots of ozone production in the upper troposphere. The proﬁling curtains of reactivity also identify mete-
