which is probably connected with convective upward trans-
port of enhanced tropospheric ozone and ozone precursors.
The calculations show that there are differences between the
models as to the spatial variation of ozone increase and to
its peak magnitude. However, common to all models is a
pronounced near-surface increase in ozone in mid- to high
northern latitudes, reï¬‚ecting the location of the main an-
thropogenic emission sources. There is some disagreement
