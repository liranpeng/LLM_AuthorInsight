crease. Their conclusion that increasing tropical precipitation
and temperature may be major factors driving CH4 growth
suggests the possibility that the slow climate-methane am-
plifying feedback might already be signiÔ¨Åcant. There is also
concern that global warming will lead to a massive increase
in CH4 emissions from methane hydrates and permafrost
