port of pollution from major emission source regions, in par-
ticular from biomass burning regions in the tropics that are
strong CO sources, and how this effect varies seasonally as
governed by the seasonal location of the ITCZ and biomass
burning emissions sources. Furthermore, the key roles of re-
duced convection consistent with a weakened Hadley circu-
lation in winter and a higher tropopause in governing trans-
port changes are conÔ¨Årmed. Overall, a reduction in tropical
