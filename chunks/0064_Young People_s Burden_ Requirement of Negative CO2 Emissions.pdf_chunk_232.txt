The present analysis uses GHCN.v3.3.0 (Menne et al.,
2012) for land data and ERSST.v4 for sea surface temper-
ature (Huang et al., 2015). The update from GHCN.v2 used
in our 2010 analysis to GHCN.v3 had negligible effect on
global temperature change over the past century (see graph
at http://www.columbia.edu/~mhs119/Temperature/GHCN_
V3vsV2/). However, the adjustments to SST to produce
ERSST.v4 have a noticeable effect, especially in the pe-
