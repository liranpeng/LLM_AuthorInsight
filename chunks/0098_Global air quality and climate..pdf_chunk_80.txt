quantify these feedbacks with observational studies. A quali-
tative summary of several of these feedbacks is included in
Table 1 where we provide an assessment of the level of
conﬁdence in the sign of the response to rising temperatures,
along with the impacts of these climate-driven pathways on
surface O3 and PM. Finally, land-use changes have also been
shown to inﬂuence regional air quality by altering emissions
from the biosphere.186–189
