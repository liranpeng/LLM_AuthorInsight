Mixing diagnostics at ﬁxed resolution and “minimal”
resolution
An apparent ﬁrst question about the histograms in Fig. 15
(upper and middle) is whether the amount of “real” mixing
for the unlimited schemes decreases with increased “mini-
mal” resolution (1λm), which is used for the ordering of
the mixing data. In general that is the case; there is a gen-
eral trend for a monotonic decrease in ℓr going from left
