11 bins (177–291 nm) are optimized around the Schumann–
Runge bands of O2 and the Hartley bands of O3, and the
next 7 bins are optimized for tropospheric photolysis (291–
778 nm). The bins were chosen to have relatively uniform
opacities for the principal absorbing species O2 and O3
across the wavelengths in each bin. In some cases, this in-
cludes combining different wavelength regions on either side
of the O3 maximum cross section near 255 nm. Effectively,
