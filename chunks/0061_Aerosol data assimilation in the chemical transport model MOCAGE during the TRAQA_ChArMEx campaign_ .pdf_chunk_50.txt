rors and the spatial structure of the analysis. The background
error covariance matrix B is a matrix of size j × j, where j
is the size of the control variable. It can be represented as
B = 4C4T,

where 4 is the diagonal matrix of the square root of the vari-
ances, and C is the positive deﬁnite symmetric matrix of cor-
relations. In the case of the preconditioned cost function, the
matrix is formulated as
