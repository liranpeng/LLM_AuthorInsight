budgets.
Similar considerations also apply to the momentum bud-
get of the trades. In Dixit et al. (2020) idealized large-eddy
simulations are shown to underestimate the ï¬‚ux of momen-
tum in the sub-cloud layer, something they hypothesize to
arise from an absence of mesoscale circulations in the simu-
lations. As an example of efforts to quantify such processes

cloud layer by the long-range wind lidar aboard the R/V Me-
