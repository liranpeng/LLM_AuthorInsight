lies between that of the two groups in the upper troposphere
but becomes narrower in the boundary layers, more closely
matching that of Group 2. Given that a number of processes
can lead to broadening of the CAFS distribution, it is likely
the sharps peaks in Fig. 4 (and wide central lines in Fig. 5)
of Group 1 are unrealistic.
These model differences have no obvious, single cause.
The modeled proÔ¨Åles of COD and CF for both geographic
blocks are shown in Fig. S6 (note the logarithmic scale for
