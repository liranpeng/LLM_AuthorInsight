merging maximally overlapped groups that are correlated
with each other (MAX-COR), is deﬁned in Sect. 2, where the
impact of cloud-overlap models on photolysis rates (J val-
ues) is also shown. Cloud-overlap models generate statistics
that lead to a large number of weighted independent col-
umn atmospheres (ICAs), where the number is too large to
be used directly to calculate photolysis or heating rates in
global models. Section 3 looks at the simpliﬁed cloud models
