These patterns of skill are evident for both threshold choices
with correlations (R2) between them of 0.86 for the US and
0.87 for EU. The eastâ€“west gradient in EU, as well as the
lack of pattern in the US, can partly be understood from the
relationship between skill and QP. Low CTM skill is caused
by model errors as well as errors in observations and interpo-
lation. As shown in Fig. S5 in the Supplement, the CTM skill
is largest in grid cells with large QP and small interpolation
errors.
