as it is exchanged with higher oxides of nitrogen, but the
fraction of NOx in the form of NO is determined rapidly in
sunlight by Reactions (2a), (2b), (2c), and (4).
NO + O3 â†’NO2 + O2
(R4)
In the dark, NOx is almost entirely NO2, and it is critical to
initialize NOx, but not NO and NO2 separately.
Based on sensitivity tests with the UCI-CTM, our list
of 18 key species includes O3, NOx, HNO3, HNO4, PAN
(C2H3NO5 = peroxyacetyl nitrate), RNO3 (CH3NO3 and all
