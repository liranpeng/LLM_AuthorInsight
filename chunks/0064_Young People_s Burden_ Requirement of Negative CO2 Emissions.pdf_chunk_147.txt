human-made climate forcing. The scenarios that reduce CO2
to 350 ppm succeed in getting temperature back close to the
Holocene maximum by 2100 (Fig. 12b), but they require ex-
tractions of atmospheric CO2 that range from 153 PgC in the
scenario with 6 % yr−1 emission reductions to 1630 PgC in
the scenario with +2 % yr−1 emission growth.
Scenarios ranging from constant emissions to +2 % yr−1
emissions growth can be made to yield 450 ppm in 2100 via
