their share of biases. Potential solutions are to fine-tune on reanalysis data (e.g. [9]) or on a smaller
amount of high-resolution simulation data that has smaller biases [4]. Further improvements to our
current training regime that are possible, e.g. using appropriate constraints in the loss function [18]
to reduce global non-physical sources of moisture and mass. Finally, coupling to other components
