tures on surface climate) and globally integrated effects (e.g.
the lifetimes of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)).
Past climate change has been forced by a wide range of
chemically reactive gases, aerosols and well-mixed green-
house gases (WMGHGs), in addition to carbon dioxide.

and ozone abundances (also known as near-term climate
