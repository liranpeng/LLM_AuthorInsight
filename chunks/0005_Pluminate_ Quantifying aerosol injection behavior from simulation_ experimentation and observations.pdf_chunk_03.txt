predictions of our climate. Since the rate of spread of aerosols in a
marine environment directly translates to the effectiveness and
ability of aerosol injections in impacting cloud radiative forcing, it is
crucial to understand the spatial and temporal extent of injected-
aerosol effects following direct injection into marine environments.
