the past and future climate–composition interactions (includ-
ing unreactive greenhouse gases) in the CMIP6 chemistry–
climate models, we recommend that as many as possible
of the Tier 1 simulations of RFMIP (Pincus et al., 2016),
DAMIP (Gillett et al., 2016), ScenarioMIP (O’Neill et al.,
2016), C4MIP (Jones et al., 2016) and LUMIP (Lawrence et
al., 2016) are run with the AER CHEM model conﬁguration
and with AerChemMIP diagnostics.
