The GWP100 values for each component are provided in Sup-
plementary Table 6. In this study we report GWP100 as it is the
ofﬁcial emission metric for United Nations Framework Con-
vention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We have also calculated

and
GWP500
(3.31 ± 0.98) (Supplementary Table 8). By reducing short-lived
climate forcers (SLFCs), such as hydrogen, there is potential to
