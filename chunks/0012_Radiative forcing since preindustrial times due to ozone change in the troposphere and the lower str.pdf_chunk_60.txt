cally in the range of 20% to 40% (DLR E39C, CHASER,

All models show a higher near-surface
ozone concentration near the equator, which differently
extends to higher altitudes.
The Northern Hemisphere
extra-tropical troposphere (45 N–90 N, 0–8 km) is simulated
within ±30% (ULAQ and DLR) and ±10–20% (all other
models), generally being in better agreement than in the
