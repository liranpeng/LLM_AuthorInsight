∼1 ◦C global warming during that period. The effect of the
adjustments on total global warming between the beginning

Recent global warming rate
Recent warming removes the illusion of a hiatus of global
warming since the 1997–1998 El Niño (Fig. 2). Several
studies, including Trenberth and Fasullo (2013), England et
al. (2014), Dai et al. (2015), Rajaratnam et al. (2015) and
