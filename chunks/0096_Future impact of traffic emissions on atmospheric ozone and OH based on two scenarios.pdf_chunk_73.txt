with stratospheric temperature adjustment included. Monthly
mean ozone ﬁelds from each of the six models were used
for the calculations. An interesting ﬁnding is that the use
of a scaling approach, where the global average transport-
induced O3 column were multiplied with the normalized ra-
diative forcing (NRF; RF divided by the change in O3 col-
umn expressed in Dobson Units (DU)), introduced only mi-
nor changes in the results compared to carrying out complete
