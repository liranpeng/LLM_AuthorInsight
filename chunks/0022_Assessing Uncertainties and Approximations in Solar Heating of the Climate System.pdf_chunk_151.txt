use a stochastic cloud generator (e.g., Räisänen et al., 2004), and this drove the structure of our cloud over-
lap algorithm. MAX-COR was designed to be (i) deterministic, (ii) linear in cost with increasing numbers 
of layers, and (iii) robust when cloud data are averaged in time or space, because such averaging tends to 
eliminate cloud-free layers and revert to MAX overlap. Based on observations of decorrelation length (Kato
