an observation‐consistent tropopause for e90 using tropics‐plus‐midlatitudes and then apply it globally to calculate total tropospheric air‐mass and tropopause ozone values. The tropopause mixing barrier for the current UCI CTM is identified by a transition in the vertical transport gradient to stratospheric values of 15 days km−1, corresponding to an e90 tropopause at 81 ± 2 ppb with a global tropospheric air mass of 82.2 ± 0.3%. The best e90 tropopause based on sonde pressures is 70–80 ppb;
