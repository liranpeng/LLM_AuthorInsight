scenarios and assessing whether the generated weather
envelope appropriately reflects climate sensitivity,
particularly concerning extreme events.

Synthesizing sub-km sensor observations: To achieve effective
resolutions beyond what is possible to simulate today, and
sidestep issues of numerical simulation, it would be
interesting to test whether variants of CorrDiff can be trained
to generate raw senor observations where dense networks
