cal) emissions. For methane and ethane, the decline in emissions from the MP to LIA are 21–57% and 22–
35%, respectively. The ranges reﬂect the different constraints imposed by the geologic source strength and
atmospheric chlorine sink (Figure 3).
4.2. Is there a Single Preindustrial Fire History Consistent With Acetylene, Ethane, and Methane
Ice Core Records?
Emissions of acetylene, ethane, and methane from biomass burning are not equal by mass (i.e., not 1‐g acet-
