is close to the tropopause (e.g., e90-tropopause tracer, O3 levels of 120 or 250 ppb). They also agree with
the hemispheric ﬂuxes inferred from the O3 budget of the LMS. The simulated NH ﬂux across the 100 hPa
surface leads the NH O3 STE ﬂux in time by 2–3 months.
Using the stratospheric overturning circulation as quantiﬁed by the transformed Eulerian mean vertical
velocity w∗to calculate, or even act as a scalable proxy for, the STE O3 ﬂux, however, yields serious errors. For
