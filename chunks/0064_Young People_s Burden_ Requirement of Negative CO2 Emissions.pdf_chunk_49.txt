ture maximum (+0.5 ◦C) in about 1985. This conclusion is
supported by the accelerating rate of sea level rise, which
approached 3 mm yr−1 at about that date (Hansen et al.,
2016 show a relevant concatenation of measurements in their
Fig. 29). Such a high rate of sea level rise, which is 3 m per
millennium, far exceeds the prior rate of sea level rise in the
last six millennia of the Holocene (Lambeck et al., 2014).
Note that near stability of sea level in the latter half of the
