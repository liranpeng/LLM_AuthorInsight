ities (except GISS), and there is fairly good agreement with
the ATom-1 PDs. For the Atlantic (right columns, Fig. 5), the
models show a larger spread, presumably due to the differ-
ing inﬂuence of pollution from neighboring continents. The
ATom-1 Atlantic PDs also show slightly larger disagreement
with the models (e.g., the maximum in P-O3 at 1–2 ppb d−1
and minimum in L-O3 at 2–3 ppb d−1) and the notably higher
frequency of hot spots with L-O3 > 5 ppb d−1. The inﬂuence
