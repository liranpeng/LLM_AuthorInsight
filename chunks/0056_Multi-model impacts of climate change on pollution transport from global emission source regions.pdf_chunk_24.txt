5â€“10 % enhancements at the high percentile values of sum-
mer CO-tracer distributions in the United States to reduced
cyclone passage across southern Canada under a future 2050
climate compared to present day. Several other studies have
used idealised CO tracers emitted from continental sources
to investigate climate variability and change impacts on pol-
lutant transport (Shindell et al., 2008; Doherty et al., 2013;
Lin et al., 2014; Monks et. al. 2015). Using a regional CO-
