inﬂuence each bin. The increment could be weighted by dif-
ferent quantities, like number or mass concentration, or ex-
tinction coefﬁcient. The real contribution of different aerosol
types in the increment is unknown, and we can only rely on
the model information. In this way, all repartition weights
based on the model stay biased in a similar way compared
to the real repartition weights, regardless of the choice of the
repartition. Considering all possible choices and the charac-
