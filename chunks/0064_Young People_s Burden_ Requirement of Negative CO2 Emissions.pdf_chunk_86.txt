warming for 1880–2012 is 0.85 ◦C (range 0.65 to 1.06 ◦C). While
within that range, our value is higher because (1) use of 4-year
longer period, (2) warming in the past few years eliminates the ef-

hiatus, and (3) the GISTEMP analysis has greater coverage of the

The large climate response is a result of two amplifying feed-
