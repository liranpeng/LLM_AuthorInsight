statistical extremes of the ozone climatology and not as
air quality exceedances. With the University of California,
Irvine chemistry-transport model (UCI CTM) we ﬁnd there
is skill in hindcasting these extreme episodes, and thus iden-
tify a new diagnostic using global chemistry–climate models
(CCMs) to identify changes in the characteristics of extreme
pollution episodes in a warming climate.
