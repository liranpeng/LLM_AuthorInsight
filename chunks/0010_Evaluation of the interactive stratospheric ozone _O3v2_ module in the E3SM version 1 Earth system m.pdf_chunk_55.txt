SD of the zonal mean stratospheric ozone abundances relative to the MLS observations. (d) Daily Antarctic ozone hole diagnostics (Fig. 5)
relative to the NASA ozone watch data. Numbers 1 and 3 are for the daily mean time series, while numbers 2 and 4 represent the daily SD
time series. On all Taylor diagrams, the model SDs are normalized by dividing the SDs of the reference (labeled with units).
