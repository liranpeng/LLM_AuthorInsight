ERA5 dataset. We show the log-PDF to highlight the differences at
the tails of the distributions. Here wavenumber is the inverse of a
wavelength.

This is corroborated by analysis of probability distributions
(Fig. 1d–f) – for the radar reflectivity channel both the UNet and RF
fail to produce realistic statistics, but CorrDiff is able to match the
target distribution between 0 and 43 dbz while significantly
improving on the UNet (Fig. 1f). In contrast to the radar channel,
