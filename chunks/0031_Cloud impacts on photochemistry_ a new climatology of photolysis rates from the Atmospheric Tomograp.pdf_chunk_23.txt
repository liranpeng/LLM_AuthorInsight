clude incidences when the sky is effectively clear of clouds.
We designate these all-sky J values as J-cloudy in both
measurements and models to contrast them with the artiﬁ-
cially cloud-cleared J values denoted J-clear. For J-clear,
CAFS uses the Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible (TUV)
radiative transfer model (Madronich and Flocke, 1999). The
model is run with an eight-stream discrete ordinate radia-
tive transfer method with a pseudo-spherical modiﬁcation
