stratosphere only in connection with CH4 and N2O, not with
CO2.
The possibility of a true STE-driven IAV CO2 signal,
raised by Gaubert et al. (2019), has not been seriously in-
vestigated. For the most part, when studies investigate the
stratospheric inﬂuence on CO2 source inversions, they are
not concerned about STE ﬂuxes directly but other factors that
degrade the results: e.g., gradients across the tropopause, the
effective tropospheric air mass diluting surface emissions, or
