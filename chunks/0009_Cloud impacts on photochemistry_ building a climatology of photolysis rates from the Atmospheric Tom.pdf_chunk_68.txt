The top two rows in Fig. 4 give the fraction of samples for
which rlnJ > 0.3 on the right side of each plot; the bottom
row gives, on the left side, the fraction for which rlnJ < âˆ’0.3.
The categorization of models and measurements is not sim-
ple as many models have shifting magnitudes of this large-
scale brightening or dimming. A few models consistently
lack these large changes in Js (GC, GMI), and a few always
have them (NCAR, UCIb). Large CAFS values are clearly
