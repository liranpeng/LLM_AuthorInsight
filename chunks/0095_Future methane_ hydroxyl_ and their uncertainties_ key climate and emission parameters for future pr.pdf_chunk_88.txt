ﬂuence on τCH4×OH over the same tropical and subtropical,
where UV photolysis of tropospheric ozone is an important
primary source of tropospheric OH and where the quasi-
biennial oscillation is the dominant source of stratospheric
ozone variability. However, global-mean ozone columns are
strongly inﬂuenced by variability in the springtime polar re-
gions, so using global-average ozone columns signiﬁcantly
degrades the parametric model correlation with the CTMs
(R2 ≈0.75).
