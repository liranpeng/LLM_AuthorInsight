reducing sulfate for health reasons could lead to a rapid rise in
surface temperatures (e.g., ref. 4 and 5), possibly at rates
threatening the survival of some ecosystems.2 In the absence of
emission changes, a warming climate may degrade air quality in
many polluted regions,6,7 an impact that has been referred to as
‘‘a climate change penalty’’ on air quality.8 We review the current
understanding of the interactions between air pollutants and
