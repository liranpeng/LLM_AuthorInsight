regional deposition fluxes of both oxidised and reduced
nitrogen compounds for the present day and near future
(2030), using an ensemble of 23 models. These authors
calculated that 11% of the worldâ€™s natural vegetation
receives excess nitrogen through deposition, leading to
eutrophication of ecosystems as discussed above. The
emissions used in the study of Dentener et al. [2006] were
prescribed, and so the spread in model deposition fluxes
