at least 10 years (Figure 1). While there is some year-to-year variability, the seasonal cycle of both
of these fields is well represented by ACE. This result is dependent on choice of forcing variables,
the normalization strategy (Appendix H) and using the SFNO architecture which has been shown
to have favorable stability properties compared to Fourier Transform-based FourCastNet [3]. The
two prognostic variables whose global means drift unrealistically are the surface pressure ps and
