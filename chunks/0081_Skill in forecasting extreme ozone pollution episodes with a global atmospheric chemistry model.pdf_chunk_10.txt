tests of the ability of atmospheric chemistry models to sim-
ulate pollution episodes over the time- and space scales pos-
sible in a global model. In this study, we develop such diag-
nostics, speciÔ¨Åcally a grid-average climatology of daily sur-
face ozone concentrations, with a focus on CTMs that should
be able to simulate past events (hindcasts) using a meteo-
rology representative of the time of the observations (e.g.,
ERA-Interim or GEOS MERRA). The goal is to characterize
