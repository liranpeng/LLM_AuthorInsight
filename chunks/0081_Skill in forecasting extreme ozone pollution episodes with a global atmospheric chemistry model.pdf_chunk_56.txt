ferences (95th minus 25th, Fig. 4e–f). The percentiles here
are calculated with respect to years 2005 and 2006, since
these are to be compared with the CTM hindcast. The high-
est 95th-percentile values (∼70 ppb) occur in California and
then in a broad swath from Texas to New England. For EU
they lie mostly around the Mediterranean. The lowest 95th
percentiles occur in the northern latitudes for both the US
and EU. The 25th percentile represents clean air, typically
