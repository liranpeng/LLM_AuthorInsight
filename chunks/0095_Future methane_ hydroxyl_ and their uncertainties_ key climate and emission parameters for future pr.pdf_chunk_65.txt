m All anthropogenic NOx emission occurring on land, including combustion, agriculture, and waste.
deﬁned as
α = d ln(τCH4×OH)/d ln(F).
(2)
As such, α can be interpreted as the percent change in
τCH4×OH resulting from a 1 % increase in F.
Table 2 reports sensitivities for the evaluated climate and
emission variables. These variables include most of those
identiﬁed in the literature as important inﬂuences on tropo-
spheric OH and τCH4×OH variability: temperature, water va-
