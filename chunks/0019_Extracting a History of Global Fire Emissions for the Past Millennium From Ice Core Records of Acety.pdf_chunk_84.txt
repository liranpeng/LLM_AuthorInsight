ylene to 1‐g methane), and so comparing the inferred biomass burning histories of these compounds together
cannot allow us to answer the question of whether the ice core gas records indicate a single ﬁre history. A ﬁre
history (dry matter burned) can be derived from each of the trace gas emission histories as follows:
