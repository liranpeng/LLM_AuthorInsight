with the concentrations (for WMGHGs) or emissions (for
short-lived species) of the selected species set to present-day
(2014) values (Table 6). The WMGHG experiments should
allow as complete a representation of the chemical effects on
aerosol oxidation, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, and
stratospheric water vapour as the models are capable of. Note
that in this setup methane concentrations are Ô¨Åxed and do not
respond to changes in oxidation rate. The ozone ERF esti-
