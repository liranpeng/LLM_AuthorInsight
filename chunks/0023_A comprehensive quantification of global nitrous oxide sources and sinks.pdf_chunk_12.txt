Our assessment enhances understanding of the global nitrogen cycle 
and will inform policy development for N2O mitigation, which could 
help to curb warming to levels consistent with the long-term goal of 
the Paris Agreement.
A reconciling framework (described in Extended Data Fig.Â 2) was 
used to take full advantage of bottom-up and top-down approaches 
for estimating and constraining sources and sinks of N2O. Bottom-up 
approaches include emission inventories, spatial extrapolation of field
