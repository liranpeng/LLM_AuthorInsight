to the short OH lifetime of less than one second, the global
distribution of transport-induced OH (Fig. 4) reﬂects the lo-
cations of emissions, but is also strongly affected by incom-
ing solar radiation, the amount of water vapour, the levels of
background pollution, and the lifetime of the emitted species.
Furthermore, the ratio of CO to NOx emissions differs largely
between the three transport sectors. ROAD has the largest
ratio and thereby lowest OH enhancement efﬁciency, while
