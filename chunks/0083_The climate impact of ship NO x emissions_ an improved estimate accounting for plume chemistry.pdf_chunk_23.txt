constant effective emission factor obviously neglects diurnal,
seasonal, and regional inï¬‚uences on plume chemistry. In ad-
dition, using this method underestimates NOx concentrations
in ship tracks, since some NOx survives oxidation until the
plume has expanded to the global grid resolution. To redress
these shortcomings, Vinken et al. (2011) used a Gaussian
plume chemistry model to calculate the dilution and chem-
ical evolution of the exhaust over 5 h, at which point the
