and SAM) have qualitatively different ELBO score distributions than the remaining models. Panels (bâ€“g) 
show symmetrized KL divergences between DYAMOND models obtained through nonlinear dimensionality 
reduction and vector quantization (see main text). Panel (b) shows results obtained from K = 3 physically 
interpretable clusters while panel (g) shows the results from K = 50 in order to better approximate the true
