obtain skillful extrapolation predictions for unseen HF testing
data. We show that the proposed MF-RPN can provide the
best of both worlds: the higher accuracy of the HF data and
the generalization capability thanks to the LF one. The im-
proved MF-RPN skillful predictions are tested across various
error metrics on HF data of unseen warmer climate scenarios
and against three other surrogate models.
