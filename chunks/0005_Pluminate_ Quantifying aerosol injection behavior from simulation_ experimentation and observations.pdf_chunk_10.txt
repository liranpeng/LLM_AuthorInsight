directly translates to the effectiveness and
ability of aerosol injections in impacting cloud
radiative forcing, it is crucial to understand the
spatial and temporal extent of injected-aerosol
effects following direct injection into marine
environments. The ubiquity of ship-injected
aerosol tracks from satellite imagery renders
observational validation of new parameterizations
possible in 2D, however, 3D compatible data is
more scarce, and necessary for the development of
