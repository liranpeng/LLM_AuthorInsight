sis, we will use anthropogenic-only emissions to compute
the average anthropogenic fraction in transient simulations,
as compared to the pre-industrial reference in 1850. Some
emissions may include natural components, which may have
changed along with climate change, such as NOx from light-
ning and soil degradation and biogenic volatile organic com-
pounds. We therefore request total emissions for each species
for 1850 and 2014.
The 3-D Ô¨Åelds of mass mixing ratios also provide the ver-
