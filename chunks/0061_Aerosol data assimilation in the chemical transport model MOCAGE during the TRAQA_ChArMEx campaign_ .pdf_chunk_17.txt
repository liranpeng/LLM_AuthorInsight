uated independently against a large range of aerosol proper-
ties (2-D and 3-D) measured by other satellites and in situ
and ground-based instruments. We will estimate improve-
ments in the CTM modelling of all aerosol types achieved
by the AOD assimilation compared to a direct (unassimi-
lated) model run. One focus will be on the potential to im-
prove air quality forecasting. Another will be how the con-
tinuous multicycle AOD assimilation can inï¬‚uence the mod-
