polluted regions, high-O3 events correlate strongly with
temperature due to associations of temperature with stagnation
episodes, with enhanced photochemistry, and with biogenic
and wildﬁre emissions.5–8,186,195,200,221,223,228–232 Table 1 sum-

warming climate on surface O3 and distinguishes between
baseline surface O3 levels (deﬁned as those not inﬂuenced
directly by local emissions233) and local-to-regional (LR)
