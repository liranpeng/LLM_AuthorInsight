mate models are increasingly including short-lived gases and
aerosols as radiative forcing components, and the accurate
simulation of these under different climates requires some
level of interactive chemistry and photolysis rates.
The components of Solar-J are chosen and balanced to
achieve the best possible overall accuracy for a module in-
