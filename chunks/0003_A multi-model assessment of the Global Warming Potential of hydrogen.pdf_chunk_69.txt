create a smooth zonal ﬁeld. Zonal surface ﬁeld of methane is from input4mip41 for
year 2010. Anthropogenic emissions are from the Community Emissions Data
System (CEDS) (version 2017-05-18 as used in CMIP6) for year 2010 and biomass
burning as in CMIP642. Natural emissions are the models’ own choice.
The models have either run with meteorological ﬁelds or with nudged
meteorology. In GFDL, a higher perturbation is used due to weaker nudging. See
