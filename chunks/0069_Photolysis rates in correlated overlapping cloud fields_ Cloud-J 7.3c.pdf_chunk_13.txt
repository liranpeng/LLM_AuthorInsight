(Stamnes et al., 1988; Wild et al., 2000; Tie et al., 2003).
Thus, the only workable method (other than 3-D radiative
transfer) is to represent the FCA by a number of ICAs where
each ICA is either 100 % cloudy or clear in each layer. The
fractional cloud-overlap model determines the layer struc-
ture, weighting, and number of ICAs. Other simple cloud
models approximate overlap by (i) ignoring clouds entirely
(clear sky); (ii) averaging the cloud fraction, f , over each
