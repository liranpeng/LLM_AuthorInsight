and use (which is usually based on edible portions of feedstocks,
such as starch) is not inherently carbon-neutral; indeed, it is likely
carbon-positive, as has been illustrated in speciﬁc quantitative anal-
yses for corn ethanol in the United States (Searchinger et al., 2008;
DeCicco et al., 2016). The need for caution regarding the role of
biofuels in climate mitigation is discussed by Smith et al. (2014).
