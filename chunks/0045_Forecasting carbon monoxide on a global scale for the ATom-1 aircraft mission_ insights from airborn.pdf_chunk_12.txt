tributions (Ziemke and Chandra, 2003), and large biomass
burning (BB) events during El Niño years increase concen-
trations of trace gases including CO and CO2 (Langenfelds
et al., 2002). Biomass burning plays a particularly strong role
in driving the interannual variability of CO (e.g., Novelli et
al., 2003; Kasischke et al., 2005; Duncan and Logan, 2008;
Strode and Pawson, 2013; Voulgarakis et al., 2015). The im-
