3.2. Exceedence ratio for tropospheric O3
To assess whether the distribution of near-surface (0e500 m) O3
simulated by the model ensemble results in regional exceedences
of air quality standards, we use a method where we normalize the
monthly mean mixing ratios by the recommended 8-hourly limit
provided by the EC of 60 ppb exposure for a period of 25 days in any
