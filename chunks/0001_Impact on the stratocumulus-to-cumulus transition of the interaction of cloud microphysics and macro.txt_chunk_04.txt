boundary layer turbulence. Without the WTG, cloud-top height rises without a compensating adjustment in subsidence, delaying drizzle-induced stratocumulus thinning (“drizzle-depletion” feedback) by several days. With the WTG, intensified subsidence restrains cloud-top growth and accelerates stratocumulus thinning, leading to reduced boundary layer turbulence by weakened longwave cloud-top cooling and increased susceptibility to cloud breakup. For lightly precipitating clouds, aerosol injection
