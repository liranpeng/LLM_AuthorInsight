et al., 2011; Klimont et al., 2013). The available emission
data for various aerosol types differ in magnitude across re-
gions (Wang et al., 2014b). The net effect of these emission
changes in terms of changes in the Earthâ€™s radiative balance
is not obvious. In addition to a change in the geographical
location of the emissions that emphasises more chemically
active, low-latitude regions, different types of aerosols have
different impacts on the radiative balance. Some are purely
