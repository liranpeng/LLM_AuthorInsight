instrument (red) and by two models (UCI & NCAR) using regular sampling over the two geographic blocks:  (1, 
left) Tropical Pacific and (2, right) North Pacific.  The points represent the relative number of samples in each 0.10 
interval of cos(SZA).  ATom flights in this region were generally centered about noon, and hence CAFs has a higher 
proportion of high SZAs.  For most of the analysis here only J's with cos(sza) > 0.8 are used, and with this
