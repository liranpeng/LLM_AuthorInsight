Four decades of the global N2O budget
The atmospheric N2O burden increased from 1,462 Tg N in the 1980s to 
1,555 Tg N in 2007–2016, with a possible uncertainty of ±20 Tg N. Our 
results (Table 1) show a substantial increase in global N2O emissions 
that is primarily driven by anthropogenic sources, as natural sources 
remained relatively steady throughout the study period. Global N2O 
emissions obtained from our bottom-up and top-down approaches
