duction (warming) as well as hydroxyl (OH) production that
destroys methane (cooling). The net balance of these com-
peting effects is cooling for most ground-based NOx emis-
sion sources, including ships (e.g., Fiore et al., 2012), but can
be warming for aviation NOx (Holmes et al., 2011). Here,
we summarize all previous reports of methane and ozone ra-
diative forcing (RF) from ship NOx and then calculate an
