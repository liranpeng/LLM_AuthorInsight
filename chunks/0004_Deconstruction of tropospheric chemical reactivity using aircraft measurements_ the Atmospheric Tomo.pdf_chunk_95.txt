Southern Ocean reactivity proﬁles (Fig. 39) can be directly
compared with the Arctic (Fig. 37) since both use the same
axis scale. For L-CH4, they are almost identical (Southern
Ocean ATom-23 and Arctic ATom-14), and the differences in
L-CO are simply attributable to the smaller CO abundance in
the Southern Hemisphere. The O3 reactivities are much less
in the Southern Ocean, however, and there is no peak in P-O3
(1–2 ppb d−1) above 8 km as found in the Arctic. The Arctic
