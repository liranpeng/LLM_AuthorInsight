erties for examples of liquid-water clouds (re = 12 µm),
ice-water clouds (re = 48 µm, cold, hexagonal), background
stratospheric 70 wt % sulfuric acid aerosols, and volcanically
enhanced stratospheric aerosols for each Solar-J bin are given
in Table 2. This table gives wavelength data for the real
