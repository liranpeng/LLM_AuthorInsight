ing high O3 concentrations are changing with climate, we
must be able to characterize those AQX events observed to-
day and demonstrate that global chemistry models can repro-
duce them. As demonstrated for the UCI CTM above, sur-
face O3 concentrations in global chemistry models are often
biased high, with higher biases often occurring during peak
pollution episodes, but there is skill in hindcasting pollution
variability. These biases hinder the ability to predict AQX
