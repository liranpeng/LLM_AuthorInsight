increases water vapor concentrations there due to a much longer
lifetime than in the troposphere, causing a cooling effect in the
stratosphere and an increased greenhouse effect24.
Radiative forcing. Figure 3 illustrates and summarizes the radiative
forcing effects of increasing hydrogen. Each bar shows global mean
effective radiative forcing (ERF) due to one Tg ï¬‚ux of hydrogen, for
each model. Here, the model results are normalized by the change in
