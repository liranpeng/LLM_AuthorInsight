2%–4%. To reach equivalent accuracy for a single time step using random selection would require about 50 
ICAs each with full wavelength calculation (not as in McICA) versus an average of 2.8 QCAs (many grid 
cells have less than 4 QCAs).
The binary cloudy-or-clear within a grid cell fails to account for varying cloud thickness, and J. K. P. Shonk 
and Hogan (2008) invented the Tripleclouds algorithm to represent in-cloud heterogeneity with a thick
