we discuss the current range in modeling cloud effects and
how new observational constraints can be developed and
used to build better models.

Measuring and modeling J values under realistic
cloudy skies
Here, we focus on two J values: O3 + hv →O2 + O(1D)
designated J-O1D and NO2 + hv →NO + O(3P) designated
J-NO2. These J values are the most important in driving
the reactive chemistry of the lower atmosphere, and each
emphasizes a different wavelength region with response to
