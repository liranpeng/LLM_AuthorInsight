and (c) October means.
Figure A2. Pressure (10–1000 hPa) by latitude (90◦S–90◦N) October mean differences between the untuned O3v2 and O3v1 for (a) O3,
(b) temperature, (c) zonal wind, (d) PSC ozone loss tendency, (e) buoyancy frequency squared (N2), and (f) E–P ﬂux vector and divergence.
Results are averaged over the 5 years for which the untuned O3v2 had exceedingly weak ozone holes (1998, 2001, 2007, 2011, 2013). The
