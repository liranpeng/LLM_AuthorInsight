has a positive forcing in the periods 1995–2000 and 2005–
2010, with the forcing over the other 5-year periods being
negative or consistent with zero.
The model range for the direct aerosol effect due to
changes in sulfate concentrations is smaller than that for the
total direct aerosol effect; see Fig. 4a. The range for sul-
fate forcing is a factor of 2, slightly lower than the model
range from other recent multi-model studies (Myhre et al.,
