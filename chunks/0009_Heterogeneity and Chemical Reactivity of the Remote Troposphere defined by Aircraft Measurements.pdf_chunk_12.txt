relevant for tropospheric chemistry and the 24 h reactivities.
We limited our study to three reactivities (Rs) controlling
methane (CH4) and tropospheric ozone (O3) using speciﬁc
reaction rates to deﬁne the loss of CH4 and the production
and loss of O3 in parts per billion (ppb) per day. The critical
photolysis rates (J values) are also reported as 24 h averages.
L-CH4 : CH4 + OH →CH3 + H2O(1)
(1)
P-O3 : HO2 + NO →NO2 + RO
(2a)
RO2 + NO →NO2 + RO,
(2b)
where NO2 + hν →NO + O and O + O2 →O3
