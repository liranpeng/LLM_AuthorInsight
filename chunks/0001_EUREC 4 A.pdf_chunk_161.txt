measurements across an eddy near 11◦N, with anti-cyclonic currents (at −5 m) shown by vectors, in Region C. Panel (b) shows time series
of Tsea measurements by the different instruments. Probability density, p, of air–sea temperature differences measured by two SWIFT buoys
between 04:00 UTC 4 February and 14:00 UTC 6 February (c).
Ocean eddies, fronts, and ﬁlaments inﬂuence the atmo-
sphere by perturbing air–sea surface ﬂuxes (Chelton and
Xie, 2010; O’Neill et al., 2012) – a process that may
