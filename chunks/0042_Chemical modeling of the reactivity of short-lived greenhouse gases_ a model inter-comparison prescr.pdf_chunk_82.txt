erence case. UCI is typically higher and GSFC is lower. For
J-NO2 in these most reactive parcels, UCI is notably higher
as is GISS, a result seen in the average proﬁles (Fig. 1), but
it does not affect the reactivities. The mean bias of models
relative to the reference case is also seen in Fig. 7 with the
offset of the points. The results here are similar to what has
been identiﬁed earlier: GISS has unusual offsets for all re-
activities and J-O1D; agreement for P -O3 is much better
