of whose aims one is to minimise the negative impact of
nitrogen on the environment. The focus of the present work is
on oxidised nitrogen species; deposition of reduced nitrogen
species is also important, but is not considered here.

of nitrogen deposition. Holland et al. [1997] used five
models to examine global nitrogen deposition and its impact
