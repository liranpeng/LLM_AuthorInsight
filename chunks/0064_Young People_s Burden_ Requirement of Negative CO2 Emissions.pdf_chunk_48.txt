meaningful comparison. The trend line reduces the effect of
interannual variability, but the more important point is that
Earth’s energy imbalance assures that this temperature will
continue to rise unless and until the global climate forcing
begins to decline. In other words, we know that mean tem-
perature over the next several decades will not be lower than
1 ◦C.
We conclude that the modern trend line of global tem-
perature crossed the early Holocene (smoothed) tempera-
