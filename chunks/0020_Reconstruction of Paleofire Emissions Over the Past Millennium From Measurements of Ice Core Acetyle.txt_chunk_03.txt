acetylene emissions using a chemistry transport model. From 0 to 1500 CE, Antarctic acetylene averages 36 ± 1 pmol mol−1 (mean ± 1 SE), roughly double the annual mean over Antarctica today. Antarctic acetylene declines during the Little Ice Age by over 50% to 17 ± 2 pmol mol−1 from 1650 to 1750 CE. Acetylene over Greenland declines less dramatically over the same period. Modeling results suggest that pyrogenic acetylene emissions during 1000–1500 CE were sustained at rates significantly greater
