patterns before and after the QBO phase transition, especially in the southern hemisphere (SH). The nega-
tive N2O anomaly occurs first in the southern hemisphere (NH) in the ∼2 months leading up to the phase 
change and extends into the SH 0–4 months afterward. This pattern cannot simply be the lagged interhem-
ispheric transport of a NH signal because the SH amplitude is greater than or equal to that in the NH. The
