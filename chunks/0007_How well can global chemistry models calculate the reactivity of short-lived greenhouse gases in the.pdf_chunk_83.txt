than for L-O3 and L-CH4; four models show the upward
curve matching the top-1 % parcels; for L-O3 and L-CH4,
GFDL-NCAR have a ﬂat scatter of points and miss the up-
ward curve because they reset the q of the data stream. Day-
to-day scatter for the top-10 % (deﬁned by the 5-day mean)
is tested with the UCI model in Fig. S6. This one-model syn-
optic cloud variability has similar scatter to that seen for the
more central models (Fig. 7) including the rapid increase in
