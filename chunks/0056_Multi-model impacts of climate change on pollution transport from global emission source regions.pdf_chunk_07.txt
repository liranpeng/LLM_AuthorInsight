Introduction
The transport of pollutants from the atmospheric bound-
ary layer is governed by meteorological processes including
deep convection, Hadley-cell-driven overturning in the trop-
ics, and mid-latitude cyclones, as well as slow low-altitude
airï¬‚ow, small-scale turbulent mixing, and other motions (e.g.
Cooper et al., 2011; TF-HTAP, 2010). Climate change may
