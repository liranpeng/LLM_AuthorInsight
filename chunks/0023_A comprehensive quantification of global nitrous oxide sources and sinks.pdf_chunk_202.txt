current synthesis. aRef. 31 and ref. 62 provide global aquaculture N2O emissions 
in 2013 and in 2009, respectively; and the nutrient budget model30,60,61 provides 
nitrogen flows in global freshwater and marine aquaculture over the period 
1980â€“2016. bModel-based estimates of N2O emissions from inland and coastal 
waters include rivers and reservoirs35,36, lakes51, estuaries35, coastal zones (that 
is, seagrasses, mangroves, saltmarsh and intertidal saltmarsh)68 and coastal 
upwelling50.
