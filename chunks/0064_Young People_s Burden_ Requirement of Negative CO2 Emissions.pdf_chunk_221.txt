ing climate was thus markedly increased by a delay in emis-
sion reductions of 8 years, from 2013 to 2021. Nevertheless,
if rapid emission reductions are initiated soon, it is still pos-
sible that at least a large fraction of required CO2 extrac-
tion can be achieved via relatively natural agricultural and
forestry practices with other beneÔ¨Åts. On the other hand, if
large fossil fuel emissions are allowed to continue, the scale
and cost of industrial CO2 extraction, occurring in conjunc-
