to compute the net climate feedback parameter (λ) to facili-
tate the comparisons with the published sensitivities of vari-
ous E3SM conﬁgurations (Caldwell et al., 2019). The net cli-
mate feedback parameter is deﬁned as the change in the TOA
radiative imbalance caused by 1 K change in the global mean
surface air temperature. The Cess experiment consists of a 5-
year AMIP-type control simulation and a 5-year AMIP-type
test simulation that is identical to the control but with the
