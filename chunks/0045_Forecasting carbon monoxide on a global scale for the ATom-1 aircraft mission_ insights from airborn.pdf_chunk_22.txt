215 hPa level with the recommended quality, status, preci-
sion, and convergence criteria. Although MLS data overlap
with ATom only at the highest ï¬‚ight levels, MLS and MO-
PITT provide complementary views of CO in the upper tro-
posphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) and lower troposphere,
respectively. The MOPITT averaging kernels include some
sensitivity to the 200 hPa level, implying a small overlap be-
tween the MOPITT and MLS observations.
