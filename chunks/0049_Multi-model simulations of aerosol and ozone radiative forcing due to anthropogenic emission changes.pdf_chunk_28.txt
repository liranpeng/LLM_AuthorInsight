(Hoesly et al., 2017) over the period 1990–2015.
face concentrations can be inﬂuenced by interannual varia-
tion (making 20-year trends in surface ozone due to climate
variability as large as caused by changes in emission ozone
precursors) (Barnes et al., 2016), but differences associated
with nudging seem to be small (a few percentage points)
(Sand et al., 2017).
The forcing calculations are quantiﬁed at the top of the
atmosphere for aerosols and at the tropopause for ozone and
