Mean altitude proﬁles
Given the inherent synoptic variability plus the large seasonal
shifts in chemical reactivity across the Paciﬁc and Atlantic
basins seen in the individual proﬁles (Figs. 6–13), one might
ask how useful or representative the four ATom transects are
for testing model statistics. Because the 53◦S–60◦N Paciﬁc
