and ice surfaces, they reduce surface albedo, which ampliﬁes the
positive RF. In addition, deposition of aerosols and their
dissolved nutrients to the biosphere (land and ocean) may
modify biogeochemical processes causing further changes to
climate.74 It is unlikely that these eﬀects add linearly.

consists
mainly of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon (BC)
and organic carbon (OC). These aerosol components interact
