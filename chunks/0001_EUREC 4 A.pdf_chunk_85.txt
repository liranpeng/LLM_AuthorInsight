data with images at 10 m resolution in some visible–near-
infrared bands and 20 m resolution in shortwave-infrared
bands relevant for cloud microphysical retrievals.
The intensity of remote sensing instrumentation in the
vicinity of the EUREC4A-Circle will support efforts to, for
the ﬁrst time, observationally close the column energy bud-
get over the ocean, as well as efforts to test hypotheses that
link precipitation to processes across very different time and
space scales.
