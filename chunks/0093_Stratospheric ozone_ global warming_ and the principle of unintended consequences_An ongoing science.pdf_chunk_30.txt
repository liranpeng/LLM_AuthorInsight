of climate change, including widespread intensification of storms,
and simplifies the phase-out of HCFCs as “protecting the climate.”
Velders et al. (2007) calculated ODSs based on a selection of cases
that exaggerate the influence of ODSs. These scenarios are highly
uncertain, requiring a caveat about the significance of the ODSs as
CFAs. The statement by Velders et al. (2007) that the MP impact of
CFC emission growth would have dominated CO2 climate forcing
