shape-preserving limiters affect the scatter shape in different
ways. It was observed that minimal resolution 1λm is not
necessarily a good proxy for how well a scheme maintains
pre-existing functional relations between tracers. From the
results it is quite clear that the mixing diagnostics measure
a different aspect of accuracy compared to conventional er-
ror norms. In particular, they may be used assess if a shape-
preserving ﬁlter makes the solution more physically realiz-
