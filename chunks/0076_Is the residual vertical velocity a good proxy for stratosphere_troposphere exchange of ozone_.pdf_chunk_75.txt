A stronger Brewer-Dobson circulation indeed means a larger downward O3 ﬂux. However, the increase
does not scale linearly across all time scales because the eddy transport and the irregular buﬀering through
the change in the lowermost stratospheric volume mass are also important factors for determining where
and when STE of O3 takes place. With a stronger BDC in the simulation driven by ECMWF-IFS cycle 29r1
