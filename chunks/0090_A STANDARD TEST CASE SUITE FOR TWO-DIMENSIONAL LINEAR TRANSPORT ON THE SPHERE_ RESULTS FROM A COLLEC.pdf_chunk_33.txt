schemes are based on the form
∂(ρφ)
∂t
+ ∇· (ρφ V ) = 0,
(1)
where ρ is the ﬂuid density, V the ﬂow velocity vector, and
φ the tracer mixing ratio per unit mass. In ﬁnite-volume
schemes the equation of motion is integrated over a control
volume. Similarly, the equation for air density is given by
∂ρ
∂t + ∇· (ρ V ) = 0.
(2)
For Eulerian ﬁnite-volume schemes, Eq. (1) is integrated
in space over a stationary (Eulerian) control grid volume/cell
