troposphere) and much is absorbed in the stratosphere. SJ uses 3 narrow bands to resolve the rapid changes 
in O3 optical depth and attenuation of sunlight as well as a fourth narrow band to 345 nm where transmis-
sion is controlled by Rayleigh scattering. This level of resolution is necessary to calculate photolysis rates. 
The Rayleigh optical depth (mostly tropospheric) drops rapidly from 1.0 at 300 nm to 0.04 at 700 nm. For
