Figure 2. One-dimensional probability distributions for HNO3, NOx, HNO4, PAN, HOOH, and HCHO from the UCI-CTM. The domain
sampled is the tropical Paciﬁc: 20◦S–20◦N, 150–210◦E, 0–12◦km, on 16 August. The units are moles of air per log-scale bin (20 bins per
factor of 10). The area under the curve in the log plot is the air mass of the domain, except for HNO4 and PAN for which there are numerous
