of modern climate models (Flato et al., 2013) remains 3 ◦C
for 2 × CO2.
The possibility of unknown unknowns in models would
keep the uncertainty in the fast-feedback climate sensitivity
high, if it were based on models alone, but as discussed by
Rohling et al. (2012a), paleoclimate data allow narrowing of
the uncertainty. Ice sheet size and the atmospheric amount of
long-lived GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O) under natural conditions
change on multi-millennial timescales. These changes are so
