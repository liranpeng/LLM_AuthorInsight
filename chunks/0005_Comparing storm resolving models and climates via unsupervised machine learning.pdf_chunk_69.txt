could also be extended to alternative data sets, such as the High Resolution Model Inter-comparison Project 
(HighResMIP)49,50Â and observational satellite data sets. Besides variational autoencoders, future studies could 
also focus on other methods such as hierarchical variants, normalizing flows, or diffusion probabilistic models. 
Ultimately, we hope that our work will motivate future data-driven and/or unsupervised investigations in the
