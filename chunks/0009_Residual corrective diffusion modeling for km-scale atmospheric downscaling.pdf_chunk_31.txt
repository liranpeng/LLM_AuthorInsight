Supplementary SectionÂ 7 for additional context. The standard
deviation across our ensemble of 32 generated CorrDiff samples
(second column from the left) is roughly 20% of the magnitude of
the ensemble mean (left column). The CorrDiff prediction for an
arbitrary ensemble member (last sample; 32nd member; third
column from the left) is useful to compare to the target data (right
column). However, due to the stochastic nature of the generation,
