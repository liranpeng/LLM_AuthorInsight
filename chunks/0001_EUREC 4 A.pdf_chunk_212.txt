of EUREC4A’s carbon footprint, which we estimate (see Ap-
pendix A for details) to be 5000 t of CO2. The marginal in-
crease – EUREC4A took place at the expense of other cam-
paigns – is of course much less. The main contribution to
the carbon footprint was from fossil fuels (kerosene and
diesel) used to power the research platforms. The travel of
the participating scientists contributed non-negligibly (5 %)
to EUREC4A’s carbon footprint and provides context for the
total emissions.
