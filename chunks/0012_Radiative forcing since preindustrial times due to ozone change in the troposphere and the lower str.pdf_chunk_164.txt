tions using the UoR-RTM. This radiative transfer model was
previously used in Berntsen et al. (1997), and in Forster and
Shine (1997). UoR-RTM has calculated adjusted radiative
forcing based on the ozone changes calculated by the ULAQ
and CHASER model for the months of January, April, July,
and October. The results are shown in Table 8 along with the
corresponding UiO-RTM results. There is reasonably good
agreement between the two radiative transfer models, espe-
