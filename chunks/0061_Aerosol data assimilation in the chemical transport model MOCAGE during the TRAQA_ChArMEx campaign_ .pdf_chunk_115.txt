tory effects in some layers.
LOAC measurements acquired during the balloon ﬂight
(Fig. 9b) are co-located with the aircraft measurements
(Fig. 8c). They match with the assimilation model run proﬁle
well, which conﬁrms the interpretation already discussed: the
aerosol concentration after an assimilation cycle at a certain
height can only be correct if the proﬁle shape is well simu-
lated in the direct model run.
The third LOAC ﬂight (Fig. 9c) measured moderate
