symphysis disruption from a fall from a 2Â m height (AO: 61C3.1d; Day
Type right: III; left: II). Symphyseal fixation using a 4-hole plate was
chosen for the first treatment and posterior stabilization was planned for
a second, delayed procedure. In the meantime, the symphseal plate
loosened, requiring re-symphyseal plating, the addition of TOCF. In
combination with the posterior fixation, the injury healed regularly but
heterotopic ossification was noted on follow-up radiographs.
