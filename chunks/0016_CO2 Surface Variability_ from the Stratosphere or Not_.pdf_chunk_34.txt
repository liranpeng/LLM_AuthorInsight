small fraction of the observed IAV. In addition, the modeled
eCO2 IAV shows that tropospheric circulation changes pro-
duce small IAV.
I compare CO2 with well-known interannual cycles in the
Earth system in Fig. 1d by plotting (i) the QBO phase change
(from easterly to westerly zonal equatorial wind at 40 hPa,
see Newman, 2021) as thick gray vertical bars and (ii) the
times of moderate to extreme El Niños (red stars) and La
Niñas (blue stars) (Trenberth, 2021). From this analysis, I ex-
