simulations. Similarly, our results indicate a strong effect of
ship emissions on OH and therefore methane lifetime. Thus,
the net effect on radiative forcing from ship emission induced
ozone and methane lifetime changes is strongly negative.
For road and aircraft the ozone perturbations particularly
