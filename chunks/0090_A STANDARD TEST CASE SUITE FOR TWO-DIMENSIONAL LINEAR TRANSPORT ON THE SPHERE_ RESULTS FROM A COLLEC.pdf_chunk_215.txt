setup is manifested by scatter points shifting beyond the up-
per left corner of the convex hull into the overshooting area.
If a scheme is shape-preserving, no scatter points will be
shifted into the overshooting unmixing area. In other words,
the scheme is guaranteed not to expand the range of the ini-
tial condition mixing ratios. Note that non-zero background
values have been chosen for χ so that a positivity-preserving
limiter (positive deﬁnite) will not prevent undershooting.
