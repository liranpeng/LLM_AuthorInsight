to track the Lagrangian evolution of the ﬂow, and simula-
tions with open boundaries matched either to meteorologi-
cal/oceanographic analyses or the free-running global simu-
lations. Few if any ﬁeld studies have beneﬁted from such a
rich complement of modeling activities.
Some of the challenges to evaluating these simulations are
illustrated with the help of preliminary, but idealized, large-
eddy simulations with the forcing speciﬁed based on pre-
