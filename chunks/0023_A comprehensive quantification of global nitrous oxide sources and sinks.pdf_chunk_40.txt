are priorities to reduce uncertainties in bottom-up estimates. Atmos-
pheric observations in underrepresented regions of the world and 
better atmospheric transport models are essential to reduce uncer-
tainty in top-down estimates, whereas more accurate activity data and 
robust emission factors are critical for greenhouse-gas inventories (seeÂ  
Methods for additional discussion on uncertainty).
According to estimates from the Global N2O Model Intercompari-
