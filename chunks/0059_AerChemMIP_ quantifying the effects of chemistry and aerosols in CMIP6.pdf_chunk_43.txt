al., 2009). Methane directly affects the chlorine chemistry
of stratospheric ozone depletion (Pawson et al., 2014). Fur-
thermore, methane is a source of water vapour in the strato-
sphere; this is an important contributor to stratospheric ozone
depletion, especially away from the polar regions. Strato-
spheric water vapour is also a greenhouse gas and changes in
methane thus have a further indirect radiative forcing (Myhre
et al., 2013a). As the methane concentration has more than
