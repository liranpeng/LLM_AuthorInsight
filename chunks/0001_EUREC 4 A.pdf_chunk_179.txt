kilometers in the atmosphere (and ocean for coupled runs)
the simulations explicitly represent scales of motion similar
to those observed, all as part of a consistently represented
global circulation. This enables investigations of processes
inﬂuencing the mesoscale organization of ﬁelds of shallow
convection, including the possible role of surface ocean fea-
tures, as well as a critical evaluation of the simulations.
