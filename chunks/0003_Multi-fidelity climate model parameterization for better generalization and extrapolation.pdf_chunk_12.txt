els can be used in order to build MF approaches including:
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods49,
variational inference techniques50,51, deep ensembles52,53 and
dropout54,55. Given the typical dimensionality and size of the
datasets for Earth System Model (ESM) parameterizations,
the gold-standard MCMC methods are out of scope. Besides,
variational inference approximations can suffer from posterior
variance underestimation and results in a poor approximation
