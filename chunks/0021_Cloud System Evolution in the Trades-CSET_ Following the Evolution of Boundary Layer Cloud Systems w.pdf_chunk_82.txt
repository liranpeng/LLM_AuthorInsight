this low-level leg the aircraft ascends to about 100 m above the cloud base for another 10 
minute leg. During this leg and the 150 m leg, the HCR and the HSRL beams were pointed 
upward. After the in-cloud leg, the aircraft would do an alternating ascent-descent sequence 
with a vertical range of about 500 m (1500 ft) to sample cloud top and the stable layer that 
often caps the cloud. The plan was flexible so that modifications could be made during the
