(except for P-O3 in the Atlantic).
The enhancement factor for the top 50 % L-CH4 parcels is
2.0 (84 % of reactivity in 42 % of mass) given that our 53◦S–
60◦N transects cover 83 % of the air mass below 200 hPa and
assuming that L-CH4 is negligible poleward of these tran-
sects. This enhancement factor is a large-scale feature be-
cause the tropical lower troposphere, being warm and wet
with high sun, dominates the budget. It is seen in previous
