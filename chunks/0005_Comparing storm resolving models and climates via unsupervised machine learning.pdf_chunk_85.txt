The top panels (g,j) show clear differences in their latent organization compared to the remaining models; see 
“Dynamic consistency between high-resolution climate models” for a discussion. Movies S2–S6 show additional 
animations of the latent space.

obtained from UM test data reveals three distinct regimes of convection. Panel (a) shows each cluster’s median 
vertical structure, calculated by
