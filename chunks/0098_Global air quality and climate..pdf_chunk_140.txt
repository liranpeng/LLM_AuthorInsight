allows for new insights into the processes contributing to
regional climate responses to aerosol forcings. Ongoing com-
munity eﬀorts to evaluate rigorously the current generation
of chemistry–climate and chemical transport models with
process-level observational and laboratory constraints should
help bridge knowledge gaps. We focus below on a few areas
where current research eﬀorts are expected to advance knowl-
edge rapidly.
