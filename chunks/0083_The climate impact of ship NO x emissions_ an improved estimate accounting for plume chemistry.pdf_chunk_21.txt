form 5 % increase in ship NOx emissions and another with
zero ship NOx emissions. Results are derived from a simula-
tion of year 2006 after spin-up from July 2005.

Plume chemistry and dispersion
Previous versions of GEOS-Chem assumed that sub-grid
chemistry in ship plumes convert each mole of NOx emis-
sions into 10 mole of O3 and 1 moles of HNO3 – an ozone
