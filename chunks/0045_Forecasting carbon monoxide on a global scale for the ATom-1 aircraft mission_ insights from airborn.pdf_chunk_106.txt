the Southern Hemisphere. Plumes of elevated CO from both
biomass burning and non-BB sources led to observations of
enhanced CO during ATom-1.
We use satellite observations of CO from MOPITT and
MLS and AOT from MODIS to assess whether August 2016,
the period sampled by ATom-1, is typical or atypical in the
context of IAV in the satellite record (2000â€“2016). MOPITT
and MLS show that CO in the lower and upper troposphere,
respectively, were below average in August 2016 compared
