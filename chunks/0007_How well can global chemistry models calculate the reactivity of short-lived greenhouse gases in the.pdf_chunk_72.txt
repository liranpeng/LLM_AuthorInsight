tics. The Venn overlap diagrams will become more interest-
ing with an observational data stream as they point to the
co-occurrence of unusual atmospheric parcels.
At what level do the models agree on the hot, top-10 %
parcels? We use the reference case deﬁned above and sort
each reactivity to identify the top-10 %, retain those parcel
numbers and compare across models. Table S6 gives each
model’s overlap of their top-X % parcels in terms of the per-
