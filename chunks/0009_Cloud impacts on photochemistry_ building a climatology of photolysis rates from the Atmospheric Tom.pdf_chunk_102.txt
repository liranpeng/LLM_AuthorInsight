and non-random J values, most modeling solves the radia-
tive transfer problem for a 1-D plane-parallel atmosphere that
is horizontally homogeneous. Most chemistry models adopt
a simple averaging procedure to create a single, horizontally
homogeneous cloudy atmosphere in each grid cell and then
solving for a single J value (see Table 1). The UCI model
uses decorrelation lengths to determine cloud overlap, to gen-
erate a set of independent column atmospheres (ICAs), to
