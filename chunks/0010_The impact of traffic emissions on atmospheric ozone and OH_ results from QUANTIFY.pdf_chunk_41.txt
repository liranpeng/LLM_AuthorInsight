It clearly shows that depending on the region where the emis-
sions occur the effects are very different and can even have
opposite signs.
The non-linearity with respect to aircraft emissions is
mostly positive throughout the northern upper troposphere
(i.e. the scaled small NOx reduction leads to a stronger
