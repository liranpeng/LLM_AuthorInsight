shift into the convex hull, the mixing is categorized as “real”
mixing.
Associated with each area are mixing diagnostics that
quantify the mixing in terms of normalized distances from
the pre-existing functional curve (Fig. B1 in LSPT2012): ℓr
for “real mixing”, ℓu for range-preserving unmixing, and ℓo
for overshooting (for deﬁnitions of ℓi, i = “r”, “u”, and “o”,
see Lauritzen and Thuburn, 2012). Following LSPT2012 the
ℓi is computed half way through the simulation, t = T/2,
