lations rather than direct measures. Hydrogen leakages will lead
to global warming, and it will be important to keep these leakages
at a minimum to accomplish the beneÔ¨Åts of switching to a
hydrogen economy. Therefore, it will be important to develop
instruments for leakage detection for monitoring, so we can get a
better picture of how large these leakages are today.
