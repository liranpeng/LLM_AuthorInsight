Ozone
Projected changes in surface O3 for the near-term (2030 and
2050) due to changes solely in climate or solely in emissions of O3
precursors show some general patterns across the globe (Fig. 3).
The largest surface O3 changes under the recently developed
RCP (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) emission pathways are much smaller
