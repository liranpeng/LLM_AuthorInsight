forecasts and analyses.
We take ATom-1 CO observations from the Harvard
quantum cascade laser spectrometer (QCLS) instrument
(Santoni et al., 2014), which has a history of successful
measurements during the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observa-
tions (HIPPO) campaign. Brieﬂy, the instrument uses a
pulsed quantum cascade laser at 2160 cm−1 to measure
absorption of CO through an astigmatic multi-pass sam-
