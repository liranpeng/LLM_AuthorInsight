Emissions
Emissions used in this work are representative of 1997â€“2010,
but do not resolve trends or interannual variability in anthro-
pogenic or biogenic emissions. To the extent possible, we
use identical emissions across all models. Anthropogenic,
biogenic, and biomass burning emissions of NOx, CO, and
isoprene are fully consistent in all models. Some differences
in VOC emissions arise because of the different lumping
schemes used in the various chemical mechanisms and be-
