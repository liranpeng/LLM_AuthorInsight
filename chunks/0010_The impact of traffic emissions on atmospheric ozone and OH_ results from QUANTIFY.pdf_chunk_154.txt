in the upper troposphere as shown in Figs. 6–7, lead to a to-
tal positive forcing, compensating the methane forcing. This
also indicates the importance of convection for the vertical
transport of road emissions and ozone precursors, which is
more efﬁcient over land compared to convection over the
ocean, where ship emissions occur.
