(0.7–2.4 µm) to 0.10 µm (2.5 µm–4.0 µm). Four thin colored lines plotted on top of the ice cloud data are taken from 
Ping Yang's library (Bi & Yang, 2017) of ice crystal optics for droxtals, 8-columns, 10-plates, and small bullet rosettes, all 
with roughness value of 003). The Reff values of 48 µm correspond to maximum diameters of 112, 312, 738, and 238 µm, 
respectively. The Zhao et al. (2018) new derivation of ice-cloud single scattering albedo for the RRTMG bands is shown
