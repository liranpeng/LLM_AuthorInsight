and prior estimates of MCF emissions. When integrating atmo-
spheric chemistry over this period with 3D models that spatially
and chemically resolve the atmosphere and incorporate our best
knowledge of weather, climate, and human activity (e.g., refs. 13,
23, 26, and 27), these models predict much less decadal-scale OH
variability and no clear peak in the mid-2000s. So we might con-
clude that an important process, some chemistryâ€“climate feedback,
is missing from the 3D models.
