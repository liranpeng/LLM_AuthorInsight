quality over the next century relative to those using the IPCC SRES scenarios. These two sets of
projections likely bracket possible futures. We ﬁnd that uncertainty in emission-driven changes in
air quality is generally greater than uncertainty in climate-driven changes. Conﬁdence in air
quality projections is limited by the reliability of anthropogenic emission trajectories and the
uncertainties in regional climate responses, feedbacks with the terrestrial biosphere, and oxidation
