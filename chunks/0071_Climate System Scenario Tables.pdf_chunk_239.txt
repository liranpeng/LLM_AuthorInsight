models contributing historical experiments (1986–2005H), and the subsets of models contributing to each RCP experiment (next line, 1986–2005). For SRES A1B the same set of models is used from 
1850 to 2100. Values are 10-year averages (2090d = 2086–2095) and show multi-model means and standard deviations. See Chapter 12, Section 12.3 and discussion of Figure 12.4, also Sections
