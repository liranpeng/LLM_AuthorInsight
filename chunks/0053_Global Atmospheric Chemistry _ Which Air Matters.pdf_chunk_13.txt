atmospheric heterogeneity of species composition. For ex-
ample, Fig. 1a presents a single-day snapshot of the column
loss of methane as simulated by the UC Irvine chemistry-
transport model (CTM) at a resolution of 1◦in latitude and
longitude. Even column averages over 24 h show a ﬁlamen-
tary structure with most of the tropospheric loss of methane
occurring in sharp synoptic patterns. These chemical patterns
have similarities with the atmospheric rivers of column wa-
