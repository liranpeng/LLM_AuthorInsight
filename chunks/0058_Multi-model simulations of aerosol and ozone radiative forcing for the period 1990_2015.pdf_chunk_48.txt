+0.07 W m−2 (see Fig. 4b), with values about 20 % lower
than in IPCC AR5. Between 2010 and 2015 the multi-model
mean drops by 25 %. The model spread for BC is generally
somewhat larger than for sulfate, where differences in the
modelled BC vertical proﬁle are the main contributors (Hod-
nebrog et al., 2014; Samset et al., 2013). The BC emission
increases from 1990 to 2015 are 10 % in the global sum, but
the increase in radiative forcing is relatively larger, and thus
