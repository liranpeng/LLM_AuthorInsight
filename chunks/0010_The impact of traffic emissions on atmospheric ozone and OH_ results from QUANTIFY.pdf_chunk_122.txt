OH has the highest potential to be recycled via the reaction
of NO with HO2, which is produced after the initial reaction
of OH on the carbon containing reactive species (e.g. CO,
CH4, NMHCs). The additional NO2 from this reaction in
turn leads to the enhanced formation of ozone and OH pro-
duction via O1(D). During winter the emissions of CO and
