cerning the separated effect of climate change on modeled
ozone change, the results from the CCMs including detailed
tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry schemes are rather
consistent. These results are in contrast to those from an
earlier study (Johnson et al., 1999), which predicted a 10%
decrease in the tropospheric ozone burden due to climate
change in a doubled-CO2 atmosphere. In that study, temper-
atures close to the surface increased by 3.28 K (or about 2â€“5
