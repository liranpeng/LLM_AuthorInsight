prospects for stabilizing climate. How consistent with reality
are scenarios for phasing down climate forcing when tested
by observational data? What changes to industrial and agri-
cultural emissions are required to stabilize climate? We ad-
dress these issues below.

GHG climate forcing growth rates and emission
scenarios
Insight is obtained by comparing the growth rate of GHG cli-
mate forcing based on observed GHG amounts with past and
