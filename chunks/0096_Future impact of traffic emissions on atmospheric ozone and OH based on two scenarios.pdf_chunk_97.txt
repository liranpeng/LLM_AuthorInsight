worth noting the net RF due to changes in O3 and CH4 from
all three transport sectors combined, which is slightly nega-
tive in 2000 (−0.44 ± 13 mW m−2), and strongly negative in
2050 (−32 ± 18 mW m−2 for A1B and −32 ± 9.3 mW m−2
for B1), partly due to the reduced impact of ROAD. In order
to assess the total climate impact from the transport sectors,
RF due to changes in e.g. CO2, SO2 and BC must be included
and will yield very different net forcings (see e.g. Olivi´e et
al., 2012).
