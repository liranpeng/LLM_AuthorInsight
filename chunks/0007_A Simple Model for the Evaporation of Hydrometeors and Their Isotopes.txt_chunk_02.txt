Cloud condensation and hydrometeor evaporation fractionate stable isotopes of water, enriching liquid with heavy isotopes; whereupon updrafts, downdrafts, and rain vertically redistribute water and its isotopes in the lower troposphere. These vertical water fluxes through the marine boundary layer affect low cloud climate feedback and, combined with isotope fractionation, are hypothesized to explain the depletion of tropical precipitation at higher precipitation rates known as the â€œamount
