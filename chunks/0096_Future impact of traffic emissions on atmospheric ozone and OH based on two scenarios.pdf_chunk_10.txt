latter group of emissions, which is also important for air
quality and the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, and
consists of the relatively short-lived gases nitrogen oxides
(NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and non-methane hydrocar-
bons (NMHCs). On a 100-yr time scale, tropospheric O3
constitutes the second largest positive radiative forcing (RF)
term (after CO2) due to present-day (year 2000) trafÔ¨Åc emis-
