range covers soil uptake, photochemical production of hydrogen, the lifetimes of hydrogen
and methane, and the hydroxyl radical feedback on methane and hydrogen. The hydrogen-
induced changes are robust across the different models. It will be important to keep hydrogen
leakages at a minimum to accomplish the beneÔ¨Åts of switching to a hydrogen economy.
