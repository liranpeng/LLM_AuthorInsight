in the acetylene and ethane dry matter burned histories is from scenarios in which ethane has a large chlor-
ine sink, consistent with recent modeling work by Wang et al. (2019). This suggests that chlorine plays an
important role in the global ethane budget and should be included in future analyses. The history of atmo-
spheric hydrocarbons in polar ice clearly contains a wealth of useful information about the history of burn-
