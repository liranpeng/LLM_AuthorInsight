Thus, preindustrial global temperature has uncertainty of at
least 0.1 ◦C, and the 1880–1920 period, which has the merit
of near-global data, yields our best estimate of preindustrial
temperature.

Land vs. ocean warming at equilibrium
Observations (Fig. A3a) show surface air temperature (SAT)
over land increasing almost twice as much as sea surface
temperature (SST) during the past century. This large differ-
ence is likely partly due to the thermal inertia of the ocean,
