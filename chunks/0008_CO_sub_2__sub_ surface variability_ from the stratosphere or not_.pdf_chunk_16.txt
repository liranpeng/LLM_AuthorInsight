studies of Ruiz et al. (2021) with parallel model simulations
of CO2 to place constraints on the CO2 IAV caused by atmo-
spheric circulation, Ô¨Ånding that this effect is a clear but minor
perturbation in driving the observed IAV of CO2.

Methods and analysis
I investigate the CO2 IAV and its causes using surface CO2
observations from 1985 through 2020, surface N2O observa-
tions from 1997 through 2020, and tracer simulations from
the UC Irvine chemistry-transport model (CTM) simulations
