(29 July 2016) occurred during the North American Mon-
soon when there was easterly ﬂow off Mexico; thus the high
reactivity of this large air mass indicates that continental deep
convection is a source of high reactivity for both O3 and CH4.
In the Atlantic (row 3), we also see similar air masses
through successive proﬁles, particularly in the northern trop-
ics. The Atlantic P-O3 shows high-altitude reactivity simi-
lar to the eastern Paciﬁc. Likewise, the large values of L-O3
