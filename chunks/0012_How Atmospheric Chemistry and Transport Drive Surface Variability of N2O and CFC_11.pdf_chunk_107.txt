MLS N2O loss is well matched in both GMI and UCI simulations, and further, the F11X losses parallel those 
of N2O. The sustained westerlies during 2016/18 produce a broad peak of N2O loss that is well matched by 
GMI and UCI. The UCI simulation ended during this anomaly but appears to capture the first half of the 
peak loss. GMI was able to capture this anomaly in its entirety, but unfortunately, the LMDz5 simulation 
ended before the anomaly began.
