1. Introduction
High concentrations of tropospheric ozone (O3) near the Earthâ€™s
surface has a range of detrimental effects including increased
mortality (Bell et al., 2004), decreased crop production (Hollaway
et al., 2012) and impaired visibility (Sillman, 2003). Recently, it
has been shown that nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) from road
transport have been an important contributor towards tropo-
spheric O3 mixing ratios in the lower troposphere at the beginning
