from the ATom measurements. The key model-dependent
quantities that control the reactivities are the photolysis rates,
which depend on clouds and the overhead column ozone.
Figure 4 compares the J values and reactivities for the
ATom-1 parcels calculated for day numbers 213 (1 August)
and 223 (11 August). The J values have the largest scatter,
and this drives a reduced level of scatter in reactivities. The
J-NO2 value is not much affected by the overhead ozone col-
