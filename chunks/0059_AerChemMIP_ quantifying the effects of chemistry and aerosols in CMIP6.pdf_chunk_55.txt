bound. While this uncertainty will clearly be region, sector
and species dependent, it would be beyond the scope of this
project to explore the full spectrum of variations. Results
from the simulations can be directly compared to the sim-
ulations in Sect. 3.1 and analysed for differences in radiative
forcing as well as air quality and overall atmospheric com-
position. Inter-model differences will document their varying
sensitivities to emissions.
