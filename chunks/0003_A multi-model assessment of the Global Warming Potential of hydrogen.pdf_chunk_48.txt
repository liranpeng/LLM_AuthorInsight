conﬁdence interval) in addition to the 90% conﬁdence interval assuming a symmetric soil sink uncertainty. We also present the full absolute uncertainty and the source we used to estimate the
uncertainty. Where the model ensemble is listed, we have used the standard deviation of the variable from our model ensemble, otherwise, the literature source for the uncertainty estimate is listed.
Similar tables for GWP20 and GWP500 can be found in Supplementary Tables 9 and 10.
