ical SSTs with full seasonality. In the simulations labeled
+4K and +8K, the standard SST is elevated by 4K and 8K
respectively.
The high-fidelity SPCAM5 training data is constructed by
considering a historical run simulation while allowing for a
model spin-up of a month. The training data corresponds to
the time period from February 1st 2003 to April 31st 2003.
The horizontal grid resolution of the ESM consists of a 1.9◦×
2.5◦finite-volume dynamical core (i.e., 13824 grid cells with
