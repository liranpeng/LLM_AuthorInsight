tions, especially in areas where exceedances are likely to oc-
cur. Fiore et al. (2003) accounts for the clustering of urban
stations by ﬁrst averaging the station observations on a ﬁner
grid (0.5◦× 0.5◦) and then averages those cells to match the
coarser model grid. In any case, Diem (2003) notes that al-
most all ozone-mapping methods have major problems and
that this is neither a simple nor a solved task. The task here
is very different from that of interpolating spatial extremes
