the SH high latitudes (Fig. A2a) along with temperature in-
creases (Fig. A2b) and polar vortex weakening (Fig. A2c).
It appears that the heating changes near the tropopause lead
to changes in its stability, as shown by the squared buoy-
ancy frequency (N2) (Fig. A2e), altering the wave propaga-
tions as a valve: the enhanced vertical gradient of N2 sup-
presses wave propagation from the troposphere to the strato-
sphere over SH high latitudes (Chen and Robinson, 1992;
