Global chemistry models cannot be used productively in
comparisons with individual CAFS observations as noted
above, but a statistical comparison of the ratio J-cloudy
to J-clear is a useful climatological test. It is difﬁcult for
the models to simulate CAFS global data unless there is a
very careful sampling strategy to match albedos from the
ATom ﬂights over land and cryosphere. Thus, we focus on
