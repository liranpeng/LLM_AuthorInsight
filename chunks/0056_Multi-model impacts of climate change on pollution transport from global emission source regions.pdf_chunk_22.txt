tracer gradient, which was attributed to a slightly higher
tropopause. More recently, Orbe et al. (2015) used idealised
tracers of air-mass origin, as described in Orbe et al. (2013b),
to track how future increases in greenhouse gases modiﬁed
transport patterns extending from the northern mid-latitude
boundary layer into the Arctic. Using idealised tracers they
