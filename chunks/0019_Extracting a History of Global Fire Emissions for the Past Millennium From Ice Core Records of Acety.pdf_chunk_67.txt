(Burkholder et al., 2015). The ratio of kethane/kmethane is roughly 569.
Assuming the upper limit chlorine sink of 5% of total methane loss, the resulting methane lifetime due to
chlorine loss is about 200 years (Prather et al., 2012). Using this lifetime, and the kethane/kmethane ratio, we
calculated the impact on the ethane sink as follows:
1
τtotal
¼
1
τOH
þ 1
τCl
(6)
where τOH is the lifetime of ethane due to OH oxidation (which we assumed is 2.5 months or roughly
