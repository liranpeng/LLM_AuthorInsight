sorption only, for the stratosphere; Fast-JX applied full scat-
tering to all 18 bands. Fast-J is used here throughout, al-
though some recent code versions use the JX notation.
Clouds can increase photolysis rates through scattered
sunlight, but they can greatly reduce them by shadowing.
Modeling the scattering by cloud layers in a column atmo-
sphere and resulting photolysis rates is practical, as in Fast-J,
if the layers are horizontally uniform across the modeled air
