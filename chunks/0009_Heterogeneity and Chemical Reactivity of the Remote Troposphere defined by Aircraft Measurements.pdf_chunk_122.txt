This paper opens a door for what the community can do with
the ATom measurements and the derived products. ATom’s
mix of key species allows us to calculate the reactivity of
the air parcels and hopefully may become standard for tro-
pospheric chemistry campaigns. We ﬁnd that the reactivity
of the troposphere with respect to O3 and CH4 is dominated
by a fraction of the air parcels but not by so small and infre-
