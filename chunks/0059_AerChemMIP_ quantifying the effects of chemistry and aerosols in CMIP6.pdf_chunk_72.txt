studying the climate and air quality impacts of future emis-
sion reduction will need to perform a three-member ensem-
ble of SSP3-7.0 as described in ScenarioMIP (Oâ€™Neill et al.,
2016) (41 years for each member).
3.1
Historical (in support of science question 2.1)
These experiments are designed to quantify the contribu-
tions of aerosols (tropospheric) and ozone (tropospheric and
stratospheric) to climate change over the historical period.
