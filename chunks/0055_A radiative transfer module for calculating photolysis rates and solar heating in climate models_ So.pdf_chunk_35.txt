Cloud-J v7.4 has pre-computed tables of optical proper-
ties for typical aerosols and for both liquid- and ice-water
clouds. For bins S1–S18, many of these are effectively non-
absorbing. With the extension to longer wavelengths, it be-
comes important to treat the absorption by clouds and the
stratospheric sulfate layer. We take the refractive indices for
liquid water, ice water, and sulfuric acid and calculate solar-
ﬂux-weighted mean values for each bin (S12–S27). Sunlight
