By considering the sedimentation process adjacent to default one‐moment microphysics in HR, condensed phase particles can be removed from the entrainment zone, which further reduces entrainment efficiency. The result is an HR that can produce more low clouds with a higher liquid water path and a reduced stratocumulus dim bias. Associated improvements in the explicitly simulated sub‐cloud eddy spectrum are observed. We report these sensitivities in multi‐week tests and then explore their
