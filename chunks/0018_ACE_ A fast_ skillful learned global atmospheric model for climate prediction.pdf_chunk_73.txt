Random seed ensemble
Figure 6 shows the time-mean RMSE across a 5-member random seed ensemble of models. Although
all models are capable of stable 10-year inference runs, the magnitude of the time-mean RMSE metric
can vary by up to a factor 4 (depending on output variable being considered). The results in the main
