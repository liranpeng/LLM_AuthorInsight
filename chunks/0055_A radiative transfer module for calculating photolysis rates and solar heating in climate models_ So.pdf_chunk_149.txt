rus clouds, typical stratus clouds, and very thick frontal or
cumulus clouds. While each grid cell may have up to four
QCAs, on average there are only 2.75. Solar-J then calcu-
lates all wavelength bins using all QCAs to compute the
average. Cloud-J (Prather 2015) compared several approxi-
mations for calculating average photolysis rates (Js) within
