pacts was vividly illustrated by EUREC4Aâ€™s extensive use
of robotic sensors (uncrewed aerial systems, UASs; au-
tonomous ocean-observing platforms, AOOPs). In many
cases these provided more agile and less energy intensive
ways of sampling the environment. For instance, the Sail-
drones, Wave Gliders, and AutoNaut (Caravela) make use of
renewable energy sources for their propulsion (e.g., wind for
Saildrones, waves for the Wave Gliders and AutoNaut), and
