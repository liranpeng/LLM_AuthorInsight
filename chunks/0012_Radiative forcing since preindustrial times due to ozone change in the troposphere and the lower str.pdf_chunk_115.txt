ary layer ventilation, deposition velocities, etc. These pro-
cesses inï¬‚uence atmospheric chemistry and thus ozone and
other chemically active greenhouse gases.
From radiative transfer considerations, increases in well-
mixed greenhouse gases and ozone are assumed to lead
to tropospheric warming, while in the stratosphere, in-
creases in well-mixed greenhouse gases and the reduc-
tion of ozone both have a cooling effect, as the in-
crease in greenhouse gases leads to increased emissivity
