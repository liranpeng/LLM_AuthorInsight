an important test and can be used to identify bias in either
hindcasts or climate simulations, it is the distribution of ex-
tremes, both high and low, that we want our climate models
to simulate accurately. The lows tell us about baseline (clean-
air) O3, and the highs show the efﬁciency of O3 production
from the local emissions. Here we examine the distribution
of MDA8, combining the daily gridded US and EU values
for a season over the 2 years 2005–2006 from both obser-
