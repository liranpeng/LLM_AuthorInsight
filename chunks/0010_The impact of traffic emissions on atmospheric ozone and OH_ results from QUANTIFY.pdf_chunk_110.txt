Since ships largely emit over the open oceans where con-
vection is not as strong as over the continents, they have a
much lower potential to reach the upper troposphere of the
extratropics compared to road emissions. Therefore, in the
winter hemispheres the effects of road and ship trafﬁc on
ozone show similar patterns (Fig. 6). As indicated by Fig. 8
the relative contribution of road trafﬁc on the free and up-
