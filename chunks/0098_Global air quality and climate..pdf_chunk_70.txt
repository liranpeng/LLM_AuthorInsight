of NTCFs can depend on emission location and chemical
interactions with co-emitted species, which can vary strongly
by emission sector. Determining the net climate impact of the
suite of emissions from an anthropogenic activity requires
explicit three-dimensional model calculations that consider
interactions
and
nonlinearities
between
the
co-emitted
chemical species, which may have oﬀsetting or additive climate
impacts. Global chemistry–climate models are often employed
