The power spectra and distributions are compared for an
interpolated ERA5 input, CorrDiff, RF, UNet, and target (WRF).
These results reflect reductions over space, time and for CorrDiff
across 32 different samples per each time. Left: power spectra for
kinetic energy (a), 2-m temperature (b) and radar reflectivity (c).
Right: distributions of 10-m windspeed, (d), 2-m temperature (e)
and radar reflectivity (f). Radar reflectivity is not included in the
