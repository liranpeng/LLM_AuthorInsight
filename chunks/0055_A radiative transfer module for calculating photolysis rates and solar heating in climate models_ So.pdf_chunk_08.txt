conﬁdence in the aerosol–climate feedback, through both
aerosol and cloud albedo, is even lower, and the uncer-
tainty is ±0.2 W m−2 ◦C−1. Major modeling challenges nat-
urally point to the sub-grid parameterizations of clouds and
cloud–aerosol interactions in coarsely gridded global mod-
els, and the IPCC reports have documented substantial devel-
opments in the modeling of the chemical–physical properties
