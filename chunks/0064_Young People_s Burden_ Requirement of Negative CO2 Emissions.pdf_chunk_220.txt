achieve 350 ppm CO2 in 2100 was ∼100 PgC if 6 % yr−1
emission reductions began in 2013 (Hansen et al., 2013a).
Required extraction is at least ∼150 PgC in our updated sce-
narios, which incorporate growth of emissions in the past 4
years and assume that emissions will continue at approx-
imately current levels until a global program of emission
reductions begins in 4 years (in 2021 relative to 2020; see
Figs. 9 and 10 for reduction rates). The difﬁculty of stabiliz-
