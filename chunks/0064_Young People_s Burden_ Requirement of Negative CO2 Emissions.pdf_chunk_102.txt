oscillations of annual growth are correlated with global tem-
perature and with the El Niño/La Niña cycle, as discussed in
Appendix A8. Recent global temperature anomalies peaked
in February 2016, so as expected the CO2 growth rate has
been declining for the past several months (Fig. 6a).

with the atmospheric oxidation sink, but growth resumed in
