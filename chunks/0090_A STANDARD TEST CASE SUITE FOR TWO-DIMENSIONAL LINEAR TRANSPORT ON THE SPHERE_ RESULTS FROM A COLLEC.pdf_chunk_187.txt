sually. It is immediately apparent, most notably in the areas
away from the slotted cylinders where the ﬁeld should be
constant, whether a scheme is not strictly shape-preserving
(light blue contour ﬁlling). Almost all unlimited schemes
show “ripples” in this area. Similarly, overshoots over the
slotted cylinders are immediately visible (dark red contour
ﬁlling). The wavelength of the spurious oscillations is related
to the formal order of the schemes. For example, the oscilla-
