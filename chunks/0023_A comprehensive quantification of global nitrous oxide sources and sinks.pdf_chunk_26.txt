faster increase than in the three inventories used in our study (see Meth-
ods; Extended Data Fig. 4a); this is largely attributed to the interac-
tive effects between climate change and nitrogen additions, as well as 
spatio-temporal variability in environmental factors such as rainfall 
and temperature, that modulate the N2O yield from nitrification and 
denitrification. This result is in line with the increased emission factor
