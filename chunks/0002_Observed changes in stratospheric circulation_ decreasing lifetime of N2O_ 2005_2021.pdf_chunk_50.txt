(Table S7). Assuming that the pre-industrial stratospheric
loss (10.5 TgN yr−1) is natural and has remained constant,
then the anthropogenic emission for the 2000s decade is
6.0 TgN yr−1 and that for the 2010s decade is 7.6 TgN yr−1.
This 27 %/decade increase in anthropogenic emissions
comes primarily from the increasing N2O atmospheric bur-
den, with 4 %/decade of the total coming from the decrease in
N2O lifetime derived here. Such growth in emissions shows
