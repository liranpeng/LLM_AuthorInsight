we see that the central Paciﬁc single transects (165, 180, 195,
210◦E) with overlapping ellipses match the full block of data
(150–210◦E). In terms of overlapping area, the single tran-
sects overlap the full block at the 86–94 % level, whereas the
150◦E transect is distinctly different with overlap of only 42
