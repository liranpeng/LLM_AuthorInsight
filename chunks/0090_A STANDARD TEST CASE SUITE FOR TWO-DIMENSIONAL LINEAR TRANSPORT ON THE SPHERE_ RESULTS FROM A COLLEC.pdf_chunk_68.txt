ing a stream function evaluated at mesh cell corners. Con-
sequently, a constant density ﬁeld in a non-divergent ﬂow
is preserved in the discretized CLAW scheme based on the
advective form. Clawpack is not strictly a transport code,
but is designed to solve more general non-linear hyperbolic
problems. The problems presented here are ideally suited
for AMRClaw, the spatially adaptive version of Clawpack
(http://www.clawpack.org).
