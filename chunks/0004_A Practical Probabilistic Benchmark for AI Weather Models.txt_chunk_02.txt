Since the weather is chaotic, it is necessary to forecast an ensemble of future states. Recently, multiple AI weather models have emerged claiming breakthroughs in deterministic skill. Unfortunately, it is hard to fairly compare ensembles of AI forecasts because variations in ensembling methodology become confounding and the baseline data volume is immense. We address this by scoring lagged initial condition ensembles—whereby an ensemble can be constructed from a library of deterministic
