ture anomalies. Although human-caused increases of GHGs
would be expected to have caused a small warming by then,
that warming was at least partially balanced by cooling from
larger than average volcanic activity in 1880–1920. Extreme
Little Ice Age conditions may have been ∼0.1 ◦C cooler than
the 1880–1920 mean (Abram et al., 2016), but the Little Ice
Age is inappropriate to deﬁne preindustrial because the deep
ocean temperature did not have time to reach equilibrium.
