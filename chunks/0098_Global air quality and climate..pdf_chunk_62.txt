precipitation.80,108,116–121 Absorbing aerosols are possibly
more potent at altering circulation patterns than CO2 and
scattering aerosols.122–125 Observed drying trends over Africa,
South Asia and northern China over the past decades have
been partially attributed to anthropogenic aerosol forcing
(e.g., ref, 80, 117, 126 and 127), suggesting that aerosol
decreases in these regions over the next century would reverse
