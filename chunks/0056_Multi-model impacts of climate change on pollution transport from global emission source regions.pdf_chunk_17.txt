et al., 2015; Shaw et al., 2016) and to the rise in tropopause
height (Lorenz and De Weaver, 2007). However, the zonally
asymmetric and seasonally varying response of mid-latitude
storm tracks to forced climate change is much less robust
(Simpson et al., 2014; Shaw et al., 2016), partly due to inter-
annual variability (Deser et al., 2012; Shepherd, 2014).
In terms of ozone pollution transport, this shift in the mid-
latitude storm track position has been related to reduced mid-
