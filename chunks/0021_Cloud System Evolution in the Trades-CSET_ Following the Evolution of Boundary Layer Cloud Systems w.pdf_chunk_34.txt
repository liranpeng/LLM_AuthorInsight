stratocumulus clouds as they transition into the fair-weather cumulus regimes 
within the subtropical easterlies over the northern Pacific.
•
Examine the cloud microphysical properties and processes as a function of 
boundary-layer depth, towards assessing the relative contributions of internal and 
external processes to boundary-layer cloud-system evolution.
•
Evaluate the relative importance of boundary layer deepening and precipitation
