ozone data set v1.0 (Hegglin et al., 2016) in the troposphere
but uses the prognostic linearized ozone chemistry scheme
(Linoz v2) (Hsu and Prather, 2009) in the stratosphere. Linoz
calculates the stratospheric ozone net tendency with its ﬁrst-
order Taylor series expansion as a function of local ozone
mixing ratio, local temperature, and overhead ozone column.
The linearized production and loss coefﬁcients are updated
for E3SMv1 using the greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations
