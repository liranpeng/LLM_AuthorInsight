lifetime, suggesting that modelled OH abundances (which
control the methane lifetime) do not control the NOy life-
times. Another factor could be the efficiency of uptake of
NOy by aerosols; an efficient uptake will reduce the NOy
lifetime and hence the amounts available for long range
transport.

Conclusions
[17] Fifteen global chemistry-transport models have been
used to assess the transport and deposition of NOy between
four regions representing the major source areas. A source-
