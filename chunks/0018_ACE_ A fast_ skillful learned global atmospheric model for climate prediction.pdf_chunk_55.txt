ranges from 0 to 7 starting at the top of atmosphere and increasing towards the surface. The Time
column indicates whether a variable represents the value at a particular time step (“Snapshot”),
the average across the 6-hour time step (“Mean”) or a quantity which does not depend on time
(“Invariant”). “TOA” denotes “Top Of Atmosphere”, the climate model’s upper boundary.
