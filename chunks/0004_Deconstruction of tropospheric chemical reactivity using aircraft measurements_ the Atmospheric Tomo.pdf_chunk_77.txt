inﬂuenced by continental outﬂow from North and Central
America, we separate them from the central Paciﬁc in our
examination of the tropical oceans (see Fig. 2). Curtain plots
of the four reactivities for ATom-1234 in the central Paciﬁc
are shown in Figs. 14–17, in the eastern Paciﬁc in Figs. 18–
21, and in the tropical Atlantic in Figs. 22–25. In terms
of P-O3, the central Paciﬁc shows a few hotspots but gen-
erally no large regions > 3 ppb d−1. The tropical Atlantic
