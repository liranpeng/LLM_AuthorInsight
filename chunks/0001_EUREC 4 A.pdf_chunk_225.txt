sequent analysis of the EUREC4A data will teach us a great
deal more about the ways of clouds, how they couple to cir-
culation systems on different scales, how they inﬂuence and
are inﬂuenced by the upper ocean, the extent to which they
are susceptible to perturbations in the aerosol environment,
and how precipitation links processes across scales. At the
very least a better quantiﬁcation of these sensitivities should
help us understand to what extent a warmer world will ex-
