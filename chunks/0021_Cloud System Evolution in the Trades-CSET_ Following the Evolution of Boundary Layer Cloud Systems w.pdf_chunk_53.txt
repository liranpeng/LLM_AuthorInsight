used to characterize the vertical velocity structure of stratocumulus clouds (e.g. Lothon et al. 
2004; Ghate et al. 2010) and of shallow cumulus clouds (e,g, Geerts and Miao, 2005; Ghate 
et al., 2011; Wang and Geerts, 2012). During non-precipitating conditions (reflectivity < âˆ’15 
dBZ) when the cloud droplets have negligible fall velocity, the measured Doppler velocity 
corrected for the aircraft motion can be used as a proxy for the vertical air motion (Lothon et
