For the period from 1990 to 2015, the model mean forcing is
+0.06 W mâˆ’2, with a model range of the order of 50 around
this value.
In addition to the shorter-lived ozone precursors of NOx,
CO and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) changes in the
observed concentration of CH4 are taken into account, except
for the EMEP model. The ozone forcing estimate in IPCC
AR5 was based on simulations in Stevenson et al. (2013) and
for the period after 2005 on the Representative Concentra-
