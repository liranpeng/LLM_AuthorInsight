ent, with 20 %–40 % less ozone in this region. Additionally,
O3v2 enables the diagnosis of stratosphere–troposphere ex-
change ﬂux of ozone, a key budget term lacking in E3SMv1.
Here, we evaluate key features in ozone abundance and other
closely related quantities in atmosphere-only E3SMv1 simu-
lations driven by observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs,
years 1990–2014), comparing them with satellite observa-
tions of ozone and also with the University of California,
