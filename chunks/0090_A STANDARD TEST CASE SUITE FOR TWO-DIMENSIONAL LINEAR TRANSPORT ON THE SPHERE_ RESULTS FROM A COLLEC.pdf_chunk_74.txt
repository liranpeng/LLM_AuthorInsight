where D/Dt is the total or material derivative and A(t)
is a Lagrangian volume for which, by deﬁnition, there
is no ﬂux of mass across its boundaries. Lagrangian and
semi-Lagrangian ﬁnite-volume schemes are also referred to
as cell-integrated schemes (Nair and Machenhauer, 2002).
In semi-Lagrangian ﬁnite-volume schemes, the same La-
grangian areas are only traced/retained for one time step,
whereas for fully Lagrangian schemes the cells move with
