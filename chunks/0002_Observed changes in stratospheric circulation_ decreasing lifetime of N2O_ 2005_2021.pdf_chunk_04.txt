the stratospheric overturning circulation over the 21st cen-
tury (Abalos et al., 2021). This three-dimensional circula-
tion, condensed into a two-dimensional framework called
the Brewerâ€“Dobson circulation (BDC), brings tropospheric
air into the tropical stratosphere where it ascends, being
photochemically processed with ultraviolet radiation that in-
creases with altitude, mixes across latitudes, and then de-
scends at mid to high latitudes, re-entering the troposphere
