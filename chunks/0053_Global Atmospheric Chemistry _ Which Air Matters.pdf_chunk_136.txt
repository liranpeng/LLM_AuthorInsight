cussion of Fig. 6 above.
These plots include all altitudes that can be sampled by the
ATom ﬂights. When comparisons with ATom data are made,
it will be useful to identify discrepancies in the 2-D plots by
separating altitude regions.
The 2-D plots can change the emphasis of certain regions
when weighted by reactivity. For example, we take the GMI-
CTM modeled NOx–HOOH density (Fig. 6a, panel E) and
show the reactivity weightings in Fig. 7. With AIR weight-
