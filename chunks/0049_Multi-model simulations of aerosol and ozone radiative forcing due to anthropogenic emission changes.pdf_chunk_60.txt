Ozone forcing
The subset of ﬁve models that simulated ozone changes and
their resulting radiative forcing all show positive RF over the
entire time period. The multi-model mean forcing is twice
the IPCC AR5 estimate; see Fig. 7. Three models that used
ﬁxed meteorology simulate a relatively stable ozone forcing
increase, while the other two models show that interannual
variability contributed noise to the calculation of this forcing.
