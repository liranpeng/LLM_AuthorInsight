Five days vs. 5-day mean
The variability of the ﬁve days in August tells us about the
synoptic variability of clouds and possibly O3 columns in
each model. The rms difference between the ﬁve individual
days and the 5-day mean for each model (Table 3c) shows
that GISS and NCAR have much larger variability in reac-
tivities, caused by and mirrored by those in J-values. These
