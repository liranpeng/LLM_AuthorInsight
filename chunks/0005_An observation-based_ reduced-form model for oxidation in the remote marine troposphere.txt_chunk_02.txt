Significance The hydroxyl radical (OH) controls tropospheric methane loss rates. Global or hemispheric annual mean methane loss rates are currently inferred from observations of well-mixed gases, such as methyl chloroform. The short OH lifetime (1 to 2 s) and associated sharp spatiotemporal variations limit constraints on global models and understanding of “why” globally integrated OH fluctuates. From airborne measurements and steady-state chemistry, we develop a proxy to infer OH spatial
