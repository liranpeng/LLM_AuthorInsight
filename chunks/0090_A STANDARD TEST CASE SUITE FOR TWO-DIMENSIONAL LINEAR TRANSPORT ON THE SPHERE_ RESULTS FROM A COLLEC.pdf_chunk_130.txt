from sub-optimal convergence to asymptotic convergence
rates at different resolutions. Some models converge at full
order for ℓ2 already at the lower end of the resolution
range for which we assess numerical convergence (e.g.,
CAM-FV, CCSRG, CSLAM, HEL, HEL-ND, FARSIGHT-
CN10.4, SBC, SFF-CSLAM3, UCISOM, UCISOM-CS),
whereas other schemes reach “optimal” convergence rates
at ﬁner resolutions (e.g., CLAW, CAM-SE, FARSIGHT-
CN1.0, HOMME, SFF-CSLAM4, SLFV-ML/SL, MPAS,
