The same deposition scheme and values were used in the emission-driven runs.
WACCM6. WACCM656 is the whole atmosphere version of the Community
Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) run with 88 vertical levels and 1.875° × 2.5°
horizontal resolution. It fully represents the meridional overturning circulation of
the stratosphere, as well as full tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, with
interactive oxidants and ozone. The deposition velocity is computed within the
