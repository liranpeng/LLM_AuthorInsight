der CMIP5 to quantify the central estimate and range of
historical to present-day aerosol forcing. Future forcing es-
timates relied solely on ACCMIP (Shindell et al., 2013a).
It was problematic in CMIP5 to properly quantify the ERF
by aerosols in the historic period and future scenarios, in
most GCM models. This was mainly due to missing experi-
ments, diagnostics and insufÔ¨Åciently characterised feedbacks
involving natural aerosols.
Since the ERF calculations for ozone (tropospheric and
