of successive sounding circles was offset by 15 min so as to
distribute the sondes through the period of circling. During
this time HALO also provided continuous active and passive
remote sensing of the cloud ﬁeld below. Flying 50 min “box”
patterns just above the estimated cloud base (usually near a
height of about 800 m, Fig. 3), the ATR provided additional
remote sensing, as well as in situ turbulence and cloud mi-
crophysical measurements. After two to three box patterns,
