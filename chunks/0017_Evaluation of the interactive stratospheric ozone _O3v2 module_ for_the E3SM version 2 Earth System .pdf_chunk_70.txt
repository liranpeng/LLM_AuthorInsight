namical conditions associated with the winter polar vortex
are similar in both EAM versions and remain relatively iso-
lated from the changes in the ozone chemistry, unlike the
changes in the lower stratospheric dynamics caused by the
O3v1–O3v2 changes near the tropopause discussed below.

STE ozone ﬂux
With O3v2 the E3SM model is able to diagnose the STE
ozone ﬂux (Tg O3 per year), which is a key budget term
for tropospheric O3. We can place constraints on the global
