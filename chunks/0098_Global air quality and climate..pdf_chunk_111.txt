Table S1, ESIz), should permit an assessment of whether a
climate change signal on pollution episodes can be cleanly
isolated from climate variability.

Projections of regional air quality changes over
the next century
The local response of surface O3 and PM to climate-driven
changes depends also on changing spatial patterns of pollutant
emissions (e.g., ref. 140, 141, 194, 205, 207, 285 and 288) and
thus is tied to the future emissions trajectories for greenhouse
