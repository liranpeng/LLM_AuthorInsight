parison that uses prescribed initial chemical composition of
air parcels, which we refer to as the modeling data stream.
We presuppose that we can accurately measure or other-
wise know atmospheric composition, and then ask if mod-
els calculate the same global chemical budgets for ozone
and methane. Our approach eliminates many of the factors
that drive model differences and allows us to focus on the
photochemical reactivities as integrated over a day. Instanta-
