multiply models and observations by 320 ppb. The synchronization point for each QBO cycle is chosen as 
the month when the zonal wind at 40 hPa shifts from westerly (negative) to easterly (positive) based on the 
Singapore sonde data (Newman, 2020). If we extend these graphs beyond ±14 months, the coherent signal 
of the QBO is lost. Since the NOAA ESRL data begins in 2001 and LMDz5 extends only to 2016, this work
