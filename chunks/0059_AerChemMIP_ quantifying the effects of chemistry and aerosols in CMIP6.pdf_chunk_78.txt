help to answer. These will also enable the community to
quantify whether NTCF emissions, which are primarily lo-
cated over Northern Hemisphere midlatitude land areas have
led to a larger climate response there, relative to forcing
from WMGHGs (Shindell, 2014). To distinguish between
the warming effects of ozone and the net cooling effect of
aerosols, further experiments separate the two groups. We
choose to allocate NOx to the ozone precursor group (as this
