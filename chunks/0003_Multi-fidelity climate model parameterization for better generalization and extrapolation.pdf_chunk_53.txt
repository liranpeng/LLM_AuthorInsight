tion extremes73, and an unrealistic equatorial wave spectrum
with a missing Maddenâ€“Julian oscillation (MJO)74. Therefore,
providing a framework to improve convection paramterization
within this region can help remedy these issues.
In Supplementary Information, we provide all longitude-
latitude variations of the MAE and R2 metrics for heat and
moisture tendencies for pressure levels: 259, 494 and 761 hPa
(figures 7 and 8). These results show a very similar behavior
