pected given the difference in resolution between the obser-
vations and model. The strong performance of GEOS-5 with
regards to the overall CO distribution and the timing of the
enhancements gives us conﬁdence in using tagged tracers to
identify the sources affecting the air sampled in ATom-1.
We ﬁnd that for most ﬂights the dominant contribution
to total CO is from non-biomass-burning sources, which in-
clude both fossil fuels and biofuels and oxidation of hydro-
