most polluted times (95th percentile). Similar to the EMEPâ€“
AirBase comparison, CASTNET sites are located in rural ar-
eas while AQS sites are generally in or near populated areas,
and thus we believe this difference is due to the titration of
O3 by NOx emissions and then the cumulative production of
O3 as polluted air disperses.
Overall, these comparisons show excellent agreement
across the networks, particularly in the high-O3 events. Fur-
