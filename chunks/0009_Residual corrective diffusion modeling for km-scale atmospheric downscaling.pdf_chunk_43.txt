contour annulus of winds above 16 ms−1. The UNet (Fig. 5b)
likewise fails to recover a closed contour, although it does helpfully
corrects approximately 50% of error in the large-scale windspeed
and structure compared to the target. CorrDiff (Fig. 5c) enhances
the UNet by adding spatial variability, but maintains similar
intensity.
