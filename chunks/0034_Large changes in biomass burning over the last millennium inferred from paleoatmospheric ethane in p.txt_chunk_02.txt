Significance Biomass burning influences the climate system through direct emissions of aerosols, greenhouse gases, and chemically reactive gases. There is uncertainty and controversy regarding variations in past biomass burning, making it difficult to establish the climate sensitivity of biomass burning in current climate models. This study presents new measurements of ethane in air trapped in polar ice cores. The results indicate that biomass burning emissions exceeded modern levels during the
