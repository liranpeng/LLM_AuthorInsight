ter accounting for different lightning assumptions, demon-
strates that our simple parametric model represents the ma-
jor chemistry-climate interactions and uncertainties affecting
methane in current GCMs. This supports using the paramet-
ric model for climate scenarios where a large ensemble of
GCMs with chemistry is not available and too costly to gen-
erate.
