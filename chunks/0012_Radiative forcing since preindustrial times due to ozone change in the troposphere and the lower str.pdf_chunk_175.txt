spheric and stratospheric chemistry. The stratospheric bur-
den is reduced by between 12.6 DU and 16.1 DU in these
models. The inclusion of climate change yields larger tro-
pospheric ozone increases in most models, especially in the
models with both tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry.
This points to a dominance of the positive effect from in-
creased stratosphere-troposphere exchange and possibly in-
creased lightning emissions over the negative effect of in-
