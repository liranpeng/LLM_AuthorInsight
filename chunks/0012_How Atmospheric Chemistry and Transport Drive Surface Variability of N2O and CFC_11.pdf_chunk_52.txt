high levels of N2O at 10 hPa in the tropics where most of the loss occurs. It is interesting that LMDz5 and 
UCI have the largest difference since both models are using ECMWF meteorology, but in different forms 
(ERA-Interim vs. IFS cycle38r1 forecasts). If we drop all the model values by 0.02%/yr to account for bias of 
N2OX loss versus a surface forced N2O (see example with UCI CTM; Section 2.2 and Table 2), then MLS falls
