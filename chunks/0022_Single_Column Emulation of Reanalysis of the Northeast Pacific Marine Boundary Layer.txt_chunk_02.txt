An artificial neural network is trained to reproduce thermodynamic tendencies and boundary layer properties from European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5th Generation high resolution realization reanalysis data over the summertime northeast Pacific stratocumulus to trade cumulus transition region. The network is trained prognostically using 7‐day forecasts rather than using diagnosed instantaneous tendencies alone. The resulting model, Machine‐Assisted Reanalysis Boundary
