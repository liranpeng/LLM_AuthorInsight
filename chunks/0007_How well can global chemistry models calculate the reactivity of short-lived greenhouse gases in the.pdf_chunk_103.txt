we demonstrate a second major use: detailed diagnostics of
model performance, speciﬁc to the photochemical modules
operating within the global chemistry-climate and chemistry-
transport models. Six such models are evaluated here, and
their differences and similarities in simulating the chem-
istry are clearly identiﬁed. The protocol speciﬁes the detailed
chemical composition of a constrained set of air parcels in-
cluding temperature and water vapor, embeds these parcels
