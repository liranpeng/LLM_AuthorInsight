values. We identiﬁed this problem in P2018 and thought it
was solved, but perhaps it is not. Inclusion of the F0AM
model with its extensive hydrocarbon oxidation mechanism
provided an interesting contrast with the simpler chemistry in
the global CCM/CTMs. For a better comparison of the chem-
ical mechanisms, we should have F0AM use 5 d of photoly-
sis ﬁelds from one of the CTMs. The anomalous GISS re-
