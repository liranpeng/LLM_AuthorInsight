out of the boundary layer due to Monsoon activity. For the future
A1B_HIGH simulations, there is a substantial increase in the area of
exceedences to w25% of the region for 2025, remaining essentially
unchanged for 2050. This is due to the large increases in emissions
from the NTS related to e.g. energy production, construction and
industrial manufacturing, with the trend in NTS emissions showing
a doubling by 2025 followed by a reduction to w150% of the A1B
