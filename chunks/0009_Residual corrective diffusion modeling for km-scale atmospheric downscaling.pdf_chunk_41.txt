complicated, helpfully revealing the limitations of CorrDiff for
representing extreme events. Not only are typhoons extremely rare
in our training data, but the average radius of maximum winds of a
tropical cyclone is less than 100 km such that at the 25 km
resolution of our input data tropical cyclones are only partially
resolved. This leads to cyclonic structures that are too wide in
horizontal extent and too weak in wind intensity compared with
