cally leads to the titration of ozone. In addition the ozone
production efﬁciency can be increased by reduced NOx emis-
sions under high NOx conditions leading to a higher ozone
productivity per emitted NOx.
Matthes et al. (2007) and Niemeier et al. (2006) ﬁnd larger
relative ozone perturbations due to road trafﬁc of about 10%
for some regions in the northern hemisphere boundary layer
performing similar model simulations. Part of the deviations
