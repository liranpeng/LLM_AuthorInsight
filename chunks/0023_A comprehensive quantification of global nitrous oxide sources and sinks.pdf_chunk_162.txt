ries using default emission factors show large uncertainties at local 
to global scales, especially for agricultural N2O emissions, due to the 
poorly captured dependence of emission factors on spatial diversity in 
climate, management, and soil physical and biochemical conditions2,22. 
It is well known, for example from the IPCC guidelines, that higher-tier 
greenhouse-gas inventories may provide more reasonable estimates 
by using the alternative emission factors that are disaggregated by
