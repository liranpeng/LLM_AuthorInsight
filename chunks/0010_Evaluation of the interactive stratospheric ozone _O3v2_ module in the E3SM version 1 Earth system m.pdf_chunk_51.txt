perior representation of the high-latitude SCO. For [2], the
root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) (represented by the radius
of the arcs centered on the (1,0) point) are similar for UCI
CTM and O3v1 (radius of 0.75 SD) and best for O3v2 (radius
of 0.50). There is no clear explanation of this improvement in
O3v2 except perhaps that the reduction in lower stratospheric
O3 changed the wave propagation and variability seen in the
southern latitudes. These two metrics are clearly independent
