Models and Simulations
[7] Many different models have been used in the TF HTAP
assessment of the hemispheric transport of pollutants; the
subset of 15 models used in the present work are described
briefly in Table S11 (further details are at http://www.htap.
org). Many of the models have been used in previous assess-
ments of deposition fluxes [Dentener et al., 2006]. Emissions
of precursor gases (NOx, CO, volatile organic compounds
excluding methane, referred to as NMVOC and SO2) were not
