including extreme episodes, at least in some populated regions.
We note that some regions may be particularly sensitive to
large feedbacks from natural O3 and aerosol sources, such as
wildﬁres, dust, and biogenic precursors and from changes in
chemical and depositional sinks.199–205 For example, Southern
Europe may be particularly sensitive to climate change due to
vegetative feedbacks including increased biogenic VOC emis-
sions and decreased dry deposition when heat leads to closure
