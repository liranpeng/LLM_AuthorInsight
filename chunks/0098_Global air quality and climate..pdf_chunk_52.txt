estimate84 linked to satellite observations quantiﬁed the aerosol
indirect eﬀect as 0.7  0.45 W m2. Very little is known on the
contribution of diﬀerent aerosol components to the aerosol
indirect eﬀect. While several studies have quantiﬁed the cloud
albedo radiative eﬀect of BC-containing particles,82,85–89 the
sign of the cloud forcing is model-dependent and varies with
the BC to OC mass ratio, the size of emitted particles, and the
magnitude of the emission change.
