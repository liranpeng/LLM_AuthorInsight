relative contribution to the total uncertainty for each term, and the source for the
spread can be found in Table 1 below. For the soil sink speciﬁcally, we report a
symmetric uncertainty range of ±15 Tg yr−1 around our model mean of
59 Tg yr−1. This does not completely cover the interval stated in Ehhalt and
Rohrer5. If we assume that the interval in Ehhalt and Rohrer5 of 60 þ30
20 Tg yr−1 is a
90% conﬁdence interval (this is not explicitly stated in the paper), the range is well
