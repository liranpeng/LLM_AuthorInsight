posphere, where CH4 dominates the chemistry and controls
much of the OH loss. The value of sOH drops to below âˆ’0.1
in the upper troposphere, where cold temperatures make the
OH + CH4 reaction very slow compared with the OH + CO
reaction. The CH4 feedback factor describes the increase in
the timescale for a CH4 perturbation relative to the OH life-
time in steady state (i.e., the OH lifetime is the atmospheric
burden divided by loss to OH reactions).
