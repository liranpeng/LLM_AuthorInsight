the troposphere. If we can ﬁnd a way of treating the O2 heat-
ing separately, then the effort to ﬁnd an abbreviated number
of spectral intervals can focus on water vapor.

Conclusions
We present a new solar radiation module. Solar-J version 7.5
aims for consistent calculation of atmospheric photolysis and
solar heating rates by combining the strengths of both Cloud-
J and RRTMG-SW. In a chemistry–climate model, Solar-J
supplies the needs of solar heating of the atmosphere and
