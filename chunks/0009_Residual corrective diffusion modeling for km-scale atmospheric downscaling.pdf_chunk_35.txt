upward motion leads to cooling, condensation and ultimately
rainfall. That is, these physics should manifest as multi-variate
relationships with linked fine scale structures of two wind vector
components and temperature that should co-locate with radar
reflectivity.
FigureÂ 4 shows an example of CorrDiff downscaling a cold front.
Examining the target data (WRF in third column), the position of
the front is clearly visible in the southeast portion of the domain,
