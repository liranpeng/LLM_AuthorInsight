cially in the tropospheric forcings. In the stratosphere, and
for ULAQ in particular, there is some disagreement in the
net forcing, which is, however, the sum of the two large LW
and SW contributions of opposite sign, which themselves
agree rather well. Also, it has to be noted that, related to
extrapolation procedures, UiO-RTM took into account ozone
changes up to about 42 km (which is the upper boundary of
the ECMWF model layer being used in the UiO-RTM) while
