chemical statistics, Yu et al. (2016) used 60 s data (∼12 km)
from the SEAC4RS aircraft mission to compare cumulative
probability densities (PDs) of NOx, O3, HCHO and isoprene
over the Southeast US with the GEOS-Chem CTM run at
different resolutions. They identiﬁed clear biases at the high
and low ends of the distribution, providing a new test of mod-
els based on the statistics rather than mean values. Heald
et al. (2011) gathered high-resolution proﬁling of organic
