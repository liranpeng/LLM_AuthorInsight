Soden, 2007; Lu et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2012; Levine and
Schneider, 2011; Williamson et al., 2013; Seo et al., 2014;
Kang et al., 2013). While these studies posit that the weaken-
ing of the Hadley cell is related to a weakening of the merid-
ional temperature gradient between the tropics and subtrop-
ics, other studies have invoked thermodynamic constraints
to suggest that convective mass ï¬‚uxes throughout the trop-
ics may decrease in response to increasing greenhouse gases
