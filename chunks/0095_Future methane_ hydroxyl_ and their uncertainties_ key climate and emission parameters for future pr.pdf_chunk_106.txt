is −2.2 ± 1.8 % in our model, or −0.12 % yr−1 from a lin-
ear ﬁt. Dentener et al. (2003), simulated a larger decrease,
−0.2 % yr−1, in the 1980s that they attributed mainly to wa-
ter vapor. Meteorological inputs may contribute to the dif-
ference, since water vapor trends are known to vary amongst
reanalysis products (Trenberth et al., 2011). In addition, the
shift of anthropogenic emissions to SE Asia, which alters the
sensitivity of τCH4×OH to emissions is not treated in the para-
