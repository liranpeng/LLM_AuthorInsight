highly variable with deployment, showing that ATom-14 (the
more reactive periods) lacks dry air with RHw < 20 %, con-
sistent with the sensitivity to H2O and the high reactivities
noted above. For convenience in model comparisons, a tabu-
lated version of the CO, O3, and RHw PDs, giving values for
the 5th, 20th, 50th, 80th, and 95th percentiles for each basin
and deployment, is provided in Table 5.
