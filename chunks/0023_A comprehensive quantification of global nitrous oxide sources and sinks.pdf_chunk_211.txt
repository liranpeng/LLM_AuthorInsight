effect of reduced mature forest area (that is, deforestation) and shaded areas 
show minimum and maximum estimates; the red line represents the mean N2O 
emission from the post-deforestation pulse effect (that is, crop/pasture N2O 
emissions from legacy nitrogen of previous forest soil, not accounting for new 
fertilizer nitrogen added to these crop/pasture lands) and shaded areas show 
minimum and maximum estimates; the grey line represents the mean net
