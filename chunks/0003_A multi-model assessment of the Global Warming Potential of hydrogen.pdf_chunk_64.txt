radiative forcing directly due to the increase in hydrogen can be calculated. As the
methane concentration is Ô¨Åxed at the surface in these simulations, we need the
additional methane experiment, PERT_CH4, to calculate the change in
atmospheric composition and radiative forcing due to the change in the methane
lifetime in PERT_H2.
Five models (see model description below and Table 2) have run these
simulations with prescribed hydrogen and methane concentrations at the surface.
