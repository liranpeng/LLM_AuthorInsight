ciﬁc basin, as well as 2D probability densities (PDs) for key
species such as NOx (NO + NO2) versus HOOH. A large
part of the model differences was attributed to the large dif-
ferences found in chemical composition. We found that sin-
gle transects from a model through the tropical Paciﬁc at dif-
ferent longitudes produced nearly identical 2D PDs, but these
PDs were distinctly different across models. This result sup-
ported the premise that the ATom PDs would provide a useful
