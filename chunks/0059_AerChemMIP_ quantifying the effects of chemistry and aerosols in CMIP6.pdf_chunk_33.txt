AR4 (Flato et al., 2013). The importance of “whole atmo-
sphere” chemistry–climate coupling for the climate effects
of ozone has also been recently highlighted, since changes in
stratospheric ozone abundances, e.g. due to changes in ozone
depleting substances, can affect tropospheric ozone through
stratosphere-to-troposphere exchange (Shindell et al., 2013b;
Banerjee et al., 2016).
The radiative forcing from historical aerosol emissions
was quantiﬁed on the basis of one model (Langner and
