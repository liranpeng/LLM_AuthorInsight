Notes:
RCPn.n HFC abundances (Tables AII.4.8 to AII.4.15) are as reported (Meinshausen et al., 2011a). SRES A2 and B1 and IS92a (where available) are taken from TAR Appendix II. Observed values are 
shown for 2011 (see Chapter 2, and Table AII.1.1). The AR5 RCPn.n& abundances are calculated starting with observed abundances (adopted for 2010) and future tropospheric OH changes using
