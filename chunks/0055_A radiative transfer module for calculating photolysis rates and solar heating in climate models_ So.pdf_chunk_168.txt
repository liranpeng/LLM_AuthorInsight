putational costs across modules to have comparable (small)
errors in all. In addition, these parameterization errors need
to be evaluated for the impact they might have on climate
simulations (e.g., Pincus et al., 2003). For Solar-J, the next
steps consist of (i) moving the S17–S18 boundary to the be-
ginning of the O3 Chappuis absorption near 0.5 µm, and (ii)
developing a more realistic and diverse range of cirrus clouds
and their optical properties (e.g., Yang et al., 2015).
