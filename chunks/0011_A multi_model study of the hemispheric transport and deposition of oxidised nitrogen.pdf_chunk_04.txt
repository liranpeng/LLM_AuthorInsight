[Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006]. Deposition of these com-
pounds to water and soils is an important source of nutrients
for many ecosystems. However, human activities, such as
the burning of fossil fuels (which produce nitrogen oxides,
NOx, the sum of NO and NO2), have significantly perturbed
the natural nitrogen cycle [Galloway et al., 2004]. The NOx
emitted undergoes rapid reaction to form the various NOy
species. Excessive deposition of nitrogen to ecosystems can
