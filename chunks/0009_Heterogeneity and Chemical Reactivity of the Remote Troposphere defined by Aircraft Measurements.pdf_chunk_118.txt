activities are seen in the mean values displayed in the legend
(e.g., CPac with 1.29 ppb/d L-O3 versus ATom (i.e., CPac
+ EPac) with 1.54 ppb/d), but the PDs (gray circles versus
black circles) resemble each other more closely than any of
the models.
The ability to test a model’s reactivity statistics with the
ATom 10 s data is not obvious, but the PDs based on 1◦
latitude by 200 m altitude cells (the black Xs) is remark-
ably close to the PDs based on 2 km (horizontal) by 80 m
