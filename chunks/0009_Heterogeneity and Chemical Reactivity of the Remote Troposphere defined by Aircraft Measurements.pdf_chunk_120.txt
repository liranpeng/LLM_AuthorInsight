geneity in the atmosphere, which for the oceanic transects
is, we believe, adequately resolved by the 10 s ATom mea-
surements. Perhaps more surprising, given the different mean
proﬁles in Fig. 3, is that the ﬁve model PDs in Fig. 5 look
very much alike. This points to some signiﬁcant underlying
difference between our current global chemistry models and
the ATom observations.
