latitudinal pattern of CO2 IAV may similarly provide infor-
mation on its cause. Comparing tropics to extratropics in the
SH (SPO+CGO vs. SMO, solid and dotted black lines in
Fig. 1d), I Ô¨Ånd remarkably similar patterns after 1990, with
similar amplitudes and some phase shifts of at most 1 year. If
I add the NH tropics MLO IAV (not shown), the pattern and
amplitude are similar. When the sites are in sync, one can
only presume that the CO2 perturbation is tied to changes in
