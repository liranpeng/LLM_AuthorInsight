Sensitivity of rlnJ to small cloud optical depth
To relate total COD to a shift in rlnJ, the UCI off-line pho-
tolysis module Cloud-J was run for marine stratus (CF = 1)
with a range of total CODs from 0.01 to 100. The cloud
was located at about 900 hPa and rlnJ evaluated at 300 hPa.
The plot of rlnJ vs. log COD for a range of SZAs is shown
in Fig. S8. A 10 % enhancement (rlnJ = +0.10) occurs at
COD = 5 for J-O1D and COD = 3 for J-NO2, demonstrat-
