tal uncertainty in prescribing the mix of crystal habits over the wide atmospheric range of ice clouds. 
With the recent work by Yang and colleagues (e.g., 2013, 2018) quantifying the scattering, and the better 
atmospheric data from Heymsfield and colleagues (e.g., 2017), we are in a position to remove ice-cloud 
parameterizations and apply the ice-cloud physics directly to solar RT codes. Two recent efforts to do this
