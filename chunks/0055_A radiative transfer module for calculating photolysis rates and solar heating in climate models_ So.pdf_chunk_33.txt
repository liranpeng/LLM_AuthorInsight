cross sections) are lumped into one more sub-bin and added
to Solar-J’s Chappuis band. In all, we took RRTMG’s 14 sub-
bins from B24 and B25 and optimized these into 5 sub-bins
for S18. The last 9 bins, S19–S27, are directly implemented
from RRTMG and contain 78 sub-bins. The logic of having
wavelength bins and then sub-bins within them is to allow
the gaseous absorbers with similar opacities to be gathered
into one sub-bin but to treat the scattering and absorption
