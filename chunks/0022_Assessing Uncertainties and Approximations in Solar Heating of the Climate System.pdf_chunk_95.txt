Approximating Rayleigh scattering as isotropic, required in all 2-stream codes, fortunately has inconse-
quential errors: all three global mean error metrics (reflection, atmospheric absorption, surface heating) are 
measurable but within ±0.01 W m−2 (T1/R17). There is little systematic geographic or zenith angle errors 
since the root-mean-square (rms) errors are ≤0.1 W m−2. This test was done with the 8-stream code.
