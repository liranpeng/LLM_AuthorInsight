vides a picture of the dominant sources affecting the con-
stituent concentrations observed during ATom-1 for different
regions of the atmosphere. The tagging of CO sources in-
cludes both BB and non-BB from four continental areas, with
all other sources put into the “other” bin. Other BB sources
are small, but other non-BB sources are quite large as they in-
clude all natural sources as well as atmospheric photochem-
ical sources such as methane oxidation.
