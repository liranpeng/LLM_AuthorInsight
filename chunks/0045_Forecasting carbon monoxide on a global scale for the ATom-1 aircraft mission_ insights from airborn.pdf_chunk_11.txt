broader geographic region but noted that year-to-year and El
Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability could also be
important. Year-to-year variability in meteorology and emis-
sions both contribute to interannual variability in trace gases
and aerosols, so it is important to consider the temporal rep-
resentativeness of a single season sampled by ATom. For ex-
