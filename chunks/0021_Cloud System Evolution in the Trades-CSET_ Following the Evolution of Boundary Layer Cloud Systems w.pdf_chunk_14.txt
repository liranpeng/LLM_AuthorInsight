structure containing cumulus clouds with greatly reduced cover capped by a weaker and 
more diffuse inversion.
Cloud top entrainment is one of the key processes driving the stratocumulus-to-cumulus 
transition. The MBL deepening associated with entrainment causes decoupling: the 
separation of the MBL into two distinct layers with limited exchange between them.
