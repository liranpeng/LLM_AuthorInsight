is recovered after each Euler time step in the
Runge–Kutta method. The quasi-monotone limiter (shape-
preserving ﬁlter) for φ is based on an optimization problem
with equality and inequality constraints (Taylor et al., 2009;
Guba et al., 2013).
There is a signiﬁcant dependency of the simulation quality
