bined. The analysis can be extended to the Atlantic. CAFS
or similar measurements from other aircraft missions could
also be added. Other tasks involve tightening the spread
in rlnJ by looking for potential measurement–model noise
(e.g., aircraft–sun orientation, sun–cloud geometries) and by
improving the TUV clear-sky modeling (e.g., a more ac-
curate ocean surface albedo derived from observed surface
wind, chlorophyll, SZA). An unresolved issue is how to treat
