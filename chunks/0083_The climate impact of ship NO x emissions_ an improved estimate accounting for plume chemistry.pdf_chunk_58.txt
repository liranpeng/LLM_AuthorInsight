(Prather et al., 2012). While the ﬁxed OPE model is longer
(9.7 yr), it cannot be considered more realistic. Neglecting all
ship NOx emissions, the CH4 lifetime is 9.8 yr. Thus, with
parametric plume chemistry, ship NOx drives about 4 % of
all CH4 oxidation by tropospheric OH and 13 % of that oc-
curs in the ﬁrst 5 h of plume aging. Our results here include
bromine chemistry, which acts as an O3 and HOx sink. Re-
moving bromine chemistry from a simulation with ﬁxed OPE
