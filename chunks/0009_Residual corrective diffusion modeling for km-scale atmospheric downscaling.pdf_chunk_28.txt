Optimizing the stochastic calibration of CorrDiff is a logical area for
future development.

Calibration is evaluated using spread skill ratios and rank
histograms based on the same validation set used in Fig. 1 and
Table 1. a, c, e, g show the ensemble standard deviation as a
function of the RSME of mean prediction for 10-m eastward wind,
radar reflectivity, 10-m northward wind and 2-m temperature,
