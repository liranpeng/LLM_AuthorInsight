Decoupling that starves the Sc of their surface moisture source and increased entrainment of 
dry air into the MBL due to more energetic cumulus plumes lead to their breakup. They are 
replaced by broken Cu whose tops are more variable, with a greater spread of cloud top 
height and fewer reaching the inversion. Cloud top entrainment profoundly impacts the type 
and coverage of clouds within the MBL because it plays such an important role in the MBL
