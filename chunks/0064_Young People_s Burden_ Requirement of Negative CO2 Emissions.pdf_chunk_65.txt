The dominant human-caused drivers of climate change are
changes of atmospheric GHGs and aerosols (Fig. 4). GHGs
absorb Earth’s infrared (heat) radiation, thus serving as a
“blanket” warms Earth’s surface by reducing heat radiation
to space. Aerosols, ﬁne particles/droplets in the air that cause
visible air pollution, both reﬂect and absorb solar radia-
tion, but reﬂection of solar energy to space is their domi-
nant effect, so they cause a cooling that partly offsets GHG
