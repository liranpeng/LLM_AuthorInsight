assessment approach would be to evaluate each of them sep-
arately using observations and an ensemble of models (e.g.,
HTAP, 2010; Kirtman et al., 2013). This paper focuses on
factor (3), providing clear measures of bias and skill in global
chemistry models run in hindcast mode, and developing cli-
matologies that can be used to test climate models and to
detect a climatic shift in AQX episodes.
The approach developed here establishes a reliable method
