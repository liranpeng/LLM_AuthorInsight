Data sets and methods
In the ACCMIP model intercomparison, four global CCMs
included a CO-like tracer emitted from global sources:
UM-CAM, GISS-E2-R, CMAM, and STOC-HadAM3.
A description of these models, including their chemistry,
transport, and conﬁguration, can be found in Lamarque
et al. (2013) and Young et al. (2013). The horizontal resolu-
tion of the models varied between 1.875◦by 2.5◦and 5◦by
5◦. Two of the models, UM-CAM and STOC-HadAM3, have
