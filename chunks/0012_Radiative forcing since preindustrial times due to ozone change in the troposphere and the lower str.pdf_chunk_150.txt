Fig. 8. Components of global-mean adjusted radiative forcing (Wm−2) between 1850 and 2000. “SW”: shortwave component, “LW”:
longwave component, “trop”: due to tropospheric ozone change, “strat” due to stratospheric change. (a) “2 minus 1c” (for LMDzINCA,
UM CAM, and STOCHEM HadAM3 “2 minus 1b” is shown), (b) “2 minus 1” (for UM CAM “2 minus 1d” is shown). Radiative forcing
