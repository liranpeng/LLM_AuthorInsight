with L-CH4 being at lower altitude than L-O3 (all models
except GISS). There is a region of top P -O3 parcels about
40◦N that extends into the lower troposphere, although the
shape varies across models. The vertical pattern of top-10 %
parcels about 22◦S clearly varies across models with GISS-
GC-UCI not selecting these parcels.
Overlap of these three sets of parcels are quantiﬁed as
Venn diagrams for each model in Fig. 6. Very few top-10
