underlying patterns of reactive gases.
Tropospheric O3 and CH4 contribute to climate warm-
ing and global air pollution (Stocker et al., 2013). Their
abundances in the troposphere are controlled largely by tro-
pospheric chemical reactions. Thus, chemistryâ€“climate as-
sessments seeking to understand past global change and
make future projections for these greenhouse gases have fo-
cused on the average tropospheric rates of production and
