and the US as possible, we select the value of QP = 0.67
as the cutoff for our masks. Figure 1 shows the constructed
masks (gray boxes) for the EPA (Fig. 1a) and combined EU
(Fig. 1b). When comparing the EU observations with the UCI
CTM, we truncate the mask northward of 65â—¦N. Note that
the mask over the US excludes parts of Montana that are
too distant from sites. Figure S1 in the Supplement shows
the logarithm of QP values for all of the retained grid cells
