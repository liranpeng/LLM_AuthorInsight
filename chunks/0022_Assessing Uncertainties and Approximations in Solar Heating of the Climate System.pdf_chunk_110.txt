picture of atmospheric reflection caused by δ-1 scaling of liquid clouds (Figure 4aiii) is consistent with 
LBYY's Figure 2 row iii, which shows a large shift from increased reflection (high sun) to reduced (low sun), 
as does (Räisänen's [2002], Figure 2). The LBYY examples in their Figures 2 and 3 are quite informative: For 
the 4 cases (liquid & ice, reflection & atmospheric absorption), only liquid-reflection shows a distinct pat-
