tude or longitude from the equations for the regular latitude–
longitude grid, and with nine-point Romberg integration for
the cubed-sphere grid (preserves mass convergence in each
grid cell to single-precision accuracy or better). The ﬂux over
each time step is integrated analytically from the equations.
UCISOM uses a single forward time step for any CN value,
and is thus only ﬁrst-order accurate in time (i.e., forward
Euler). The rate of convergence with increasing resolution
