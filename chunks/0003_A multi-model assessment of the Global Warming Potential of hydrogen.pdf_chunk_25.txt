ozone and stratospheric water vapor by increased hydrogen. Both
these effects are included in Fig. 3. An increase in methane

factor ranges from 1.36 to 1.55 (Supplementary Table 2) which is
a bit high compared to other multi-model studies 1.34 ± 0.0626
and 1.30 ± 0.0727. Our estimated hydrogen feedback is slightly
