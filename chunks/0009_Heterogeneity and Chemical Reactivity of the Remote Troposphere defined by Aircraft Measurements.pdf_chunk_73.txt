Our analysis of the reactivities uses the six-model RDS-0 re-
sults to examine the consistency in calculating the Rs across
models. Thereafter, we rely on the similar results from the
three central models (GC, GMI, UCI) to justify use of UCI
RDSâˆ—-2 as our best estimate for ATom reactivities. The un-
certainty in this estimate can be approximated by the inter-
