the US is about 104 km2, while that in EU northern latitudes
is about 0.6 × 104 km2. From size we can estimate two addi-
tional metrics – mean daily areal extent (km2) and duration
(days) of the episode. Since we only want the effective du-
ration (i.e., the time frame that includes the majority of the
episode), we do not take the total duration from ﬁrst to last
day. Instead, we deﬁne the duration of the peak episode to be
2 times the weighted standard deviation of the time indices,
