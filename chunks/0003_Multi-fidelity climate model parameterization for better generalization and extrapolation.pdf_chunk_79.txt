data distribution comparison, the CAM5 +8K is chosen as
low-fidelity model since it provides a significantly more pro-
nounced extrapolation beyond the regimes spanned by the
SPCAM5 training dataset compared to CAM5 +4K. This
property proves being crucial in obtaining skillful extrapo-
lation predictions when the multi-fidelity model is tested on
unseen SPCAM5 +4K data.
