1850 ﬁxed SST piClim-control as for the time-slice ERFs.
Each experiment parallels the 30-year control, except that
the emission ﬂuxes from an interactive parameterisation are
doubled (see Table 7). For models that do not interactively
parameterise particular emissions, the ﬂuxes from the 1850
climatological dataset should be doubled.
The radiative perturbation from these experiments will
give ERF per Tg yr−1 change in emissions. When scaled by
