or interhemispheric exchange. We see agreement across the models in SH STE using QBO composites, but 
the annual cycles are discordant. Thompson, Chevallier, et al. (2014) recorded widespread disagreement 
of N2O seasonality in the SH among six different models. We find here that the annual STE cycle in the 
SH is substantially different among three standard meteorological models (MERRA-2, ERA-Interim, ECM-
WF-IFS), while in the NH it is essentially the same.
