position. Comparing the dashed brown (UCI, RDS-0) and
black (UCIP, RDS∗-2) lines, we ﬁnd that the shift to observed
NOx and new HNO4+PAN protocol has introduced notice-
able changes only for P-O3: increasing reactivities overall
in the Paciﬁc while decreasing them slightly in the Atlantic.
From Table 2, these changes primarily affected mean P-O3
and were due primarily to the shift from MDS-0 to MDS-2
and secondarily to the RDS∗protocol, which reduced both
