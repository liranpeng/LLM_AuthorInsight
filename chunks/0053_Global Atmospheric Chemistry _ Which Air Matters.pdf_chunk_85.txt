sign) in the bias of A-runs relative to C-runs. Thus we can use
the model A-runs to tag each parcel in the ATom measured
climatology by its reactivity in the absence of emissions and
transport. Clearly these models have largely different chemi-
cal climatologies for the middle of the Paciﬁc, and, with the
ATom climatology to initialize all six models, we will be able
to test whether these differences reﬂect the initial key species
and/or the photochemical components.
