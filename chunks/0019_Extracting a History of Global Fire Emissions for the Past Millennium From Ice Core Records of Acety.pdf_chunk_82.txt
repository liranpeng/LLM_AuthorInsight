There are similarities in the inferred biomass burning emissions of acetylene, ethane, and methane over the
last 1,000 years in the four emission scenarios (Figure 3). There is a large decline in biomass burning
emissions for all three gases from the MP (1000–1500 CE) to the LIA (1650–1750 CE). The acetylene history
exhibits a 49–55% decline from the MP to the LIA with most of this due to a reduction in non‐boreal (tropi-
