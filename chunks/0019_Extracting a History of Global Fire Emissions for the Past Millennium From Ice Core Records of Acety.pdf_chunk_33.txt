global emissions around 3.4 Tg year−1 during the satellite era (1997–2017) (Giglio et al., 2013; van der
Werf et al., 2017). Geologic ethane emissions in the modern atmosphere are estimated at 2–4 Tg year−1
(Etiope & Ciccioli, 2009). However, the importance and magnitude of geologic hydrocarbons in the preindus-
trial atmosphere has been heavily debated based on measurements of radiocarbon‐free methane in ice cores
(Dyonisius et al., 2020; Hmiel et al., 2020; Petrenko et al., 2017).
