1.  Introduction
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a long-lived greenhouse gas that directly affects climate and participates in strato-

and society. Agricultural practices and fossil fuel combustion have played important roles in increasing 
the global burden of fixed nitrogen (Erisman et al., 2013), leading to a steady increase in atmospheric N2O
