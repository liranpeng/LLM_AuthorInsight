which occur during boreal summertime are reduced by w10% by
2050. For boreal wintertime, enhancements in near-surface O3 of
w30% occur as a result of less titration by nitric oxide. For other
regions, such as China and India, a degradation in air quality occurs
throughout the year across the timeline, where the projected
mitigation of anthropogenic NOx emissions by 2050 does not
necessarily result in a decrease in O3 mixing ratios.
By normalizing the seasonal multi-model ensemble means of
