must be considered, but interannual variability is also an im-
portant diagnostic that provides a key test for the CCMs
as well as a metric that can help assess the signiﬁcance of
changes between two different decades. This is especially
evident when each year’s individual CCDF is examined (see
Fig. S6 in the Supplement). In addition to climate variabil-
ity in AQX episodes, there is the problem of stationarity in
the observations due primarily to continuing mitigation of
