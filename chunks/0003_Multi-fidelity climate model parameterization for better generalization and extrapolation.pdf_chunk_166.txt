of the testing year are similar to those obtained for the period between February and May (figures 10.c and 10.f). Hence, the
temporal extrapolation for the vertical level 761 hPa seems to affect the error differently based on the unseen season among the
training dataset. Note that since the testing dataset corresponds to a climate simulation that was not considered in any of the
