tion input, while the second network (highlighted in blue in
figure 1) predicts the high-fidelity parameterization output as
a function of the low-fidelity parameterization output. The
trainable surrogate model of each member of the MF-RPN is
trained using a joint training of both networks (Methods).
Our MF-RPN learns the mappings between related physical
variables: emulating the parameterization (inputs to outputs)
at low-fidelity (red network in figure 1), and mapping the
