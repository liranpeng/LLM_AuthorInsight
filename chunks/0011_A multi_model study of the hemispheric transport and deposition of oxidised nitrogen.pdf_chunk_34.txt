hence more wet deposition and less export of NOy.
[15] The sensitivities of the NOy deposition fluxes in the
receptor regions when all anthropogenic emissions (CO,
NMVOC, and SO2, as well as NOx) are reduced by 20% in
each source region were also calculated (data not shown). A
comparison with the previous results shows that the mean
responses and uncertainties are generally similar, but not
identical to those given in Table 1. For most source-receptor
