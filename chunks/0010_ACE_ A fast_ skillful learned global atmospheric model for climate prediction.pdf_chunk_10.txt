Dataset
Most ML-based weather prediction systems have been trained on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset [10].
While appealing due to its relatively accurate representation of historical atmospheric conditions,
reanalysis data has downsides for the development of machine learning based climate models: it has
a limited number of samples restricted to the recent past; models trained on reanalysis may not be
