plume chemistry. The CTM now calculates O3 production
and CH4 loss both within and outside the exhaust plumes and
also accounts for the effect of wind speed. With the improved
modeling of plumes, ship NOx perturbations are smaller than
suggested by the ensemble of past global modeling studies,
but if we assume instant dilution of ship NOx on the grid
scale, the CTM reproduces previous model results. Our best
estimates of the RF components from increasing ship NOx
