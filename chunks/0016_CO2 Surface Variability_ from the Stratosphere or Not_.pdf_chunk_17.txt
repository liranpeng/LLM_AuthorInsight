for the historical period 1990–2017.
To study the circulation-driven IAV of CO2, including
STE, I focus on the Southern Hemisphere (SH) because
ﬂuctuations in the large biosphere-driven seasonality in the
Northern Hemisphere (NH) (Fig. 1a and b) will obscure any
stratosphere-driven IAV there. The UCI CTM uses ECMWF
integrated forecast ﬁelds at 1.1◦horizontal resolution and
has proven quite successful in simulating the historical IAV
of surface N2O, ozone columns, and the Antarctic ozone
