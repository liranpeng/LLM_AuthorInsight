Song et al., 2003). While the non-linear nature of NOx–HOx–
O3 chemistry in plumes is well known (e.g., Lin et al., 1988)
and numerical techniques have been developed for modeling
sub-grid-scale plumes from other sources (e.g., Paoli et al.,
2011; Sillman et al., 1990), many global CTMs have contin-
ued to use the instant dilution assumption for ship NOx while
acknowledging its deﬁciency. As a result, these models over-
estimate O3 and OH production by ships and generate biased
