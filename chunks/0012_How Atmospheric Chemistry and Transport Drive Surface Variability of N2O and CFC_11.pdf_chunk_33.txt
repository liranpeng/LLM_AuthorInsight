and so we rescale both the burden and chemical loss each month with the same factor so that the burden 
corresponds to our reference value of 320 ppb. With this scaling, the average N2O loss over the MLS period 
2005–2018 is 12.9 (interannual min-max ± 0.3) TgN/yr, corresponding to a global mean loss frequency of 
about 0.84%/yr.
Figure 1 compares our rescaled N2O loss derived from past and current MLS products (different retrieval
