face ozone and particulate matter in addition to deposition of
nitrate and sulfate and any interactions of atmospheric and
land-use changes. CMIP6 will provide comprehensive infor-
mation on the future large-scale evolution of atmospheric
composition, thus updating the knowledge base used to man-
age air pollution.
The Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison
Project, AerChemMIP, contributes to CMIP6 by diagnos-
ing climate forcings and feedbacks involving NTCFs and
