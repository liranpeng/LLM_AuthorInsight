those mediated by water vapor. We estimate the 100-yr GWP
to be 32, which is 25 % larger than past assessments.

Introduction
Rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are
the main cause of current and future climate change (In-
tergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, hereafter IPCC,
2007). Uncertainty in mapping an emission scenario onto
future abundance of greenhouse gases (GHGs) thus trans-
lates almost directly into uncertainty in our ability to project
