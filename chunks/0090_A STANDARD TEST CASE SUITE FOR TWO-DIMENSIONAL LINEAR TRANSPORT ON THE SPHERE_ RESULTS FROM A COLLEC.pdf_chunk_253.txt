To assess absolute errors and to challenge the schemes with
a slightly less smooth initial condition (C1), modelers were
asked which resolution was needed to provide solutions at
a certain level of accuracy (deﬁned in terms of a root mean
square error norm). This resolution was referred to as “min-
imal resolution” (1λm). The range of 1λ varied from ap-
proximately 0.1◦to more than 2◦. The schemes have been
ordered according to increasing 1λm when other accuracy
