N2O loss was also a theme in Nevison et al. (1999), who
suggested that such changes might occur and be detectable
in the observed ratio of NOy (NO and its products) to N2O
in the lowermost stratosphere. Our results are consistent with
the analysis of Froidevaux et al. (2022), where the abundance
of NO and NO2 in the upper stratosphere is increasing at a
rate much lower than that of N2O (approximately 2 versus
12 %/decade). The abundance of NO in the tropical upper
