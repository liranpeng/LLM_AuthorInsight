variability clearly shows a QBO signal and is nearly identical across the three records, except when the 
640 GHz channel fails in the 2nd half of 2012. In the tropical lower-stratosphere, the downward propagating 
zonal winds of the QBO alternate direction every ∼28 months. The shear produced by descending winds 
can enhance or suppress transport of N2O to the middle stratosphere where it is destroyed (∼10 hPa), and 
thus generate a QBO signal in the loss of N2O.
