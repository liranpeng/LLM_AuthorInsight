1-D RT codes of RRTMG-SW or Solar-J. Comparisons be-
tween Solar-J and RRTMG-SW for clouds in Sect. 3 are done
with a single 1-D plane-parallel, ICA-like atmosphere (i.e.,
100 % cloud fraction in each cloud layer), an idealized case.
Although the different approaches for fractional cloud
cover were not directly tested here, it is worth looking at
how Solar-J and RRTMG might treat cloud Ô¨Åelds in cli-
mate models. The Monte Carlo ICA (McICA; Pincus et al.,
