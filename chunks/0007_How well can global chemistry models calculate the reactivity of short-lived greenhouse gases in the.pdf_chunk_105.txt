ferences in photochemistry from differences in emissions,
transport, scavenging, and even numerical methods, all of
which help deﬁne the mix of chemical species in each grid
cell. The new protocol established in this paper combines
the no-transport A-run from P2017 with the data stream of
speciﬁed-composition air parcels. The approach is generic
and can be implemented in any model. Here, using six global
chemistry-transport or chemistry-climate models, we can see
