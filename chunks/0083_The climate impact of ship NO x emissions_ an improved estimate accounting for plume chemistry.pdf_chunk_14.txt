impacts on climate and air quality. To date, all estimates of
RF due to ship NOx come from models that assume instant
dilution (Eyring et al., 2010).
Large-eddy simulations at various spatial resolutions sug-
gest the errors in surface O3 and OH enhancements caused
by instant dilution of ship emissions in global CTMs are as
large as 60 % (Charlton-Perez et al., 2009), although some
