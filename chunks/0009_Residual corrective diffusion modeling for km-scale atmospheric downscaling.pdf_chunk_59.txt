If some of the above challenges in the model are resolved, several
potential extensions of the proposed method are worth
consideration by the community:
1. 1.
Downscaling coarse-resolution medium-range forecasts: This
requires addressing lead time-dependent forecast errors in the
input, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of simultaneous
bias correction and downscaling, and adding temporal
coherence and km-scale prediction and data assimilation
capabilities.
