duct (Henne et al., 2012). TFA is water-soluble and can remain in
surface waters and the ocean for 40,000 years (Spatz and Minor,
2008). The rapid breakdown of HFC-1234yf in the atmosphere
suggests higher ambient TFA (and decay products) concentra-
tions than those of slower decaying HFCs and CFCs.
The critical review acknowledges the hazards of flammability
of different MAC refrigerants within vehicle cabs. Spatz and
Minor (2008) report that the flammability risk of injury or fatal-
