erator H.
The tangent linear operator can be derived explicitly by
the Ô¨Ånite-difference method, but it is a computationally ex-
pensive method. Instead, the tangent-linear operator can be
considered as a sequence of linearized sub-operators of the
non-linear observation operator and built piece by piece by
differentiating each line of code or loop separately. This ap-
proach allows the parts of the code to be tested separately.
In order to provide a linearized trajectory around the model
