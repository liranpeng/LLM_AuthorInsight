the UoR-RTM considered ozone changes only up to 30 km.
Additional calculations of both the ozone change since

provided by the Harvard University.
The Harvard-GISS
model is a version of the general circulation model (GCM)
developed at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS),
the GISS-GCM IIâ€² (Rind and Lerner, 1996; Rind et al.,

The model includes a detailed, on-line chemistry
