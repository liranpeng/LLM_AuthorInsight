vapor, anthropogenic NOx emissions, and methane feedback
on its OH sink are the major drivers of τCH4×OH in both the
historical reconstruction and future RCP 8.5 scenario.
We also provide a new estimate of the indirect compo-
nents of methane RF. Based on three CTMs, tropospheric
ozone contributes 30–50 % of the direct methane RF, com-
pared to 25 % that has been used in previous IPCC assess-
ments (Forster et al., 2007). Using one model with strato-
