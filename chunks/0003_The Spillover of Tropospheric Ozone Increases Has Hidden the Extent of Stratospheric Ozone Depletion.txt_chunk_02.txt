Stratospheric ozone depletion from halocarbons is partly countered by pollution‐driven increases in tropospheric ozone, with transport connecting the two. While recognizing this connection, the ozone assessment's evaluation of observations and processes have often split the chapters at the tropopause boundary. Using a chemistry‐transport model we find that air‐pollution ozone enhancements in the troposphere spill over into the stratosphere at significant rates, that is, 13%–34% of the excess
