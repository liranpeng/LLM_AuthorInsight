(Pincus et al., 2019). The Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CCCma) examined the im-
portance of expanded scattering phase functions for clouds and aerosols possible with a 4-stream RT code 
(Li et al., 2015, hence LBYY) as well as the use of satellite-derived cloudy atmospheres to compare 3-D RT 
with the 1-D climate model codes (H. W. Barker et al., 2012; 2015, hence B2015). The Korean Integrated
