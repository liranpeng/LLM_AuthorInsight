model deposition fluxes, and hence in the fractions of NOy
exported from a given region. For deposition to EU and NA,
wet deposition accounts for about 0.3â€“0.6 of the total. For
the two Asian regions (SA and EA), the wet deposition
fraction lies between 0.4 and 0.7, similar to the estimates
obtained by Lamarque et al. [2005]. The modelled deposi-
tion fluxes were found to be independent of the methane
