radiative forcing via aerosol-radiation-cloud interactions. We
have therefore calculated the direct and Ô¨Årst indirect radiative
forcing of aerosols for the models where this was possible, shown
as red bars in Fig. 3. In OsloCTM the global mean burden of
sulfate decreases from hydrogen emissions, but aqueous phase
reactions lead to more sulfate aerosols at low altitudes leading to a
strengthening in the indirect aerosol effect and overall negative
