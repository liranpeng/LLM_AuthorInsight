concentrations (CH4) or emissions (aerosol and ozone precursors). “Reference” means the concentrations or emissions should evolve as for
SSP3-7.0; “Clean” means the concentrations or emissions should evolve following a version of SSP3-7.0 with cleaner air quality policies.
CFC/HCFC concentrations should follow the SSP3-7.0 scenario in all cases. For ssp370SST-lowLu the land-use mask from the SSP1-2.6
