−0.25 W m−2 relative to today is plausible, but we must
note that this is a dramatic change from the growing abun-
dances, indeed accelerating growth, of these gases today.
Achievement of this suggested negative forcing requires
(i) successful completion of planned phase-out of MPTGs
(−0.23 W m−2), (ii) absolute reductions of CH4 forcing by
0.12 W m−2 from its present value, and (iii) N2O forcing
increasing by only 0.1 W m−2. Achieving this net negative
