that the single AOD assimilation cycle expands the proﬁle
but does not change its shape, something that multiple cy-
cles and the model propagation of the increment do. Fig. 9d
shows the back trajectories of air parcels at different heights
at the location corresponding to Fig. 9c, and conﬁrms that
the aerosols on different levels come from different direc-
tions and regions where they have been already assimilated
in previous cycles.
