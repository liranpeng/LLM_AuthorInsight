(ULAQ, DLR E39C, NCAR MACCM, and UIO CTM2).
In CHASER, stratospheric ozone trends are prescribed us-
ing the method of Randel and Wu (1999) with effec-
tive equivalent stratospheric chlorine loadings correspond-
ing to the speciÔ¨Åcations of this experiment (see Sect. 2.2).
FRSGC UCI uses linearized ozone chemistry following Mc
Linden et al. (2000). The other models prescribe or nudge
ozone based on climatological data.
Detailed evaluations of the models used in this study are
