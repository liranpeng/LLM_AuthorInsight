tive transfer problem. So accepting the model limitations and
the inability to match individual measurements, we use the
statistics of observed J values, enhanced or diminished rela-
tive to a clear sky, and ask if the models’ many approxima-
tions for the radiative transfer in cloud ﬁelds can yield those
same net results.
This paper presents the statistical distribution of the mea-
sured J values using the CAFS instrument (Charged-coupled
