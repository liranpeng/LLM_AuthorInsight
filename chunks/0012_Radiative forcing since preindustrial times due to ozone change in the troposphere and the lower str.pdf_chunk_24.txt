schemes, parameterizations of sub-scale processes and mi-
crophysics, and meteorological data. Some of the models
take into account climate change, while others use the same
meteorology for both time slices. Some of the models in-
clude detailed chemistry for both the troposphere and the
stratosphere, while others focus on the troposphere only.
The spatial distribution of radiative forcing is calculated
for the ten sets of model data by three different radia-
