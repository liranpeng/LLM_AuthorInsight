of mass and moisture. The emulator is stable for 100 years, nearly conserves
column moisture without explicit constraints and faithfully reproduces the reference
modelâ€™s climate, outperforming a challenging baseline on over 90% of tracked
variables. ACE requires nearly 100x less wall clock time and is 100x more energy
efficient than the reference model using typically available resources. Without
fine-tuning, ACE can stably generalize to a previously unseen historical sea surface
