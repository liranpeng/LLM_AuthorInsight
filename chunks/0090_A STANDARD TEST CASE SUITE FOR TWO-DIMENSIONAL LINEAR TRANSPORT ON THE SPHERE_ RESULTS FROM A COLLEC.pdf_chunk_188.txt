tions for HOMME-p6 have a much shorter wavelength than
those observed for ICON.
This test, however, was speciﬁcally designed to assess
whether shape-preserving ﬁlters truly eliminate undershoots
and overshoots while still preserving extrema. Finite-volume
scheme based on rigorous ﬂux computations and/or FCT lim-
iters completely eliminate undershoots/overshoots (CSLAM,
ICON, MPAS). For schemes based on simpliﬁed ﬂuxes and
not using FCT limiters, small undershoots are visible (SFF-
