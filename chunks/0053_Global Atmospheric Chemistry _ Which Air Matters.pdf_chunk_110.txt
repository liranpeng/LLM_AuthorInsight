sented in the Supplement Table S5. Modeled data are sam-
pled on the native grid of each model and not interpo-
lated. This approach readily allows us to compare different
models. Both 1-D and 2-D distributions presented here are
sorted into 20 log-spaced bins per each factor of 10 (decade)
in abundance (ppb or ppt). The dashes in the upper/lower
rows of Fig. 5 indicate widths of these bins on each plot.
For example, NOx distributions cover more than 3 decades
