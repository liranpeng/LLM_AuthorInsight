geography. Therefore, for our purposes, we do not consider K > 3 to be physically meaningful.
Our method offers a significant advantage in creating directly comparable clusters of convection between 
different GSRMs. In recent works, clustering compressed representations of clouds from machine learning models 
often employs Agglomerative (hierarchical) Â­clustering64,65. In contrast, our use of the K-means approach allows
