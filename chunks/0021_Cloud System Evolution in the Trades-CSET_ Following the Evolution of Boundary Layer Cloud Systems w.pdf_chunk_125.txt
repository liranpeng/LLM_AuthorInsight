between California and Hawaii on 7 round-trip missions involving low-level flights. These 
observations and subsequent characterizations of cloud and boundary layer evolution along 
the trajectories provide an unprecedented data set for evaluating cloud system evolution in 
several classes of models.
The observing strategy employed allowed for a low-level sampling of clouds over a total 
flight distance of about 20,000 km and another 20,000 km of sampling made in survey mode
