assumption. These column perturbations are not strictly pro-
portional to the OPE across scenarios because the lifetime of
O3 increases towards the poles. Previous CTM studies using
instant dilution found 0.14–0.2 DU enhancements for emis-
sions of 1 Tg(N) yr−1 (Hodnebrog et al., 2011; Hoor et al.,
2009), which encompasses our estimate under instant dilu-
tion.
