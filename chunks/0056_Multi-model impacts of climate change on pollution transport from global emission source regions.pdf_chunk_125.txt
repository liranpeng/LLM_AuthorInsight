vertical transport and dispersion by deep convection. How-
ever, this study examines the impacts of climate change on
transport alone, whilst future air quality will also be greatly
inﬂuenced by climate-driven changes in chemistry and by fu-
ture changes in emissions. Future multi-model comparison
studies would beneﬁt from a larger suite of meteorological
variables that enable a more detailed diagnosis of the large-
scale dynamical responses to climate change. Such improved
