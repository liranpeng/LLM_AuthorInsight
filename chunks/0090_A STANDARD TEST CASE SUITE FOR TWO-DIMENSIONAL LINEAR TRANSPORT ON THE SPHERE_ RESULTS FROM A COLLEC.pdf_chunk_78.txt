Fully two-dimensional semi-Lagrangian
ﬁnite volume
The Conservative Semi-Lagrangian Multi-tracer (CSLAM)
scheme, which has been implemented in NCAR’s High-
Order Methods Modeling Environment (HOMME; Erath
et al., 2012), is based on upstream tracing of cells and subse-
quent integration over overlap areas between the Lagrangian
cell and Eulerian grid cells. Speciﬁcally, the vertices of the
Eulerian grid control volumes/cells are traced upstream and
