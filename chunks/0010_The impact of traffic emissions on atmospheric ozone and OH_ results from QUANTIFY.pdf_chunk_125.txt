in the southern hemisphere summer. The regional effect dur-
ing July can exceed 0.5% in the continental boundary layer
for road trafﬁc. As evident from Fig. 9 ship emissions have a
larger effect even in the zonal mean. The large differences
of both means of transportation on OH can be related to
the different regions and pollution conditions. As will be
seen later, the sensitivity of OH to trafﬁc emissions is largest
in the still relatively pristine regions over the (sub-)tropical
