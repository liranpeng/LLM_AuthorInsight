in the tropics and northern extratropics extending to ∼40◦N
(∼40–50 ppb at the surface and 30–40 ppb in the mid- to
upper troposphere in the Northern Hemisphere; Fig. 3) than
in winter (Fig. 2). In contrast, in the northern middle and
high latitudes, CO-tracer mixing ratios are higher in sum-
mer (up to 50 ppb near the surface; Fig. 3) than in winter
