(2008). The time extrapolation is not used since the wind
Ô¨Åelds are known analytically at any time t. Time integration
is conducted in spectral space with the unlimited scheme.
In physical space, it is conducted with the shape-preserving
scheme.
This scheme does not formally conserve mass and is not
inherently shape-preserving although the interpolation it-
self is very accurate; overshoots and undershoots are much
smaller compared to traditional quasi-cubic interpolation
