machine-learning based parameterizations, which have been
shown to dramatically improve the representation of physical
processes and strongly reduce structural errors compared to
standard schemes1–11. Another source of uncertainty stems
from the inherent stochastic nature of many physical sub-
grid processes in nature, such as turbulence or cloud micro-
physics12–15. Stochastic parameterization schemes have been
proposed to better characterize this latter source of uncer-
