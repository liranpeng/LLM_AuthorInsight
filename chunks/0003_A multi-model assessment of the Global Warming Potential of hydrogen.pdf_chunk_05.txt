evolve in a future growing hydrogen economy. Present-day
hydrogen average abundances (mole fraction) are about 530 ppbv
as reconstructed by ﬁrn air–derived estimates and atmospheric
measurements1,2. Sources of hydrogen include biomass burning,
fossil fuel combustion, biological nitrogen ﬁxation, atmospheric
photo-oxidation of methane and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) in the atmosphere, and possibly geological sources3.
Hydrogen is removed from the atmosphere by biological uptake
