This “residual” rescaling includes a factor σ(a′
ff)
g, the geometric mean of σ(a′
ff) across all variables,
so that the standard deviations of the rescaled variables stay scattered about 1.
Figure 12 shows the “residual” rescaling factors σres(a) of all variables a. The range is about a factor
of 30, with the surface pressure being up-weighted the most relative to the “full field” normalization.
