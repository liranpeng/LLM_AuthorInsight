(i.e., ﬂight segments where NO was measured but NO2 was
not). Thus, the updated NOx gap-ﬁlling MDS-3 was devel-
oped.
The Reactivity Data Stream (RDS) reports the reactivities
listed above plus the net 24 h change in O3 for all 145 388
parcels, land or ocean. (Research ﬂight number 11 of ATom-
4 was a ferry ﬂight from Greenland to Maine without pro-
ﬁling for which many instruments were shut down, and thus
the 1106 parcels have NaN values for the MDS and RDS.)
