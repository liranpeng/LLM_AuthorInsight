ABSTRACT
Machine-learning-based parameterizations (i.e. representation of sub-grid processes) of global climate models or turbulent
simulations have recently been proposed as a powerful alternative to physical, but empirical, representations, offering a lower
computational cost and higher accuracy. Yet, those approaches still suffer from a lack of generalization and extrapolation
