model. Such models learn stochastic differential equations (SDEs
hereafter) through the concept of score matching30,48,49,50,51, with
a forward and a backward process working in tandem. In the
forward process, noise is gradually added to the target data until
the signal becomes indistinguishable from noise. The backward
process then involves denoising the samples using a dedicated
neural network to eliminate the noise. Through this sequential
