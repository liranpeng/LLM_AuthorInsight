the mean but also generates the distribution, producing fine-scale
details stochastically. This approach is akin to the decomposition of
physical variables into their mean and perturbations, common
practice in fluid dynamics, e.g.39.
Through extensive testing in the region of Taiwan, the model is
shown to produce reasonably realistic power spectra and
probability distributions of all target variables. The diffusion
component of CorrDiff is found to be especially important for the
