−2.1 ± 0.7 %/decade (Fig. 1c). Our best estimate for the
N2O lifetime over the past decade (117 years) is still close
to that in P2015, which included other model calculations.
Most important for the N2O budget is the average loss itself,
namely, 13.43 TgN yr−1 with an interannual standard devi-
ation of 3 % and a min-to-max range of 7 %. The primary
