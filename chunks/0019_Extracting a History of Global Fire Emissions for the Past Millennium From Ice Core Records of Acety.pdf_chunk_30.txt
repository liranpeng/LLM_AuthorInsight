contribute signiÔ¨Åcantly to variability in atmospheric acetylene levels.
Acetylene is an ideal proxy for paleobiomass burning because the biomass
burning source is believed to be the only major source of acetylene to the
preindustrial atmosphere (Nicewonger et al., 2020). The ice core records
of acetylene from Greenland and Antarctica are shown in Figure 2.

Ethane is emitted to the modern atmosphere primarily from the produc-
