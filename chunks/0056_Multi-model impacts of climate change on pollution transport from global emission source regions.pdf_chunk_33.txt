sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration distribu-
tions for two 10-year periods: present day (“acchist” simu-
lations) as represented by a period centred on the year 2000
(1996–2005) and a future projection under the latest IPCC
Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) RCP 8.5 sce-
nario for 2090–2099. Note that each modelling group de-
rived their own set of sea surface temperature and sea ice
ﬁelds, typically from a closely related coupled-ocean GCM.
