models in that all are driven by ECMWF operational meteorological
data. The models used either include only tropospheric chemistry
(TM4, p-TOMCAT, UCI) or both stratospheric and tropospheric
chemistry (Oslo CTM-2, MOCAGE). For brevity, we refer the reader
to the detailed model descriptions provided in Hodnebrog et al.
(2011). One major beneﬁt of using a model ensemble is that any
model biases and deﬁciencies are minimized by averaging the
