bution from C2H5OOH), HCHO, CH3CHO (acetaldehyde),
C3H6O (acetone), CO, CH4, C2H6, alkanes (all C3H8 and
higher), alkenes (all C2H4 and higher), aromatics (benzene
+ toluene + xylene), and C5H8 (isoprene + terpenes).
We also add p (hPa), T (K), q (g-H2O kg-airâˆ’1), and lat-
itude and longitude to make up the 23 key variables in each
air parcel. Some collectives like alkanes may be treated as
