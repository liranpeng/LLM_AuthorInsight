Solar-J minus RRTMG-SW, for a typical July tropical atmosphere at four solar zenith angles with Lambertian surface albedo of 0.06 (left
and right sides). The plot is further split into the stratosphere and the troposphere (top and bottom rows). Note that the scale of the x-
axis, K day−1, is 10 times larger for the stratosphere on the top panels.
84◦the two models match closely. While spherical effects
may play some role in this shift, we suspect that Rayleigh
