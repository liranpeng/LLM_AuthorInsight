crease (Fig. 5) tend to be located at higher altitudes and near
the tropopause, where ozone change has a relatively large ef-
fect on radiative forcing.

Radiative forcing due to stratospheric ozone change
3.2.1
The effect of changes in chemistry
Following a decrease in stratospheric ozone more solar ra-
diation can penetrate to the surface/troposphere system giv-
ing a positive SW radiative forcing, while the LW forcing
is negative and especially large for ozone changes near the
