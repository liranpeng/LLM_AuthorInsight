quality simulated by the chemistry–climate models is cen-
tered on the size and duration of AQX episodes and their
interannual variability. This is a bias-free test as shown with
the UCI CTM, and should be able to identify when more bad
years occur in a decade under a future climate, independent
of global changes in baseline levels of pollutants. Our statis-
tics will be used to test the chemistry–climate models used in
the recent IPCC assessment (CMIP5/ACCMIP).
