mesh, one may also trace the Lagrangian parcels through-
out the integration (e.g., Chorin and Marsden, 2000; Cottet
and Koumoutsakos, 2000) similar to the Lagrangian Ô¨Ånite-
volume method described above (TTS-I). This method is re-
ferred to as the Lagrangian particle method, and its imple-
mentation in this intercomparison will be referred to as LPM
(Bosler, 2013). Apart from different remapping to Eulerian
grids, LPM is similar to HEL without diffusion (i.e., HEL-
