(Fig. 8) if there is a strong effort to limit climate change. In-
deed, recent agreement to use the Montreal Protocol (2016)
to phase down production of minor trace gases, the hy-
droï¬‚uorocarbons (HFCs), should cause annually added forc-
ing of Montreal Protocol trace gases (MPTGs) + other trace
gases (OTGs) (red region in Fig. 8) to become near zero or
slightly negative, thus at least partially off-setting growth of
other non-CO2 GHGs, especially N2O.
