ERFs of gases and aerosols will be derived in the 30-year
long ﬁxed SST simulations (see Sect. 3) by investigating
clear-sky and all-sky shortwave and longwave ﬂuxes at the
top of the atmosphere and at the surface. In the same simula-
tions a range of auxiliary variables are requested which char-
acterise emissions, 3-D mass or molar mixing ratios, aerosol
optical properties and cloud properties to complement the
radiative ﬂuxes with actual composition diagnostics. With
