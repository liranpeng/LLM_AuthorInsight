dances in the critical zone are likewise increasing more
quickly. Because of the reduction in photolysis rates, we ex-
pect the abundance to be increasing at about +6 %/decade.
Can we see this in the MLS N2O data? The monthly
mean 30◦S–30◦N N2O abundances are shown in Fig. 1f.
The trends are clear but vary over altitude. At the bot-
tom of the critical zone (32 hPa) the trend is negative,
−3.4 ± 0.5 %/decade, and is probably due to a residual nega-
