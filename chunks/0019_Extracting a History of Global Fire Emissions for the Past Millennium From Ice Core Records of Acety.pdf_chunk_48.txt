3.1. Modeling: Chemistry Transport Model
The UCI‐Chemistry Transport Model (UCI‐CTM) is a 3‐D tropospheric CTM (Holmes et al., 2013; Prather &
Hsu, 2010). It was run with roughly 2.8° horizontal resolution and 57 vertical layers. Transport was driven by
the European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis‐forecast meteorological
ﬁelds, using tropospheric chemistry described by Holmes et al. (2013). Fossil fuel emissions of acetylene
