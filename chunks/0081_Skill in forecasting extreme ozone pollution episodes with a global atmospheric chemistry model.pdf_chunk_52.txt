approach does not inform us about extrapolation error arising
from, e.g., gradients near the coasts. Results for both the US
and EU are similar, and the range of QP is much larger than
in the site-error analysis because we are trying to interpolate
cells that are distant from sites.
With the daily MDA8 O3 values interpolated, we can begin
to analyze the results for each domain. Figure 3 shows a sam-
ple day of grid-cell (1◦× 1◦) average MDA8 O3 values based
