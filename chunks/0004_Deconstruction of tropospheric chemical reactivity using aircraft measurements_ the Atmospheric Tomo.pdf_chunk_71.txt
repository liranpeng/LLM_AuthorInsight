continental pollution in winter. L-CO (Table 1) shows sim-
ilar patterns to L-O3 (lowest in ATom-2 Paciﬁc, highest in
ATom-1 Atlantic), while that of L-CH4 (Table 1) is more
uniform across deployments. This feature can be seen in the
curtain and mean proﬁle plots, where L-CH4 is restricted to
the lower troposphere due to the high temperature sensitivity
of the rate coefﬁcient for Reaction (R1).
The Arctic region is highly seasonal, and photochemistry
