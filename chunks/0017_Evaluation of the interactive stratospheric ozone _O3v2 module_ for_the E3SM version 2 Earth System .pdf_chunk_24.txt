nosed in O3v1. Many of the new chemistry–climate stud-
ies are now including this methodology, i.e., the use of a
stratosphere-only ozone tracer, called StratO3, to calculate
the STE ozone ﬂux (Liu et al., 2020).
The O3v1 module was originally tuned to replicate the
characteristics of the observed Antarctic ozone hole using a
PSC temperature threshold of 193 K in EAMv1. This value
is less than the 195 K threshold in Cariolle et al. (1990) and
