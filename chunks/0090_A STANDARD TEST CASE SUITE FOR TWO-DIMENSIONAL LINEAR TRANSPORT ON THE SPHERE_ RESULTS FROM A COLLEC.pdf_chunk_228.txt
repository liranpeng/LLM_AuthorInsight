norms are the same. This behavior was well described by
Thuburn and Mclntyre (1997): “Shaping two tracer ﬁelds the
same way does not imply shaping them the right way”. In
other words, the mixing diagnostics emphasize a different
aspect of accuracy than normalized error norms (in this case
speciﬁed with 1λm).
Effect of shape-preserving ﬁlter on mixing
For all schemes ℓo is zero or close to zero when the shape-
preserving ﬁlter is applied (as expected). With the excep-
