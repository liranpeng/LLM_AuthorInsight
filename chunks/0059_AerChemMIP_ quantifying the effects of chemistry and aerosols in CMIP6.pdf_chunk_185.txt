using model simulations with ﬁxed SSTs and sea ice; the re-
sponses are characterised by changes in surface temperature
and precipitation (amongst others) using model simulations
with coupled oceans.
AerChemMIP will identify the contributions to the
present-day climate (in terms of ERF) made by aerosol emis-
sions, tropospheric ozone production, stratospheric ozone
depletion, and changes in the reactive gases methane and ni-
trous oxide.
To add to the forcing–response relationships, AerChem-
