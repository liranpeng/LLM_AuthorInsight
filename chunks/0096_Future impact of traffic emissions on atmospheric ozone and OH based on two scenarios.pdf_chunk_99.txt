low emission scenarios (B1 and B1 ACARE) and also for
year 2000.
We ﬁnd that the impacts of the non-land based trafﬁc sec-
tors (AIR and SHIP) on atmospheric O3 will increase sub-
stantially in the future if emissions evolve according to the
A1B scenario. Maximum impacts of O3 due to AIR occur in
the UTLS region and could reach 9 ppbv (monthly and zon-
ally averaged) at high northern latitudes during summer in
2050, while SHIP peaks over the North Atlantic Ocean with
