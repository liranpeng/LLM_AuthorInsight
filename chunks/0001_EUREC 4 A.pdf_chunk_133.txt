of water stable isotopologues (as presented in Sect. 2.3.2).
At the BCO, aboard the R/V Meteor and on the R/V MS-
Merian, advanced Raman lidars provided continuous proﬁl-
ing of water vapor, clouds, temperature, and aerosols. The
nadir-staring WALES lidar on HALO likewise proﬁled wa-
ter vapor, clouds, and aerosols. As an example of this capa-
bility, Fig. 13 presents relative humidity data (deduced from
temperature and absolute humidity retrievals) from the BCO
