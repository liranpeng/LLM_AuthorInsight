reduction. Many NOy species (e.g. HNO3 and N2O5) are
readily removed by dry and wet deposition, and so the
lifetime of NOy is short. Hence, the majority of the NOx
emitted is deposited within the continental-scale source
regions. Between 12 and 24% of emitted NOx is exported
out of the source regions as NOy. Of the four source regions,
EA exports the least NOy, with little seasonality (between
0.10 and 0.15). The most NOy is exported from NA during
