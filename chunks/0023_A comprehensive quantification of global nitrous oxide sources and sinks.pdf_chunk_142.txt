x
= −0.31ln( ) + 1.53 
(R2 = 0.30) and y
x
= −0.454ln( ) + 2.21 (R2 = 0.09). The first logarithmic 
function uses data collected by a review analysis74, and the second is 
based upon this but further considers observations from ref. 21 and 
ref. 75. In the first function, x indicates pasture age in years after defor-
estation, and y (unitless; 0–1) indicates the ratio of pasture N2O emission
