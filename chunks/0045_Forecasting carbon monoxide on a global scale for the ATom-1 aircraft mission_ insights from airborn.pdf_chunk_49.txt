suaq, Greenland. Figure 2 shows the Atlantic ﬂights from
Punta Arenas to Ascension Island to the Azores to Kanger-
lussuaq. GEOS-5 has an excellent simulation of background
CO values seen on these ﬂights, with the mean values falling
within 2 ppb of the observations (Table 2), while the mean
observed values for each ﬂight shift from 69 to 101 to 88 ppb.
The observations show plumes of high CO intersecting the
ﬂight track on all three ﬂights. GEOS-5 also shows plumes
