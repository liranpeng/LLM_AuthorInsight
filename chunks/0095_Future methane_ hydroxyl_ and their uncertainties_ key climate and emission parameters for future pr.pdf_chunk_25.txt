resolution, but the vertical resolution in the boundary layer
is reduced, so there are 57 layers total. Tropospheric chem-
istry of the major gas-phase species involved in HOx, NOx,
O3, and VOC reactions is simulated with the ASAD pack-
age (Carver et al., 1997), with updates to the mechanism and
kinetics (Tang and Prather, 2010). This mechanism includes
84 reactions involving 33 species, making it simpler than the
Oslo CTM3 chemical mechanism. As in Oslo CTM3, clouds
