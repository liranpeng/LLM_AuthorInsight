not worrisome, but the systematic shifts in HOOH and NOx
are a concern. The P2017 experiments showed that, averaged
over an ocean basin, the reactivities with all processes run-
ning for 24 h vs. the ATom protocol were similar. A protocol
that slowly removed HOOH and added NOx is tempting but
would require some arbitrary parameterizations.
