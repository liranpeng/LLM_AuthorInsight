N2O, and hence the N2O lifetime is declining. For N2O, a
major greenhouse gas, it means that the climate impact of its
anthropogenic emissions will be reduced over this century,
and for CFCs, where we expect parallel results, it means that
these now-banned ozone-depleting gases will be cleaned out
of the atmosphere more quickly, as shown by Butchart and
Scaife (2001).
