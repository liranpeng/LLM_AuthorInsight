while mapping testing inputs and outputs with respect to the
distribution of the low-fidelity training data corresponding to
the CAM5 +8K simulation. This latter scenario of a warmer
climate is closer to the high-fidelity extrapolation scenario of
interest. As such, the MF-RPN model is trained on data that
is normalized with a standardization based on the mean and
standard deviation of the low-fidelity data corresponding to
the CAM5 +8K run since the extrapolation to a warmer cli-
