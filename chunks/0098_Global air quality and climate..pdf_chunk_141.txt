One of the more robust conclusions from work over the past
decade is that CH4 controls are a viable strategy for joint
mitigation of climate warming and global O3 pollution (e.g.,
ref. 30, Section 2.1). Abating CH4 should help to oï¬€set some
of warming expected from continued removal of atmospheric
aerosol (sulfate) motivated by improving public health. The
quantitative impact of CH4 oxidation on baseline surface O3 is
uncertain, with the full model range spanning a factor of
