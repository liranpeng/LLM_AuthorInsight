for a complete description of variables used for training. For compatibility with SFNO we regrid
conservatively from the cubed-sphere geometry of FV3GFS to a 1Â° Gaussian grid [21], additionally
filtering the data with a spherical harmonic transform round-trip to remove artifacts in the high
latitudes. We coarsen the vertical coordinate to 8 layers while conserving moisture and energy
(Appendix A).
