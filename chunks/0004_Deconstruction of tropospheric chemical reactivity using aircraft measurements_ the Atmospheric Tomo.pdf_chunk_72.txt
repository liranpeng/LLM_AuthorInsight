mostly shuts down in ATom-2 and ATom-3 (February and
October), but it is quite reactive in ATom-1 and ATom-4 (Au-
gust and May). This is seen clearly in the J values (Table 1),
particularly J-O1D, which is the primary source of OH. The
Arctic reactivities in ATom-1 and ATom-4 are about two-

with the exception of L-CH4, which is extremely repressed
due to the colder Arctic temperatures in all seasons. The ex-
