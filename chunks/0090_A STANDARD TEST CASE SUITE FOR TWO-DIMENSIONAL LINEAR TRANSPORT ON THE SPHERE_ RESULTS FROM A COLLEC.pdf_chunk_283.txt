The Lagrangian particle method relies on the ﬂow map,
x(α,t), giving the trajectory of ﬂuid particles, where α is
a Lagrangian parameter, t time, and x position (Chorin and
Marsden, 2000; Cottet and Koumoutsakos, 2000). The ﬂow
map satisﬁes
D
Dt x(α,t) = u(x(α,t),t),
x(α,0) = α,
(A6)
where u is the given ﬂuid velocity, and the scalar is advected
along particle trajectories,
D
Dt φ(x(α,t),t) = 0.
