rithm to locate an unoccupied cell nearby: (ﬁrst) search E–W
from −8 to +8 longitude-shifted cells; (second) search up–
down in pressure by −2 to +2 levels; and (third) search N–S
from −2 to +2 latitude-shifted cells. With our 1.1◦CTM,
we are always able to ﬁnd an empty cell; however, the lati-
tude, longitude, and pressure of the grid cell may differ from
the ATom-measured value. Figure 3 shows the ATom value
(MDS, x axis) vs. the CTM grid-cell value (RDS, y axis) for
