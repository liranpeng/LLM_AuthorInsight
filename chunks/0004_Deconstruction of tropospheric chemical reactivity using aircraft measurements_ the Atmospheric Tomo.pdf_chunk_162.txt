100+ ppt) not typical of convective high-altitude NOx. These
NOx values were directly measured and are not affected by
the v2b–v3 shift. The anticorrelation with HOOH (Fig. 60) is
surprising: high levels of HOOH surround the separate high-
NOx air mass. Given the overall importance of high-NOx and
(separately) high-HOOH regions to the chemical budgets, it
would be valuable to check the CTM and CCM modeling of
this feature to understand its cause.
