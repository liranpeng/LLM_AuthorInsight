as our reference. This clustering may be due to similar her-
itage: GSFC and GC are derived from a common tropo-
spheric chemistry module; all three models and GISS have
a common heritage for photolysis module. In the compar-
isons below, we will use terms like “bias” to describe differ-
ences with respect to this reference model. Such biases are
not meant to be model errors since we do not know the cor-
rect answer; they are just model–model differences.
