amounts 100 Pg less than in Fig. 10 under assumption that
100 PgC can be stored via improved agricultural and forestry
practices. Shortfall of this 100 PgC goal will increase our es-
timated costs accordingly, as will the cost of the improved
agricultural and forestry program.
Given a CO2 extraction cost of USD 150–350 (tC)−1 for
intensive negative emission technologies (Fig. 3f of Smith
et al., 2016), the 53 PgC additional extraction required for
