at ∼0.8 in agreement with Bi and Yang (2017). When we compared atmospheric heating rates between RRT-
MG and SJ for our January climate simulation (averaged clouds, no overlap model used), the importance of 
ice clouds stands out. Both models can use the same optical properties for liquid clouds (with RRTMG using 
δ-1 scaling), and thus the differences in tropospheric heating rates are systematic but modest (±0.05 K per
