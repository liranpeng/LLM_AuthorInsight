figure 1). Hence, their corresponding uncertainty is naturally
propagated to the corresponding high-fidelity parameteriza-
tion output predictions, ensuring a continuous uncertainty
propagation from the low- to high-fidelity variables.
Machine learning models usually need to be trained on nor-
malized data. In this work, standardization (or Z-score) is used
as normalization so that inputs and outputs have the properties
of a Gaussian distribution with a zero mean and unit variance.
