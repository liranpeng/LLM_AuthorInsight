E3SMv1 with O3v1, undermining the degrees of freedom of
interactive stratospheric chemistry, the tropopause changes
to the quadrupling CO2 peturbation lacks the proper ozone
responses near the tropopause, leading to uncertainties in the
climate sensitivity derived from such a simulation (Golaz et
al., 2019). We are able to quantify this impact by comparing
the climate sensitivity of using O3v1 versus O3v2.
We opt to perform the Cess experiment (Cess et al., 1989)
