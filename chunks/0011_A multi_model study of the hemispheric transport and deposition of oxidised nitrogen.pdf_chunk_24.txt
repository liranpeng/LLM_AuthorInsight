Results and Discussion
[10] A comparison of the multi-model mean wet deposi-
tion fluxes of NOy with measured values are shown in
Figure S1, using the same measurement data as Dentener et
al. [2006]. Summary statistics for this comparison are
presented in Table S3. Briefly, the mean model fluxes
reproduce observed wet deposition fluxes well over NA
and EU, but with more scatter for EA. The models under-
