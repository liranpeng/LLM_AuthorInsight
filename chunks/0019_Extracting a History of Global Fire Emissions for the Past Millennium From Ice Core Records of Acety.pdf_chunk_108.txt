Reconstructing a single ﬁre history from acetylene, ethane, and methane would still be challenging unless
the biofuel sources (1) were heavily distributed toward the higher southern latitudes (>30°S) and (2) were
heavily enriched in acetylene emissions over ethane and methane emissions. Emission factors from multiple
biomass types do not indicate that this is realistic (Akagi et al., 2011; Andreae, 2019; Andreae &
Merlet, 2001).
