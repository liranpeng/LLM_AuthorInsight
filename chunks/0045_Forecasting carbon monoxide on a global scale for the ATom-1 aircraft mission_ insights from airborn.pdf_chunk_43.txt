observations. Tagged tracers indicate that Asian non-BB CO
drove many of the observed enhancements, while others were
due to biomass burning.
In the South Paciﬁc (Pago Pago–Christchurch segment),
the ﬂight sampled the stratosphere three times, with CO lev-
els decreasing to approximately 30 ppb, as shown in Fig. 1c.
As expected from stratospheric chemistry and seen in previ-
ous observations, both ATom-1 and GEOS-5 show a strong
decrease in CO as the ﬂight rises above the tropopause,
