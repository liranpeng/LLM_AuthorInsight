the growth rate of greenhouse gas climate forcing has accelerated markedly in the past decade. The rapidity of
ice sheet and sea level response to global temperature is difﬁcult to predict, but is dependent on the magnitude of
warming. Targets for limiting global warming thus, at minimum, should aim to avoid leaving global temperature
at Eemian or higher levels for centuries. Such targets now require “negative emissions”, i.e., extraction of CO2
