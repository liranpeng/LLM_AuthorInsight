implemented using the offline_dyn option for which the
winds are held ﬁxed throughout the tracer time step, whereas
in HOMME the winds are updated at every Runge–Kutta
step.

Shape-preserving ﬁlters and convergence rates
When examining the histograms for “optimal” convergence
rates for ℓ2 and ℓ∞(Fig. 3 middle and lower, respectively), it
is immediately apparent (with the exception of CLAW, FAR-
SIGHT, SBC), and not surprising, that shape-preserving ﬁl-
