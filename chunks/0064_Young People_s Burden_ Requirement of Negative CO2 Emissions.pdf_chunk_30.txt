simple emission growth rate changes that help evaluate the
plausibility of needed emission changes. We use a Green’s
function calculation of global temperature with canonical cli-
mate sensitivity for each emissions scenario, which yields the
amount of CO2 that must be extracted from the air – effec-
tively the climate debt – to return atmospheric CO2 to less
than 350 ppm or limit global warming to less than 1.5 ◦C
above preindustrial levels. We discuss alternative extraction
