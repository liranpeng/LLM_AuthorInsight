into an array of potential futures driven by assumptions about
energy demand, fossil fuel prices, and climate policy, cho-
sen to be representative of an extensive literature on possible
emissions trajectories (Moss et al., 2010; van Vuuren et al.,
2011; Meinshausen et al., 2011a, b). Numbers on the RCP
scenarios (8.5, 6.0, 4.5 and 2.6) refer to the GHG climate
forcing (W mâˆ’2) in 2100.
Scenario RCP2.6 has the world moving into negative
growth (net contraction) of GHG forcing 25 years from now
