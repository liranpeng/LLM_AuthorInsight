species and 236 chemical reactions that simulate aerosols
in addition to the HOx-NOx-VOC-ozone system. Photol-
ysis rates are calculated with the Fast-JX method, using
aerosol optical depths that are simulated internally, and
ozone columns from the TOMS and SBUV satellites (until
2008) or GEOS-5 assimilation of satellite data (after 2008).
For purposes of stratosphere-troposphere exchange, strato-
spheric ozone is simulated with Linoz.
