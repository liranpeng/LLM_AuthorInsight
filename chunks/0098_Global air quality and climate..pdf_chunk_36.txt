aerosol interactions may augment this positive forcing by
decreasing sulfate burdens.27,44 Projected decreases in these
species under the RCPs17 would thus help to mitigate climate
warming.
In contrast, the impact of biogenic VOC (BVOC) emissions
on climate is highly uncertain. BVOC include a broad suite of
carbon compounds emitted naturally from vegetation, includ-
ing isoprene (C5H8), monoterpenes (C10 compounds), sesqui-
terpenes (C15 compounds), and a large number of oxygenated
