thus scale the surface N2O IAV with the ratio of STE ﬂuxes
(CO2 : N2O) to give an observational estimate of the STE-
driven CO2 IAV in the SH extratropics (dashed blue line
in Fig. 1d). The IAV in SH (40–90◦S) surface CO2 calcu-
lated from the sCO2 model scenario is also shown (dashed
red line in Fig. 1d). The modeled sCO2 and observed N2O-
scaled IAVs are not always in phase, but they are in strong
agreement in terms of amplitude: the STE IAV in CO2 is a
