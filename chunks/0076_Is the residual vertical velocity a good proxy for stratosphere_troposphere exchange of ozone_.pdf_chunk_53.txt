TC-e90 ﬂux (IA-r). Results listed downward in rows are from the TC method (TC-e90, TC-120 ppb, and TC-250
ppb), the LS method (LS-e90, LS-120 ppb, and LS-250 ppb), the simulated hemispheric ﬂuxes across 100 hPa
(wO3NH), and the residual ﬂuxes (w∗O3) across the 100 hPa surface including the net hemispheric values and
the downward only ﬂuxes.
These numbers show how the O3 ﬂux depends on the choice of “tropopause” isosurface (compare three
