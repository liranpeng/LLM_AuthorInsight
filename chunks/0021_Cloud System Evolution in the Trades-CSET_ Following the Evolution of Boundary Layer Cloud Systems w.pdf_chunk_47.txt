spectral irradiances.
Two key remote sensing systems used on the GV during CSET were the HIAPER Cloud 
Radar (HCR) developed by NCAR EOL and the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) 
developed under the NSF HIAPER Aircraft Instrumentation Solicitation (HIAS; ref). These 
remote sensing instruments were used to define macroscopic and microscopic cloud 
properties as the GV flew above, below, and in the clouds. The HCR characteristics are
