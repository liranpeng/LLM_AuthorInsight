Temporal errors structure
Figure 10 shows the temporal variations of testing MAE and R2 for heat tendency and different surrogate models at different
vertical levels. In coherence with the global errors and spatial structures of different error metrics, the MF-RPN is the best
performing model across all testing period and different vertical levels, followed by the LF-RPN model. The errors temporal
