structure of the upper ocean should also help quantify the im-
portance of the O(0.3 K) cool-skin effect and diurnal warm-
ing just below the skin layer (Fairall et al., 1996) on ocean
mixing and air–sea exchange.
Factors, including the role of meso- and sub-mesoscale
variability, inﬂuencing air–sea gas exchange were also stud-
ied. pCO2 measurements were made on the R/V Atalante,
R/V MS-Merian, and the R/V Ron Brown (Fig. 18). In ad-
dition, both the R/V MS-Merian and R/V Meteor regularly
