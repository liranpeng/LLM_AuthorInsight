correlation is similar if we only count the downward O3 ﬂux north of 40◦latitude but is much poorer if the
downward only ﬂux of air (w∗>0) is used as a proxy for the STE ﬂux. These correlations also do not improve
if one allows for a time lag.
It is surprising that the two diﬀerent versions of the IFS forecast system do not show more correlation
for most of the calculated ﬂuxes given that both are forecasting the same assimilated ﬁelds. The cross
