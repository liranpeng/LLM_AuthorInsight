Figure 5. The contribution of each tagged CO tracer over the Paciﬁc in the (a) upper and middle troposphere (pressure < = 850 hPa) and (b)
lower troposphere (pressure > 850 hPa). Data from multiple ﬂights over the region between 120◦E and 110◦W are included, with each bar
representing data averaged over a 5◦latitude bin. Shaded bars represent non-BB CO from Asia (orange), N. America (purple), Europe (red),
