Aerosol–cloud interaction and total aerosol effect
A subset of ﬁve models were able to diagnose the forc-
ing from aerosol–cloud interaction, with four models hav-
ing a weak or slightly positive forcing and one model having
a large positive forcing; see Fig. 6a. In three of the mod-
els, rapid adjustments associated with aerosol–cloud inter-
actions are simulated (i.e. in IPCC AR5 terms, they simu-
late an effective radiative forcing, or ERF), whereas in the
