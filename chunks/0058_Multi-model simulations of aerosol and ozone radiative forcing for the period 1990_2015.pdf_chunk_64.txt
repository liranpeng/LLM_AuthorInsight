(USA and Europe), the models generally reproduce observed
large-scale surface trends in both compounds. Our key ﬁnd-
ing based on the updated model simulations is that there is
stronger positive radiative forcing of aerosols and ozone over
the past 25 years than reported in IPCC AR5. The global

the period 1990 to 2015 is almost +0.2 W m−2. However,
