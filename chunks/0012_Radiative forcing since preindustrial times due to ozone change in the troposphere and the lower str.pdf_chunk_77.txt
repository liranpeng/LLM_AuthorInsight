With respect to stratospheric change since 1850, the mod-
els can be divided into four groups related to the different
model set-ups described in the previous section.

with detailed stratospheric chemistry (ULAQ, DLR E39C,
NCAR MACCM, and UIO CTM2) let the stratosphere re-
spond freely to changing ozone precursors and ozone de-
pleting substances.
