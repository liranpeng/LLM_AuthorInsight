has near-exact, but costly solutions; whereas the atmospheric physics of the problem involving gases, clouds, 
aerosols and surface properties includes unknowns that cause a fundamental uncertainty in the solution. One 
motivation for this study is to evaluate the potential improvements in solar heating rates if more accurate 
physics or RT codes are used, but the overriding motivation is to assess a wide range of approximations and un-
