with the QCLS observations overplotted in circles. The ob-
servations show higher values of CO in the ﬁrst half of the
Anchorage–Kona ﬂight compared to the other portions of the
Paciﬁc, and this feature is reproduced in GEOS-5 as well.
GEOS-5 agrees well with the observed mean value for CO
on this ﬂight (Table 2). Tagged tracers (Fig. 1 bottom pan-
els) show that non-BB sources, especially from Asia, are the
dominant contributor to CO levels throughout the Paciﬁc,
