try to model the speciﬁc period of the ATom deployments.
Others may use the ATom data with hindcast CTMs to test
forecast models, but here we want to build a chemical clima-
tology.
The ﬁrst hard test of the A runs came with the second
ATom modeling paper (“How well can global chemistry
models calculate the reactivity of short-lived greenhouse
gases in the remote troposphere, knowing the chemical com-
position”, Prather et al., 2018, hence P2018). The UCI CTM
