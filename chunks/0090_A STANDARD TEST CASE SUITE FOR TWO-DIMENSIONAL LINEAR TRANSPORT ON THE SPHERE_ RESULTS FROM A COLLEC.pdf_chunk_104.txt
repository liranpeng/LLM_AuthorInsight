(Ritchie et al., 1995). A simple global mass ﬁx scheme based
on a variational formulation by Sun and Sun (2004) is used.
Shape preservation is enforced by a quasi-monotone scheme
by Nair et al. (1999). The quasi-monotone scheme is an im-
proved version of Sun et al. (1996) that applies the Bermejo
and Staniforth (1992) ﬁlter.
