0.65 W m2. Myhre77 report a best estimate for aerosol
direct RF of 0.3 W m2 after reconciling divergent estimates
from modeling and observational approaches by accounting
for diï¬€erences in cloud-masked forcing and changes over the
last century in bulk aerosol optical properties. Sulfate, nitrate
and OC aerosol scatter radiation with direct aerosol RFs
estimated as 0.4 W m2, 0.1 W m2 and 0.05 W m2
respectively.10 BC absorbs solar and infrared radiation resulting
