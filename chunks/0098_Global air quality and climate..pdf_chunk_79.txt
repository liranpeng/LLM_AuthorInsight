are highly uncertain.
Because terrestrial biogenic emissions are climatically driven,
multiple feedbacks can occur between climate, the emis-
sions, and therefore air quality. For example, biogenic VOC
emissions are dependent on radiation, temperature and soil
moisture.48 Atmosphere–biosphere feedbacks through bio-
genic aerosols have been proposed in the literature,183–185
but these are largely estimated by models as it is diﬃcult to
