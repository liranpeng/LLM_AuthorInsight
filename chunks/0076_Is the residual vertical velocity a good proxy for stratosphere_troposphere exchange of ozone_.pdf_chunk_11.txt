100 hPa or 380 K to separate it from the middle world). The LS method is ﬁrst devised by Appenzeller et al.
[1996] to derive STE ﬂuxes of air mass. (3) Our Brewer-Dobson method (BD method hereafter [Holton, 1990])
calculates the monthly mean vertical residual velocity (w
∗) from the transformed Eulerian mean equations
[Andrews et al., 1987] and combines with the coincident average ozone (O3) to calculate a ﬂux (w∗O3). The
