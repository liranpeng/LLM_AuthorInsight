ness. Similarly, clouds inﬂuence the downward longwave and
shortwave irradiance, which inﬂuences both the sea surface
temperature and atmospheric temperatures directly, some-
thing that Naumann et al. (2019) have shown to commen-
surately power (2 to 200 km) circulations.
In the area near and within the EUREC4A-Circle (Region
A), measurements sought to quantify how surface exchange
processes vary with circulation (cloud pattern) regime. Mea-
