needs to be determined as we have differing resolution across
CCMs and the climatology is a useful model diagnostic only
if it is robust across different model resolutions. We create
a 2◦× 2◦data set (typical of CCM resolution) using simple
means of the MDA8 concentrations from the 1◦× 1◦obser-
vational data set. AQX events and episodes are deﬁned as
