with a 6-hole symphyseal plate, an additional 4-hole-anterior-plate and
reinforcement with TOCF was necessary. The reason for TOCF was
anticipated implant loosening due to the heavy load. The surgical
procedure itself was without complications but the patient developed a
surgical site infection with a multisensitive staphylococcus epidermidis.
Another four surgical wound washouts were necessary, further
complicated by a prolonged ICU stay due to respiratory problems.
