from 600 typhoon-containing time intervals in the years 1980â€“2020
period. This extended analysis suggests that, while the main results
emphasized for are case study above are qualitatively representative
when typhoons are far from land, the diffusion component of
CorrDiff frequently plays a stronger role in intensifying typhoon
axisymmetric structure, and CorrDiff tends to lead to too much
horizontal contraction of cyclone morphology, predicting a radius
