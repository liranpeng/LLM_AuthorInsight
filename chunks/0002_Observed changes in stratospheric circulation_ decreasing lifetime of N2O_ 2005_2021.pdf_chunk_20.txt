sigma) range, because we are looking for “likely” connec-
tions (68 % conﬁdence) rather than “extremely likely” ones
(95 %). For example, the linear regression trend in N2O loss
uses the running averages and has 198 monthly points. The
uncertainty is scaled up assuming there are only 17 yearly
data points. As a check we recalculate the regression ﬁt with
the unsmoothed monthly data and get the same uncertainty.
