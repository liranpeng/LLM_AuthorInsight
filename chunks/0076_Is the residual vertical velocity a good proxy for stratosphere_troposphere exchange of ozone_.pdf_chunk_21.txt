during the spring. In terms of the hemispherically integrated STE ﬂuxes, similar values are obtained across
all chosen isosurfaces with the TC and LS methods. In terms of seasonality, the Northern Hemisphere (NH)
(not Southern Hemisphere (SH)) residual ﬂuxes from the BD method do capture the phase of the seasonal
cycle but with a magnitude that is about twice as large. Section 3.2 examines interannual variability. For
