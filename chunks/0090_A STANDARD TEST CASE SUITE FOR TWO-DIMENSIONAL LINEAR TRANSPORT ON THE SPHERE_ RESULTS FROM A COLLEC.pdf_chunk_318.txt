(Figs. 1–2) is actually the convergence with time step, as the
errors at differing spatial resolution runs at the same time step
(i.e., differing CN) are similar.
UCISOM can be run with a range of shape-preserving
options (limiters L), and these range from no action (L =
0, allows for transport of negative tracer in some circum-
stances), positive deﬁnite (L = 1, tracer moments adjusted
before transport to ensure no negative tracer anywhere within
