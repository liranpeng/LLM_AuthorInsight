Earth System Model (CESM) that augment the CESM capability to
explore the uncertainty in future stratospheric-tropospheric ozone,
stratospheric circulation, and thus the lifetimes of chemically
controlled greenhouse gases from climate simulations. To this end,
we have successfully implemented Fast-J (radiation algorithm
determining key chemical photolysis rates) and Linoz v3.0
(linearized photochemistry for interactive O3, N2O, NOy and CH4)
