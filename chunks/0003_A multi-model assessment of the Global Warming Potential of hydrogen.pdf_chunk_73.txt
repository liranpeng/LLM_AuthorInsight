centrations of methane per methane ﬂux (ppb (CH4) (Tg(CH4) yr−1)−1) in
PERT_CH4 with the calculated methane ﬂux in PERT_H2. The methane radiative
forcing is calculated by the increase in surface concentration converted using a
concentration-to-forcing factor of 0.448 mW m−2 ppb−1,44 and adjustment term of
−14%33 to calculate Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF). While Supplementary
