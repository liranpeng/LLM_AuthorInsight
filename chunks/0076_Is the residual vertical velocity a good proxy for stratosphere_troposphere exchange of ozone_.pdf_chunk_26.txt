horizontal resolution and ∼1 km vertical resolution in the lower stratosphere; IFS Cycle 29r1 (C29 here-
after) data for years 2000–2006 and IFS Cycle 36r1 (C36 hereafter) for years 2000–2007. Each simulation
is ﬁrst spun up for 10 years by recycling year 2000 meteorology. Changes in parameterization and assim-
ilation processes made for each cycle of ECMWF-IFS can be found at http://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/
