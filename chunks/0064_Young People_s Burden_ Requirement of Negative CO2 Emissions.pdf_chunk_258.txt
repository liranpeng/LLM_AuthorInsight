it is difﬁcult to attribute the magnitude of the rise to tropical

CO2 emissions in historical period
For land use CO2 emissions in the historical period, we use
the values labeled Houghton/2 by Hansen et al. (2008), which
were shown in the latter publication to yield good agreement
with observed CO2. We use fossil fuel CO2 emissions data
for 1850–2013 from Boden et al. (2016). BP (2016) fuel con-
