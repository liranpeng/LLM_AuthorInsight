CO2, they emit 17 % of anthropogenic NOx and 10 % of an-
thropogenic SO2 due to high engine temperatures and efÔ¨Å-
ciencies, use of high-sulfur fuel, and general lack of emis-
sion controls (Lamarque et al., 2010). CO2 unambiguously
warms the climate and sulfate aerosol derived from SO2 un-
ambiguously cools it; the net forcing from NOx, however,
involves both warming and cooling components. NOx emis-
sions, whether from ships or other sources, favor ozone pro-
