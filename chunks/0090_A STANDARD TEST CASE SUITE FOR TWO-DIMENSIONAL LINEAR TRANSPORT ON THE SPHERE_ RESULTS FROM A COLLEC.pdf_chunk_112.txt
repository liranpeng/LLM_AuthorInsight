Results
In this section the results for the transport schemes that par-
ticipated in this comparison are presented and discussed.
Horizontal resolutions are speciﬁed in terms of average grid
spacing at the Equator. The test case suite works with three
resolutions 1λ : 1.5◦, 0.75◦, and 1λm (the latter is scheme
dependent and deﬁned in Sect. 3.2), where λ denotes the lon-
