models. If possible AOT should be output for sulfate, organic
matter, dust, sea salt, black carbon, and nitrate at ambient rel-
ative humidity. In the case of internal mixed aerosol modes,
total AOT shall be distributed according to the volume of the
dry aerosol species present in the mixed aerosol mode. The
sum of speciated AOT from all species simulated should be
equal to total AOT at any given point in time and space.
