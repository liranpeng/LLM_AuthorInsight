As in RAN, ICAs #1 and #3 are tagged as cloudy in layer L1,
ICAs #2 and #4 are tagged as clear in layer L1, and the sum
of cloudy fractions is conserved (9 % + 6 % = 15 % = f L1 )
but with different weightings. The COR model also has ICAs
scaling as 2NL.

Maximal overlap
For maximal overlap of clouds (MAX) as in Fig. 1, the two
layers L1 and L2 form a MAX group G1 consisting of one
clear-sky column (80 % fractional coverage) and 2 cloudy
