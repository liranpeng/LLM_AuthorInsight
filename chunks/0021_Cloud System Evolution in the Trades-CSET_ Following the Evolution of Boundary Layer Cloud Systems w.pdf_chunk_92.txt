the North East Pacific, although sea surface temperatures were above normal. On average 
the center of the subtropical anticyclone was at about 43 N and 148 E during the observing 
period (Fig. 5), which is slightly north of the climatological position. Some variations in the 
strength and location of the anticyclone were observed during the 4 weeks of observations. 
The sea surface temperatures (Fig. 5) in the study area were about 0.5 Â°C above 1981-2010
