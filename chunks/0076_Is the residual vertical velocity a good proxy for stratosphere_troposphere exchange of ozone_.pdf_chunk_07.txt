in these studies, the net stratospheric inï¬‚ux is a small residual with a large uncertainty range as a result of
balancing the three large terms that are inconsistently calculated among climate-chemistry models (CCMs;
see Table 2 in Young et al. [2013]). The inferred STE calculated from the tropospheric ozone photochemistry
budget is also found to be sensitive to the choice for the upper boundary of the troposphere (see Table 2
