of the climatological biomass burning emissions provided in
the RCP inventory because ﬁres are a major cause of year-
to-year variability in tropospheric OH (Duncan et al., 2003;
Manning et al., 2005; Dalsoren et al., 2006). Biogenic emis-
sions of isoprene, CO, and other VOCs are from a MEGAN
climatology for the 2000s decade (Guenther et al., 2006).
Anthropogenic, biogenic, and biomass burning emission data
