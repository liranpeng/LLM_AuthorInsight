schemes. Even contour plotting of solutions varies across
publications despite the speciﬁc guidelines of Williamson
et al. (1992). Said colloquially, “apples-to-apples” compari-
son is not always straightforward despite the simplicity of the
test (i.e., an analytical solution is known). This, among other
things, motivated Lauritzen et al. (2012, hereafter referred
to as LSPT2012) to propose a standard test case suite with
speciﬁc guidelines for resolution and other transport model
