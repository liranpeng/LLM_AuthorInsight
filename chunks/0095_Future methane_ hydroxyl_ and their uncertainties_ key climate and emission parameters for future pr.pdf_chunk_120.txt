C. D. Holmes et al.: Future methane, hydroxyl, and their uncertainties
to 1980 levels around 2045 due to the decrease of long-
lived halogenated gases (Newman et al., 2007; Austin and
Scinocca, 2010; Eyring et al., 2010a), followed by GHG-
driven ozone decreases through 2100 (Eyring et al., 2010a).
We adopt this projection, adding uncertainty that grows to
3 % of the total column in 2100. Lightning NOx emissions
