frequency is based on NOAA's tropospheric burden rescaled to 320 ppb. (b) Modeled loss (%/yr) of N2OX (solid lines; 
left y-axis) and F11X (dashed lines; right y-axis). Results are shown for GMI (green, blue) and UCI (red, gold). Note: 
F11X loss y-axis scale is twice that of N2OX loss. GMI, Global Modeling Initiative; LMDz, Laboratoire de Météorologie
