hole (Ruiz et al., 2021; Ruiz and Prather, 2022; Tang et al.,
2021). For CO2, I develop two model scenarios to high-
light the impacts of atmospheric transport. First, I deﬁne a
surface-emissions-driven eCO2 scenario, in which the total
atmosphere increases at a constant rate of 2 ppm yr−1 (parts
per million, dry-air mole fraction), driving a ﬂux of about
2 PgCyr−1 into the SH. This eCO2 scenario is a simple ex-
periment with area-uniform (20–60◦N) and time-constant
