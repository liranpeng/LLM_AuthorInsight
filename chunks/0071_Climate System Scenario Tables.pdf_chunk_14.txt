Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) projects, are used to project future 
composition and ERF separately from the RCP model (see Sections 
6.4.3, 11.3.5 and 12.3). Thus, projected changes in greenhouse gases 
(GHGs), aerosols and ERF evaluated in this report may differ from the 
published RCPs and from what was used in the CMIP5 runs, and these 
are denoted RCP&. The CMIP5 climate projections used for the most 
part the RCP concentration pathways for well-mixed greenhouse gases
