start time of the integration, and thus models do not have to
synchronize with the local time of observation (see P2018â€™s
Fig. S8 and Table S8).
The initial ATom-1 reactivities came from MDS-0 and six
of the models in Table 1. Although these RDS-0 model re-
sults are now out of date because of the move to MDS-
2b, they provide critical information on how models agree,
or disagree, in calculating the RDS using the ATom proto-
col. Thus we include them here as a cross-model compari-
