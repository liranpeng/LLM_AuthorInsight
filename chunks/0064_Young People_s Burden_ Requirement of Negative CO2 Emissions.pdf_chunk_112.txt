with CO2 capture and storage. Already in 2015 there is
a huge gap between reality and RCP2.6. Closing the gap
(0.01 W m−2) between actual growth of GHG climate forcing
in 2015 and RCP2.6 (Fig. 8b), with CO2 alone, would require
extraction from the atmosphere of more than 0.7 ppm of CO2
or 1.5 PgC due to the emissions gap of a single year (2015).
We discuss the plausibility and estimated costs of scenarios
with CO2 extraction in Sect. 9.
As a complement to RCP scenarios, we deﬁne scenar-
