Figure 4. Histograms of probability densities (PDs) of NOx (0–12 km, a), NOx (0–4 km, b), HOOH (0–12 km, c), and HCHO (0–12 km, d)
for the three tropical regions (central Paciﬁc, eastern Paciﬁc, and Atlantic). The ATom-1 data are plotted on top of the six global chemistry
models’ results for a day in mid-August and sampled as described in Fig. 3.
