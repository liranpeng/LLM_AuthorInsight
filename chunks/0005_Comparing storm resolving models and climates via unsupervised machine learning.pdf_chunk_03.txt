study provides a path toward evaluating future high-resolution simulation data more objectively.
The Earth’s atmosphere is a complex system, with many different factors influencing its dynamics on scales rang-
ing from microns to thousands of kilometers. Thanks to modern high-resolution global Earth system models, 
much of this complexity can now be captured with unprecedented accuracy, down to the “storm-resolving”
