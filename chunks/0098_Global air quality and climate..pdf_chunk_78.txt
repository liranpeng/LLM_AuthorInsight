on the ecosystem type and the magnitude of aerosol loading.176–178
It is feasible that anthropogenic aerosol may have further
substantial eﬀects on the CO2 land sink, by altering the surface
energy budget179–181 and the amount of precipitation, thereby
inﬂuencing water stress in vegetation.182 Atmospheric deposi-
tion of sulfate, nitrate and carbonaceous aerosol to surface
ecosystems may impact the carbon cycle but these feedbacks
are highly uncertain.
