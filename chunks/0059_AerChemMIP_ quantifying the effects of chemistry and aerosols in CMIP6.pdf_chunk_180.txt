spheric chemistry in AerChemMIP Ô¨Åxes halocarbon concen-
trations at 1950s levels allowing the model chemistry to gen-
erate the difference in ozone compared to historical. DAMIP
will use SSP2-4.5 as its future scenario, with ssp245-ghg
and ssp245aer as variants, so this does not overlap with the
AerChemMIP future experiments.

The future scenario SSP3-7.0 (experiment ssp370) is pre-
scribed as a Tier 1 scenario in ScenarioMIP with extra en-
