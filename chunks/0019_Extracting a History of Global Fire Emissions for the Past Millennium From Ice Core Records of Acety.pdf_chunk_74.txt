and ethane were limited to two possible conditions: (1) 0 or (2) the high end of the range permitted by radio-
carbon measurements of ice core methane (Dyonisius et al., 2020; Hmiel et al., 2020; Petrenko et al., 2017).
For acetylene, we assumed a maximum geologic emission of 0.5 Tg yearâˆ’1 during the preindustrial based on
