Qualitative model intercomparison
Inspecting the dimensionality-reduced data along with the learned latent clustering and spatial visualization 
(Fig. 4) gives unique qualitative insights into commonalities and differences across GSRMs. While most GSRMs 
share similar distributions in the latent space, Fig. 3 reveals that the SPCAM and SAM models show systematic
