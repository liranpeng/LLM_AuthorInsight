N . The average grid spacing at the Equator 1λ is calculated
as
1λ = 2π
5N .
We presented results of all the test cases for ﬁxed maxi-
mum Courant number (CN = 0.8). Table A3 lists the icosa-
hedral resolution N, average grid spacing at the Equator 1λ
and time step of the simulation 1t.
The wind vector used to approximate the ﬂux area is com-
puted by evaluating the analytical wind ﬁeld at the midpoint
of the cell side at time t = n × 1t. For shape preservation,
