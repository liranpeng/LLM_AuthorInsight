Figure S1 in the Supplement shows the regions included in
each tagged tracer. Bian et al. (2013) used observations of
dichloromethane and acetonitrile from the ARCTAS mission
to validate the anthropogenic and biomass burning CO trac-
ers, respectively.
Daily-varying biomass burning emissions come from the
Quick Fire Emission Dataset (QFED) version 2 (Darmenov
and da Silva, 2015), which is based on Ô¨Åre radiative power
from the MODIS instrument. Thus the BB emissions in-
