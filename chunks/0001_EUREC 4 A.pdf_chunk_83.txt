longwave and shortwave radiometers were installed on three
of the airborne (zenith and nadir) and surface (zenith) plat-
forms. In addition, HALO and the R/V Meteor hosted high-
spectral-resolution systems measuring shortwave and near-
infrared down- and upwelling radiances (Wendisch et al.,
2001). Near-real-time geostationary GOES-East satellite im-
agery and cloud product retrievals between 19◦N–5◦S and
49–66◦W were collected, with ﬁner temporal resolution ev-
