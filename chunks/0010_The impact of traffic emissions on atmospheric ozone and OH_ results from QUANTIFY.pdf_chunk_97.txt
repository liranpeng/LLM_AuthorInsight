tions since in those studies the applied resolutions coarser
than 3.75◦×3.75◦(Schumann, 1998) or T21 (Gauss et al.,
2006). The model with the lowest resolution (p-TOMCAT)
in our study also calculates the strongest average perturba-
tions which are in the range of 150–232.5 pptv (or 1.6–4.2%
when scaling to 100%) with maxima during summer exceed-
ing 300 pptv. The coarse resolution leads to an instantaneous
spread of the emissions over large areas and volumes which
