can also be seen over urban regions in Europe, the US and
South Asia which are expected to experience high increases
in population by 2050. The strong impact of ROAD over Ara-
bia is due to a combination of large emissions of O3 precur-
sors, inefﬁcient O3 dry deposition, and efﬁcient photo dis-
sociation, whereas the latter is caused by low zenith angles,
absence of clouds, and high surface albedo which all yield
high actinic ﬂuxes of solar radiation.
