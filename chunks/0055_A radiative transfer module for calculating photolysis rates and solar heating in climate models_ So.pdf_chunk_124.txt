different scales at different SZAs.
A key cirrus CRE is the increase in albedo, the top-of-
atmosphere reﬂected sunlight, as shown for all models and
a range of SZAs in Fig. 6 (top row). The percent increase
across RRTMG-SW models (13–131 %) scales in proportion
to τ, with EC92 being the largest and Key02, the smallest.
This relative order stays the same across all SZAs, but the
range across RRTMG-SW models decreases and the relative
percent increases for larger SZAs. The Solar-J model also
