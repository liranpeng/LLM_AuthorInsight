N2O emissions after transport of anthropogenic nitrogen additions 
via the atmosphere and via water bodies increased from 1.1 (0.6–1.9) Tg 
N yr−1 in the 1980s to 1.3 (0.7–2.2) Tg N yr−1 during 2007–2016 (Table 1). 
The N2O emissions from inland and coastal waters increased at a rate 
of 0.03 ± 0.00 Tg N yr−1 per decade (P < 0.05). Such an increase was 
reported by all three inventories (FAOSTAT, GAINS and EDGAR v4.3.2)
