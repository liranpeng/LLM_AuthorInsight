free troposphere in both summer hemispheres with a pro-
nounced seasonal cycle in the northern extratropics.
The
maximum effect on ozone occurs in July, when convection
at these latitudes is strongest. Thus during that time of the
year pollutants from road trafÔ¨Åc have a much higher proba-
bility to be transported to tropopause altitudes compared to
winter. This is also evident from Fig. 6 where the ozone per-
turbations in July below the tropopause are almost equal to
the effect from aircraft.
