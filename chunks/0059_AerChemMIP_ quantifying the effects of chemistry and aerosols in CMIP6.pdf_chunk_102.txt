lowing the SSP3-7.0 and SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF scenarios for
WMGHG and NTCF emissions (experiments ssp370 and
ssp370-lowNTCF; see Fig. 1 and Table 4). Note that the
ssp370 reference simulation is the same as in ScenarioMIP;
it is therefore required that ScenarioMIP ssp370 is performed
using the same model conﬁguration as for AerChemMIP. The
climate and air quality signals will be derived by subtract-
ing the experiment (“clean”; see Tables 4 and 5) from the
