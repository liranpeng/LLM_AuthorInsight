the Atlantic, but in both central and eastern Paciﬁc, the mod-
eled low end (< 40 ppt) is simply not seen in the ATom data.
Also, the models are missing a strong HCHO peak at 300 ppt
in the eastern Paciﬁc, probably convection-related. Thus, in
terms of these HOx precursors, the model climatologies ap-
pear to be at least as reactive as the ATom data.
While the ATom-1 data in Fig. 4 are limited to single tran-
sects, the model NOx discrepancies apply across the three
