in an appropriate grid cell of each model, turns off processes
that mix adjacent grid cells, and integrates the 3-D model for
24 h (see P2017). The photochemical module is thus depen-
dent only on the chemical mechanism and the diurnal cycle
of photolysis rates, which are driven in turn by temperature,
water vapor, solar zenith angle, clouds, possibly aerosols and
overhead ozone, which are calculated as they would be in
each model.
Typical 3-D multi-model evaluations cannot separate dif-
