regional precipitation patterns and consideration of this addi-
tional climate response may oﬀset some of the adverse eﬀects
of the temperature rise induced by removing anthropogenic
aerosol.
Secondary organic aerosol (SOA). SOA arises from both
biogenic and anthropogenic sources, and continuously evolves
in the atmosphere as a function of multi-generational oxida-
tion and dynamic gas-particle partitioning. Biogenic VOC
oxidation can lead to the formation of SOA through a suite
