seen in the 12-month running mean. The SMO IAV is calcu-
lated in the same way and plotted alongside the SPO+CGO
IAV in Fig. 1d. The IAVs for N2O observations as well as the
modeled eCO2 and sCO2 scenarios use the same processing.
For monthly N2O surface observations, also from NOAA
ESRL (Dlugokencky et al., 2021a), I focus on SH extratrop-
