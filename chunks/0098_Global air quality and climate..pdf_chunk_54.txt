ﬁnds that fossil and biofuel sources alone result in a warming
of between 0.03 and 0.11 K through this eﬀect.
The overall eﬀect of anthropogenic aerosol is likely to be a
cooling impact on climate. The IPCC AR4 estimated a total
forcing of 1.2 W m2 from anthropogenic aerosol, partly
oﬀsetting the warming of 2.6 W m2 from long-lived green-
house gases.10 These estimates do not include aerosol-induced
changes to biogeochemical cycles, which were recently esti-
