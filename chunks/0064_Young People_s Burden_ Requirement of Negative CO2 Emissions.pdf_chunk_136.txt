in the 22nd century, which meant that large CO2 extraction
continued in cases with continuing high emissions; for exam-
ple, the case with constant emissions that required extraction
of 695 PgC during 2020–2100 required further extraction of
∼900 PgC during 2100–2200. Even the cases with annual
emission reductions −6 and −3 % yr−1 required small ex-
tractions to compensate for back-ﬂux of CO2 from the ocean
that accumulated there historically.
A stark summary of alternative futures emerges from
