1-D radiative transfer over a range of ICAs, may be more
consistent. At these scales, the problem of a strong zenith
angle dependence remains (Tompkins and Giuseppe, 2007).
Super-high-resolution models (âˆ¼1 km) are becoming avail-
able in regional or nested-grid models (Kendon et al., 2012;
Schwartz, 2014; Berthou et al., 2018), and one might hope
that our problem is now solved because each single-column
atmosphere (SCA) explicitly resolves cloud overlap, with
