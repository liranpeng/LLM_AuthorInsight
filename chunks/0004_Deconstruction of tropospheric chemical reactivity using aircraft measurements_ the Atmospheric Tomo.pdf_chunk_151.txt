(∼2 %) this might be true for L-CH4, but this is not appar-
ent with the precision shown given that L-CH4 is 2–3 times
smaller than L-CO.
For the Atlantic basins (53◦S–60◦N), all four ATom de-
ployments are shown in each panel. Only the ﬁrst day of
each deployment is shown (and hence these are not identi-
cal to Figs. 40–43). Values in the legend are the basin-wide
averages for each deployment, given as v2b (dashed lines)
and then v3 (solid lines). See Fig. 40.
