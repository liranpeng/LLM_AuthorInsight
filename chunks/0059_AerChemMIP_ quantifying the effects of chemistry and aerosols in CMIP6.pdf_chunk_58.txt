pacts associated with speciﬁc biogeochemical cycles. To do
this it will be necessary to quantify the climate response
to the heterogeneous forcing patterns from naturally emit-
ted short-lived species (the climate responses to WMGHGs
are already covered in Sect. 2.1). Six different feedbacks will
be examined: (1) dust emissions, (2) sea-salt emissions, (3)
DMS emissions, (4) ﬁre emissions, (5) NOx emissions from
lightning, and (6) biogenic VOC emissions. Each will have a
