conversion from natural vegetation to croplands or pastures, DLEM 
uses a similar strategy to that used in ref. 72 and ref. 77 to simulate its 
influences on carbon and nitrogen cycles. Moreover, through using 
the sites of field observation from ref. 20 and ref. 75, we estimated N2O 
emission from secondary tropical forests based on the algorithm: 
y = 0.0084x + 0.2401 (R2 = 0.44). x indicates secondary forest age and 
y indicates the ratio of secondary forest N2O emission over that of a
