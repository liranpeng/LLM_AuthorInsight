cur predominantly in clustered, multiday episodes with spa-
tial extents of more than 1000 km. Such scales are amenable
to forecasting with current global atmospheric chemistry
models. We develop an objective mapping algorithm that
uses the heterogeneous observations of the individual sur-
face sites to calculate surface ozone averaged over 1◦by
1◦grid cells, matching the resolution of a global model.
