estimates from CMIP models. As the climate warms, significant reductions in low cloud cover occur over stratocumulus regions. This study is the first attempt to compare HR‐MMF results with predictions from idealized large‐eddy simulations from the CGILS intercomparison. Despite different underlying assumptions, we find qualitative agreement in SWCRE and inversion height changes between HR‐MMF and CGILS predictions. This suggests reasonable credibility for the CGILS framework in predicting cloud
