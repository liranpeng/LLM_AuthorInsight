target data as well as with several baseline models. A common set
of 205 randomly selected out-of-sample date and time combinations
from 2021 is used for computing metrics and spectra and for
intercomparing CorrDiff with the baseline models. For CorrDiff
ensemble predictions are examined using a 32-member ensemble;
larger ensembles do not meaningfully modify the key findings
below (not shown).
Baseline models
As baselines, we use an interpolation of the condition data (ERA5),
