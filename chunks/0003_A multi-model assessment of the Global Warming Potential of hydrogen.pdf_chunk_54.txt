and 11) close to the model mean of 11.6 ± 2.8 with the models’
own soil sinks.
Our results are derived by perturbing the surface concentration
of hydrogen. To assess the sensitivity of our results to this setup,
we also perform emission perturbations using the GFDL and
OsloCTM models. In GFDL-emi, GFDL has been perturbed with
200 Tg yr−1 anthropogenic hydrogen emissions, fully coupled for
50 years (as described in17). We have also run OsloCTM with
