Accurate precipitation simulations for various climate scenarios are critical for understanding and predicting the impacts of climate change. This study employs a Cycle‐generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to improve global 3‐hr‐average precipitation fields predicted by a coarse grid (200 km) atmospheric model across a range of climates, morphing them to match their statistical properties with those of reference fine‐grid (25 km) simulations. We evaluate its performance on both the target
