The effect of changes in climate
Interactions between climate and the chemical composition
of the atmosphere are manifold and act in both directions.
Changes in well-mixed greenhouse gases and ozone have di-
rect effects on radiative transfer, and thereby on temperature
and circulation. Atmospheric temperatures and circulation,
in turn, affect humidity, precipitation patterns, chemical reac-
tion rates, stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE), bound-
