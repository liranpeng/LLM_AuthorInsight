fields from the flight level to the surface. For clouds that are 5 km below the aircraft, the 
HCR minimum detectable reflectivity is about âˆ’23 dBz. On flight legs below the cloud base 
(near surface), the HCR and HSRL were facing upwards to sample clouds and aerosols 
above the flight level. During the flight legs in the clouds, the HCR and HSRL were pointing 
downwards to characterize the sub-cloud layer aerosol and precipitating fields. The
