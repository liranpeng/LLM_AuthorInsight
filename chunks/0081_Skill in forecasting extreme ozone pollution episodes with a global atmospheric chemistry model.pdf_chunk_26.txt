goal is to use all representative station data, recognizing the
heterogeneity of surface O3 that must be averaged over to
compare with gridded model simulations. The most com-
monly used technique used to compare observations with
a gridded model is to simply average all observing sites
within the grid cells to be compared (e.g., Fiore et al., 2002).
This results in an incomplete domain as well as the cal-
culated averages disproportionately representing urban sta-
