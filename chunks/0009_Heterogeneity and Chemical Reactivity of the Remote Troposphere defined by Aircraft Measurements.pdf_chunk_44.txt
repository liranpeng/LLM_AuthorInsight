at 30 s or longer such as ∼90 s for some ﬂask measurements.
Throughout ATom, gaps occur in individual species on a
range of timescales due to calibration cycles, sampling rates
or instrument malfunction. The generation of the MDS uses
a range of methods to ﬁll these gaps and assigns a ﬂag index
to each species and data point to allow users to identify pri-
mary measurements and methods used for gap-ﬁlling. Where
two instruments measure the same species, the MDS selects
