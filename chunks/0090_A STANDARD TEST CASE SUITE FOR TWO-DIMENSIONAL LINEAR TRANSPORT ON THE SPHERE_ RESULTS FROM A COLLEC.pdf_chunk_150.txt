among the best performing schemes regarding 1λm (e.g.,
UCISOM, LPM) perform poorly in terms of convergence
rate. Had the test been run in a (high-resolution) asymptotic
convergent regime, Ki and 1λm would most likely be in-
versely related. However, as mentioned the test is designed
to challenge schemes near the resolution limit rather than
