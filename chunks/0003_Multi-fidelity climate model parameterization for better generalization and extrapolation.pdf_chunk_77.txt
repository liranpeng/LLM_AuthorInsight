candidates. The corresponding temporal and spatial resolu-
tions, model spin-up and temporal sub-sampling are the same
as detailed above for SPCAM5 simulations. In the context
of multi-fidelity modelling and given the lower CAM5 com-
putational cost, the simulation time period was taken from
February 1st 2003 to January 31st 2004 in each simulation.
An analysis of the inputs and outputsâ€™ distributions for CAM5
+4K and +8K training datasets shows a broader distribution
