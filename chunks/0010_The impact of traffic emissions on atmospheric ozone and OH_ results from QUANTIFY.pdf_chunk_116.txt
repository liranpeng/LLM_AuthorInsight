these remote marine regions ozone is more sensitive to NOx-
perturbations compared to the polluted land regions, where
most of the road emissions are released.

The effects of different transport systems on tropopspheric
OH concentrations are shown in Fig. 9 for January and
July, respectively.
Interestingly, ship emissions have the
largest impact on the global OH budget in the boundary
layer. During northern summer the effect of NOx from mar-
