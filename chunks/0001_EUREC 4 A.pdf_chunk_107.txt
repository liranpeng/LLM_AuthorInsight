In Fig. 9 the vertical pressure velocity, ω, estimated from this
divergence is averaged over a set of three circles for the two
5 February circling periods. Also shown is the average over
all circles over all days. The continuity of the divergence
within a circle and across two circling periods – although
on some ﬂights vertical motion can change more markedly
across sets of circles – gives conﬁdence that the measure-
ments are capturing a physical signal. It also shows, for the
