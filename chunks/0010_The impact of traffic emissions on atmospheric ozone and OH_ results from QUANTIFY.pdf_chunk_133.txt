account for long-term equlibration to the new steady-state
value as described in Fuglestvedt et al. (1999).
Note further that our results are deduced from a small scale
perturbation and that OH is unlikely to respond linearly to a
NOx perturbation. We report here on the scaled values since
the radiative forcing calculations were performed using the
full scale perturbations to allow a robust signal to be obtained
(see below). Based on our results road emissions are only
