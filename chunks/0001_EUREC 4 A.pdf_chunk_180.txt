An example of an uncoupled DYAMOND-Winter simula-
tion using ICON is given in Fig. 19. The simulated cloud
ﬁelds exhibit rich mesoscale variability whose structure,
while plausible, begs a more quantitative evaluation. The
combination of the ﬁeld measurements and simulations with
realistic variability on the mesoscale will aid efforts to test
retrievals of physical quantities from satellite radiances. This
should make it possible to establish a self-consistent and
