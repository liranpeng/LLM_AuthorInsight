Q. Tang et al.: Interactive stratospheric ozone (O3v2) in E3SM
1221
observations (Ziemke et al., 2019). Therefore, O3v2 is able
to interact with tropopause changes and maintain the natu-
rally sharp ozone gradient across the tropopause. Linoz v2
was developed for the UCI CTM and shows consistently reli-
able stratospheric ozone simulations (Hsu and Prather, 2009).
