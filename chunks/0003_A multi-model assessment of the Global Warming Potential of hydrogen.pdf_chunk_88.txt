must keep accurate track of the rise and fall of the chemical species perturbed by
hydrogen. The methane chemical mode has a lifetime of 7â€“14 years, which means
integration needs to be performed over 60 years to accurately account for its rise
and decay.
The integral over these transients in all species has been demonstrated to be
equal to the steady-state pattern of perturbations from constant emissions scaled by
