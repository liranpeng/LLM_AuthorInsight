face temperature (ERSST) (Smith et al., 2008; Huang et al.,
2015).
Surface air temperature change over land is about twice
SST change (Fig. A3a), and thus global temperature change
is 1.3 times larger than the SST change. Note that the Arctic
Ocean and parts of the Southern Ocean are excluded in the
calculations because of inadequate data, but these regions are
also not sampled in most paleo-analyses and the excluded
areas are small. Land area included covers 29 % of the globe
