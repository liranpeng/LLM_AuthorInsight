τCH4×OH by generating 105 monte carlo realizations of
Eq. (3), allowing all parameters, αi, and lightning to vary
independently within their uncertainties. This does not ac-
count for possible errors in emissions, ozone observations,
or meteorological assimilation that are difﬁcult to quantify.
(See Fig. S6 for uncertainties in τCH4×OH due to each com-
ponent.)
Our reconstructed τCH4×OH has annual variability of 1–
2 % over the 1980–2005 period. Reductions in τCH4×OH
