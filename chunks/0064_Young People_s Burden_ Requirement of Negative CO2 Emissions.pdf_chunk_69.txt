within the range of the distribution function of Boucher et
al. (2013).
Positive net forcing (Fig. 4) causes Earth to be temporarily
out of energy balance, with more energy coming in than go-
ing out, which drives slow global warming. Eventually Earth
will become hot enough to restore planetary energy balance.
However, because of the ocean’s great thermal inertia (heat
capacity), full atmosphere–ocean response to the forcing re-
quires a long time: atmosphere–ocean models suggest that
