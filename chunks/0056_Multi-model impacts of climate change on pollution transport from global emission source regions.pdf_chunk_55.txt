ences. In particular, CMAM simulates slightly lower values
in the tropical upper troposphere in winter compared to the
other CCMs (Fig. 2c), while the GISS-E2-R simulation fea-
tures larger values above 700 hPa over northern mid-latitudes
during summer (Fig. 3d).
The spatial pattern of the CO tracer averaged over the
lower to mid-troposphere (400–800 hPa; Fig. 4) is zonally
relatively uniform in winter and is similar across the four
CCMs. This pattern also highlights the inﬂuence of strong
