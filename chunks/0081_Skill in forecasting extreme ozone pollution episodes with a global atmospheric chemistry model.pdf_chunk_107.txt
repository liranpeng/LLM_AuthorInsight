we choose AQX events to be clustered if they are within a
predeﬁned cutoff in both space and time. We use the Cheby-
shev (maximum coordinate difference) distance metric and
the single (nearest-neighbor) linkage criterion. We prescribe
a cutoff value of 1 (i.e., events are not connected at greater
than 1◦and 1 day ahead or behind). We recognize two ob-
vious limitations to using this linkage method: (1) we have
