years of observation and provide a more critical evaluation of the stratospheric influence on surface N2O.
This work uses three independent chemistry transport models (CTMs) that calculate N2O stratospheric loss 
and compares them with the loss calculated directly from NASA's Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) 
satellite observations using a photochemical box model as in Prather et al. (2015). We design new tracer
