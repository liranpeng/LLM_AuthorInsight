forcing over the period (Fig. 4d). The model range in nitrate
forcing is presently larger than for other aerosol compounds
(Myhre et al., 2013a; Shindell et al., 2013a). The strong ni-
trate forcing in the GISS model, which is likely too strong
(Shindell et al., 2013a), explains the weak and negative total
direct aerosol effect found here. Conversely, NorESM, show-
ing the highest total direct aerosol forcing, is without nitrate
aerosols. This model also shows the strongest BC forcing
