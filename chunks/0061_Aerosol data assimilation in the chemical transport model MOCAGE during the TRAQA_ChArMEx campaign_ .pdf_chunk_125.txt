trajectory. However, the proﬁle shape also evolves consid-
erably: at different moments the plume maxima are shifting
their peak heights, and the different layers are changing their
relative densities. The change of the proﬁle shape is visible
on a large part of the plume trajectory, which means that this
can be an important feature of a multi-day AOD assimilation.
There are different effects that the assimilation can have
on the proﬁle shape. While following the plume based on the
