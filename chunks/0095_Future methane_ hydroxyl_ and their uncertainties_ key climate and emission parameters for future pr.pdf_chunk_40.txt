given in Table 2 and the corresponding variables are in Fig. 3.
R2 values show correlation between each CTM and its own 5-
parameter model. GEOS-Chem simulations use either MERRA or
GEOS-5 meteorology. All lifetimes are smoothed with a 12-month
running mean.
La NiËœna, smaller peaks in 2004 and 2008, and general de-
cline after 2005. These features appear robust against the
various choices of chemical mechanism, meteorology, and
resolution used in these CTMs. In independent work, the
