Unfortunately, we cannot compare with the LBYY climate model results (their Figure 6) because their 'clear 
sky' includes, and clearly shows, the importance of northern continental pollution and southern ocean sea 
salt aerosols in their 2-stream errors.
Trying to separate the effects of δ-scaling errors from 2-stream errors for clouds, SJ/2S experiments (T1/
R13) are carried out extending the phase-function scaling exercises (T1/R9-R12 and Figure 4). The dipole
