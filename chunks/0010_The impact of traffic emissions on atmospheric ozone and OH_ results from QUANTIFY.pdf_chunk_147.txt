pared to Fuglestvedt et al. (2008). Note further that we use
a small perturbation approach. As shown in Sect. 2.1 the
ozone response to a perturbation of road trafÔ¨Åc emissions
is smaller compared to a total decline of the road emission
source. Thus, the ozone burden change and the associated
radiative forcing are likely to be smaller.
Table 8 also shows simple estimates for two further forc-
ings which result from the emissions and the consequent
