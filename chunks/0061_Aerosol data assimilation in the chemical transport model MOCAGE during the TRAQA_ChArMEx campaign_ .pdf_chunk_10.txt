ing for approaches to merge all the disparate measurements
and synthesize that knowledge (Boucher et al., 2013).
Observations are crucial in identifying aerosol proper-
ties and processes, which in turn help build more accu-
rate models. Additionally, with data assimilation techniques,
we are able to directly integrate observations in models in
order to improve modelled Ô¨Åelds (Fisher and Lary, 1995;
Elbern et al., 1997). Up to now, several research groups
