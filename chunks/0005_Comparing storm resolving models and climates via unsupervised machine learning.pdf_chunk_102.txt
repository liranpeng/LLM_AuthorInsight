corresponding to marine shallow convection (a), deep convection (b), and “Green Cumulus” convection (c). 
Panel (d) shows the shift in the mean vertical structure of each convection type with warming (solid vs. dashed 
lines). This unsupervised approach captures key signals of global warming, including geographic sorting of 
convection (a,b), expansion of arid zones over the continents (c), and anticipated changes to turbulence in a 
hotter atmosphere (d).
