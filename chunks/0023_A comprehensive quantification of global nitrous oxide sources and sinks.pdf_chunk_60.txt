America on average constitute 20% of total agricultural N2O emissions 
and largely result from the considerable increase in fertilizer nitrogen 
inputs to agricultural soils35,36. The fastest increase in emissions from 
other direct anthropogenic sources was found in East Asia, and is pri-
marily due to rapidly increasing industrial emissions. Africa and South 
Asia also show a rapid increase in emissions, arising from fossil fuels 
and industry, and from waste and waste water.
