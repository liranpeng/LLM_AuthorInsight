D distributions show that the log-normal distribution in mole
fraction (mean µ and standard deviation σ) as represented by
(µ−σ, µ, µ+σ) is for the most part very close to the equiva-
lent percentile distribution (16, 50, 84 %). For 2-D summary
statistics, we introduce a ﬁtted ellipse centered at the mean
value centroid (X0, Y0) with semimajor and semiminor axes
deﬁned as the standard deviation in the two orthogonal axes
(σX, σY ) rotated to ﬁnd the ﬂattest ellipse (i.e., maximum of
