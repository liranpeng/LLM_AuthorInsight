the isotopic values of the biogenic and biomass burning methane sources
as plants are using more depleted Î´13C in their photosynthetic process, but
these changes are well characterized (Rubino et al., 2013). The large
kinetic isotope effect associated with reaction of CH4 with chlorine atoms
introduces another source of uncertainty in the preindustrial methane iso-
tope budget that has not been addressed in previous studies (Ferretti
et al., 2005; Lassey et al., 2007; Nicewonger et al., 2018).
