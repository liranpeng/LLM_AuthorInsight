not ﬁt within the ±0.3 range – on the high side for 100–900 hPa and low side for 900–surface hPa – the column of numbers, placed on the
appropriate side and color coded to the legend, gives the fraction of occurrences outside the range. (b) Probability distribution of the natural
log of the ratio of cloudy–clear J-NO2 values (rlnJ) from 10 models and from CAFS during ATom-1. In general, J-NO2 is more responsive
to clouds than J-O1D is.
