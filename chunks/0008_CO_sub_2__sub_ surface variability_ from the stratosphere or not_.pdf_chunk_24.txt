nomials produce almost identical results for each site (not
shown), and the average third- and fourth-order Ô¨Åts are sub-
tracted to calculate the residuals. The CO2 residuals for the
average of SPO+CGO are shown in Fig. 1c as the red line,
which shows a clear annual cycle plus equally large variabil-
ity on decadal scales. The annual cycle of CO2 and its rate of
change is a critical metric used to evaluate the carbon cycle
in Earth system models (Graven et al., 2013; Zhao and Zeng,
