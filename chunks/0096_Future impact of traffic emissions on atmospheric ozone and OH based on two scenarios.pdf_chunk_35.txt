5 % or 100 %, which is consistent with the ﬁndings in Hoor et
al. (2009). The results may not be misinterpreted as contribu-
tions from the individual sectors to the ozone concentration.
Grewe et al. (2012) showed that the contribution of road traf-
ﬁc emissions to the ozone concentration is underestimated
by a factor of 5 when the contribution calculation is based on
the ratio of ozone change to emission change. They showed
in their simulation that the ozone chemistry is already satu-
