The Voronoi grid is then deformed by the ﬂow and modiﬁed
by a curvature-guard algorithm (CGA) that splits and merges
edges according to deformation criteria. The speciﬁc conﬁg-
uration of the CGA is given in Table 1 in Dong and Wang
(2013). For display and computation of diagnostics (and cou-
pling with physical parameterizations in full model setup), a
