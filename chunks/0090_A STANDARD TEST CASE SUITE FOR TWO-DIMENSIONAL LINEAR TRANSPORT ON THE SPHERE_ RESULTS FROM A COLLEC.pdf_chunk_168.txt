tends to increase ℓf for lower threshold values τ (except
τ = 0.1 for which ℓf decreases) and decrease ℓf for higher
values of τ (see Fig. 6a in LSPT2012). In other words, when
the base of the cosine bells is diffused, more area is covered
by lower values of φ and less area is covered with higher
(near peak) values of φ.
The ﬁlament diagnostic gives insight into how gradients
are distorted in terms of the ability to preserve the area of the
