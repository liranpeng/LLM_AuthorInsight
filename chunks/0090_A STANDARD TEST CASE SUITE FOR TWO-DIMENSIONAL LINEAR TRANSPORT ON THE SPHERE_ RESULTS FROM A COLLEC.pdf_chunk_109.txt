Legendre nodes for integral evaluations used in the transport
operators.
The HOMME version used here is a continuous Galerkin
ﬁnite element method that relies on globally continuous
polynomial basis functions of order p (here with p = 3 and
p = 6). Although HOMME has the capability to solve the
transport equation in advective form, it is solved in ﬂux form
(one equation for ρφ and one for ρ) for exact conservation.
A compatible discretization method is used that guarantees
