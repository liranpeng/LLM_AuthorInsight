through changes in surface ozone and particulate matter. The
effective radiative forcings are calculated from the net top
of atmosphere (TOA) ﬂux difference between atmosphere-
only simulations with identical SSTs but differing composi-
tion (Forster et al., 2016; Pincus et al., 2016). The climate
responses are calculated from the differences in climate be-
tween atmosphere–ocean simulations with differing compo-
sition.
AerChemMIP is designed to quantify the climate effects
