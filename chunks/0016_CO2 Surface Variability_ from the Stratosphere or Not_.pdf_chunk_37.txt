dard deviation for NH CO2 IAV is larger at 0.4 to 0.6 ppm
and thus even less inï¬‚uenced by stratospheric air. Thus, the
speculations of Gaubert et al. (2019) regarding atmospheric
transport can be dismissed.
The latitudinal pattern of N2O IAV provides evidence for
causes: e.g., the STE-driven signal weakens in the tropics and
changes phase in the NH, and QBO composites show a clear
separation of hemispheric sources (Ruiz et al., 2021). The
