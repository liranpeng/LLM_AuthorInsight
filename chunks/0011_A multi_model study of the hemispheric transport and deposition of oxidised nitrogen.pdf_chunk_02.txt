exported from each region annually. The strongest impact of
each source region on a foreign region is: Europe on East
Asia, North America on Europe, South Asia on East Asia,
and East Asia on North America. Europe exports the most
NOy, and East Asia the least. East Asia receives the most NOy
from the other regions. Between 8 and 15% of NOx emitted in
each region is transported over distances larger than 1000 km,
with 3â€“10% ultimately deposited over the foreign regions.
