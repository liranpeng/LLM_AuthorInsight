and scientifically grounded basis for action.
EVE will be made up of international centers of excellence, each
accessing outstanding computational and data-handling capabilities
and each embedded within the rich and expanding landscape of
climate-related data, experiences, and information. This will enable
EVE to fill a data space with climate projections of much greater
fidelity with local granularity, globally. It will link these
projections, through a digital commons, to data describing the
