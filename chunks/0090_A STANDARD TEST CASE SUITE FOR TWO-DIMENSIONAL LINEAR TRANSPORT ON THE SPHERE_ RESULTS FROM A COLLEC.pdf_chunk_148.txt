be 1λm for the unlimited scheme.
The “minimal” resolutions for the different schemes are
depicted graphically in the histogram in Fig. 3 (top row).
First of all, the 1λm range is from approximately 1/10◦to
over 2◦resolution. This is a remarkable difference in reso-
lution to achieve the same “quality” solution. In Fig. 3 the
same ordering is used for the histograms, making it easier
to compare “optimal” convergence rates visually with “min-
