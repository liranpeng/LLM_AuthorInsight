diative transfer model (Myhre et al., 2011). A small perturba-
tion is used to satisfy the linearity assumption in the methane
feedback factor derivation. In addition, we test the effect of
methane-induced water vapor on stratospheric ozone, with an
additional Oslo CTM3 simulation in which stratospheric wa-
ter vapor was increased to maintain equilibrium with the CH4
perturbation. To our knowledge, this indirect, H2O-mediated
effect on ozone has not been included in prior assessments of
