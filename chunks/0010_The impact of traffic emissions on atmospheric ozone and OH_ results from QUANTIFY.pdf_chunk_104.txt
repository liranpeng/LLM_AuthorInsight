ozone perturbation in the tropical transition layer (TTL), be-
ing of greater importance than aircraft emissions there. As
evident from Fig. 6 the impact of road and ship emissions
seems to inﬂuence the whole TTL region from 20◦S–20◦N
in particular during northern summer. During January, when
the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is located in the
southern hemisphere, where the emissions are much lower,
the TTL is only weakly affected. Note also that for the up-
