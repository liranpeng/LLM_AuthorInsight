ture of air parcels. Table 1 presents the means and medians of
each of the four reactivities (P-O3, L-O3, L-CH4, L-CO) and
two J values (J-O1D, J-NO2) for each of the eight regions
(Paciﬁc, Atlantic, central tropical Paciﬁc, eastern tropical Pa-
ciﬁc, tropical Atlantic, Southern Ocean, Arctic, Antarctic)
and four deployments (ATom-1234 in August, February, Oc-
tober, and May, respectively). Each 10 s parcel is weighted to
give equal sampling by mass from 0 to 12 km for each 10◦
