Radiosondes
Vaisala RS41-SGP radiosondes measuring atmospheric proﬁles (during ascent and descent) of tem-
perature, relative humidity, pressure, wind direction, and wind speed
UASs
Light ship-based (quadcopter) UASs were operated (during stations only) for measuring temperature
and wind speed proﬁles in the lower atmosphere (up to 300 m) and temperature proﬁles within the
upper 20 m of the ocean
