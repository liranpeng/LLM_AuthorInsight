present energy imbalance led Hansen et al. (2008, 2013a,
2016) to recommend reducing CO2 to less than 350 ppm,
with the understanding that this target must be adjusted as
CO2 declines and empirical data accumulate. The 350 ppm
CO2 target is moderately stricter than the 1.5 ◦C warm-
ing target. The near-planetary energy balance anticipated at
350 ppm CO2 implies a global temperature close to recent
values, i.e., about +1 ◦C relative to preindustrial.
