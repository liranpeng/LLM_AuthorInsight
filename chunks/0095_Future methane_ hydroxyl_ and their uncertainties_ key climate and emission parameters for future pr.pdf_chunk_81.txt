2011), the actual atmospheric sensitivity to ship NOx, likely
lies somewhere between the GEOS-Chem and UCI CTM re-
sults.
Ship NOx emissions also explain the divergence of GEOS-
Chem and the UCI CTM in their temperature sensitivities.
Over land, both models predict similar reduction in τCH4×OH
in response to warming. Over the oceans, however, GEOS-
Chem predicts longer τCH4×OH at higher temperatures while
the UCI CTM predicts the opposite. In the presence of ship
