of the boundary layer from the beginning to the end of the segments. At the beginning of the 
trajectory sample area BC the radar indicates relative solid cloud cover with drizzle and rain 
falling from the clouds. The cloud fraction from the remote sensing measurements is about 
80%. On the return flight sampling at the end of the BC trajectories, there are relatively few 
clouds with a few weak echoes from small cumuli. The lidar returns in this area show
