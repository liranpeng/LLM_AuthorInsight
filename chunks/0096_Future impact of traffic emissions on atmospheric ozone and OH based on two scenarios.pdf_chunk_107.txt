Table A1. Relative changes (%) in methane lifetime (integrated up to 50 hPa) due to a 5 % decrease in trafÔ¨Åc emissions. Values are global
annual averages given relative to the BASE simulation, and are scaled to 100 % by multiplying with 20. Note that this table does not include
the feedback effect of methane changes on its own lifetime.
