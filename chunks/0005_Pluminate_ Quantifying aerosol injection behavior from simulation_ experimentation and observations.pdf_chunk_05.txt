experiments conducted at SNL, 3D large eddy simulations of ship-
injected aerosol tracks and 2D satellite images of ship tracks. The
power of experimental data in enhancing knowledge of aerosol-
cloud interactions is in particular emphasized by studying key
aerosol microphysical and optical properties as observed through
their mixing in cloud-like environments.
