Cincinnati, OH; New York, NY; and rural Virginia). The time
series are highly correlated across these sites, but the peak
magnitudes differ across sites. In Chicago, MDA8 values
above 67 ppb exceed the local 97.3 percentile and frequently
occur a few days before local maxima in New York and Vir-
ginia, due to west-to-east motion of weather systems. If ex-
tremes were identiÔ¨Åed based on an absolute threshold (e.g.,
75 ppb), then the peak values in Chicago might not be labeled
