stantly diluted into large grid volumes, which overestimates
production of tropospheric O3 and OH. We present a suite of
model simulations that quantify this error, one of which uses
an improved, more physically realistic treatment of plume
chemistry on temporal and spatial scales smaller than the
global model grid. The limited observations of ship plume
composition during aging hamper efforts to widely evaluate
the parameterization, but we have shown that it is consis-
