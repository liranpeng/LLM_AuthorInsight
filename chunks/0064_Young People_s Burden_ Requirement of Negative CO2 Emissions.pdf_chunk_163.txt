tion (Smith et al., 2016).
The popular concept of bioenergy with carbon capture and
storage (BECCS) requires large areas and high fertilizer and
water use, and may compete with other vital land use such as
agriculture (Smith, 2016). Costs estimates are ∼USD 150–
350 (tC)−1 for crop-based BECCS (Smith et al., 2016).
Direct air capture has more limited area and water needs
than BECCS and no fertilizer requirement, but it has high
energy use, has not been demonstrated at scale, and cost esti-
