mate of the total RF from ship NOx is −4.0 ± 2.0 mW m−2.
Our RF estimate derives from marginal (5 %) changes in
ship NOx emissions. Scaling the marginal RF up to year
2010 total emissions of 6.8 Tg(N) yr−1 (Eide et al., 2013)
suggests an RF of −27.2 ± 13.6 mW m−2, but the average
RF of all ship NOx emissions is likely about 20 % larger
(−33 mW m−2) because of non-linearity in O3 production.
Our best estimates of individual RF components have 1σ
