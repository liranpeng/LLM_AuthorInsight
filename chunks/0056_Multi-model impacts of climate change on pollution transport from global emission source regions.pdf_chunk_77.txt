STOC-HadAM3, which are driven by the same GCM (up to
8 × 10−3 kgm−2 s−1), the spatial patterns and seasonality of
convection are consistent across all models (Figs. 6 and 7).
For example, in the tropics and subtropics, the strongest con-
vective mass ﬂuxes shift location from 10–20◦S in winter to
10–20◦N in summer as the ITCZ migrates south and north-
wards of the Equator. Convective mass ﬂuxes are also large
in the northern mid-latitudes in winter and in the southern
