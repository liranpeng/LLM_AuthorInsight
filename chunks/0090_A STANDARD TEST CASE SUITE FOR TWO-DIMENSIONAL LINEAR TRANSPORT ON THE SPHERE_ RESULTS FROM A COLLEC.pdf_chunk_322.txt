olution for CN ≈1. The cases in this paper are equivalent to
many revolutions in this test case, and results for UCISOM
look like some of the worst cases in Fig. 5, with peak tracer
< 0.8. After results were completed for this study, a variant
of L = 3 was tested, whereby the minimum–maximum crite-
rion for the daughter cell is relaxed: the tracer is allowed to
overshoot the parent min–max by a percentage. For large al-
lowances (i.e., 3 %) the L = 3 case begins to look like L = 2
