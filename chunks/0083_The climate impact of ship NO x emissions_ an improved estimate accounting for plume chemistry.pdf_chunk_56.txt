−1.4 %) derived from models that used small inventories of
ship emissions and calculated sensitivities by removing all
ship NOx emissions (Endresen et al., 2003; Lawrence and
Crutzen, 1999). This suggests that the non-linear aspects of
NOx-ozone chemistry inﬂuence the spread of model results
and we investigate this further in Sect. 4.
Treatment of ship plume chemistry has an important ef-
fect on the current CH4 lifetime, as well as its perturbations
