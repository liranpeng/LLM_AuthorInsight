seasons, with the strongest decreases occurring within the
tropics along the ITCZ, in agreement with tropical convective
mass ﬂux reductions diagnosed by Held and Soden (2006).
However, in contrast to our ﬁndings, Abalos et al. (2017)
suggests decreases in convection mass ﬂuxes are limited to
∼5 km. Decreased convective mass ﬂuxes in our study are
consistent with a weakening of the Hadley cell in winter
when this feature is robust (Hwan-Seo et al., 2014; Kang
