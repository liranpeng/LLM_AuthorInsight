(Group 1) and UCI (Group 2) have very similar CODs and
CFs in the lower troposphere as shown in Fig. S6. They
also use similar J-value codes including spectral and scat-
tering data based on the Fast-J module. Yet, they have a
factor of 2 difference in the frequency of nearly cloud-free
sky as shown in Fig. 5. Compared to GMI, UCI shows an
overall greater impact of clouds with 2 times larger fre-
quency of cloud brightening in the upper troposphere and 2
