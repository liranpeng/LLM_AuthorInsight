and a non-trainable (so-called “prior”) surrogate model; we
used fully-connected neural network for simplicity. Multiple
replicas of the networks are constructed by independent and
random sampling of both trainable and non-trainable param-
eters60,68. The non-trainable parameters are initialized but
then kept fixed during the fitting process which only optimizes
over the trainable parameters. In our case of fully-connected
neural networks, we resort to Glorot initialization69, which
