Time-slice historical ERF simulations (in support
of science questions 2.1 and 2.3)
The quantiÔ¨Åcation of pre-industrial to present-day ERFs due
to different drivers (such as in Myhre et al., 2013a, Fig. 8.17)
is used widely. The AerChemMIP time-slice experiments
will provide the data to generate a consistent table of present-
day ERFs for the reactive gases and aerosols. The ERFs
