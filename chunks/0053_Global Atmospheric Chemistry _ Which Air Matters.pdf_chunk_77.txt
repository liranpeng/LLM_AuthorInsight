For some species like HCHO, the daytime loss frequency in
the tropics is about 1/2 hâˆ’1 (see for example loss photolysis
rates for various oxygenated hydrocarbons in Prather, 2015),
and thus one might expect it to vary greatly over the sunlight
day or with cloud variations. The diurnal change in 1-D dis-
tributions of the 6 key species is also shown in Fig. 2 for the
C-runs at 18 h (local solar time, red dashed), 24 h (dark blue
dashed), and 30 h (green dashed). The C-runs are in approxi-
