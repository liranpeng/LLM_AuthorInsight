et al., 2013) referred to as SFF-CSLAM3 and SFF-CSLAM4,
respectively. Shape preservation in SFF-CSLAM is enforced
by reconstruction function-limiting (slope-limiting); more
speciﬁcally the maxima and minima are identiﬁed within
each element, and the reconstruction function is scaled to
ﬁt within the minimum and maximum of the neighboring
cell-average values (Barth and Jespersen, 1989). Since sim-
pliﬁed ﬂux-area integration is used, reconstruction functions
