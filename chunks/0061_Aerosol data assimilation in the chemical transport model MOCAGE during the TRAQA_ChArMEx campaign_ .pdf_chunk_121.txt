ferent physical processes (e.g. dry and wet deposition, sed-
imentation). Therefore, we cannot follow the dust plume by
following an air parcel. Instead, to track the plume we use
a criterion based on the high values of AOD. The plume,
after its emission, heads west and passes over a couple of
other dust sources. Near the Canary Islands the plume turns
north-east towards the Mediterranean basin under the inï¬‚u-
ence of a low-pressure system centred near the British Isles.
