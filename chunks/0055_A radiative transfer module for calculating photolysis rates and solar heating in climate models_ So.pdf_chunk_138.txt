tio of solar radiation at the surface. The original Fast-J work
(Wild et al., 2000) examined a range of multi-stream scatter-
ing models and found that for typical clouds, an eight-stream
solution was able to match within a few percent that of a
100-stream code for the mean intensity above, within and be-
low the cloud. A major advantage of the eight-stream system
was that no delta scaling was needed and a simply truncated
