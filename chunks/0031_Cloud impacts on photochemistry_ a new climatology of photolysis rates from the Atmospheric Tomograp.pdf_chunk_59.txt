Modeling the distribution of J values
The probability distribution of rlnJ for J-O1D (Fig. 4a) and
J-NO2 (Fig. 4b) shows highly varied patterns across the
models, but with some consistency. The models and CAFS
are not exactly a match, but again, there are some encour-
aging patterns. The peak rlnJ distributions for CAFS will
be broadened because the real variation in ocean surface
albedo is not simulated in TUV (see discussion in Sect. 4),
