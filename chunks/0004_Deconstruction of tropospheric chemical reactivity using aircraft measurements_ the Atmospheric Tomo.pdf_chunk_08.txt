Introduction
The environmental damage caused by chemically reactive
greenhouse gases and most air pollutants is controlled by a
balance between their sources and sinks, with atmospheric
photochemistry as the major sink. The net chemical loss is
comprised of a highly heterogeneous mixture of air parcels,
