Africa)2,9,13. Moreover, a complete account of all human activities that 
accelerate the global nitrogen cycle and that interact with the bio-
chemical processes controlling the fluxes of N2O in both terrestrial and 
aquatic ecosystems is required2,8. Here we present a comprehensive, 
consistent analysis and synthesis of the global N2O budget across all 
sectors, including natural and anthropogenic sources and sinks, using 
both bottom-up and top-down methods and their cross-constraints.
