turn inﬂuence precipitation formation, a process that Seifert
and Heus (2013) suggest may be self-reinforcing, consistent
with an apparent link between precipitation and mesoscale
cloud patterns such as “ﬁsh” or “ﬂowers” (Stevens et al.,
2019b).
On larger (20 to 200 km) scales, horizontal transport,

clouds, as well as factors such as the tropospheric stability, or
patterns of mesoscale convergence and divergence, which in-
