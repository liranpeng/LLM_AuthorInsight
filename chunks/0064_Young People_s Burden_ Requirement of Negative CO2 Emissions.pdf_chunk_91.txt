25 % (Lorius et al., 1990; Hansen et al., 2007; Masson-
Delmotte et al., 2013). In simple terms, the ocean and land
release more of these gases as the planet becomes warmer.
Mechanisms that control GHG release as Earth warms, and
GHG drawdown as Earth cools, are complex, including many
processes that affect the distribution of carbon, among the
ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere (Yu et al., 2016; Ciais
et al., 2013, and references therein). Release of carbon
