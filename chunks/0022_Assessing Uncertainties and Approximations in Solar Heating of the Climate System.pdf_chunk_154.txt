not linearly scalable with resolution. We believe that a MAX-COR or MAX-EXP algorithm is likely the most 
stable and scalable deterministic ICA generator for vertical cloud decorrelation algorithms. The RRTMG 
v4.0 code available at the time of this study uses primarily MAX-RAN cloud overlap, but the new v5.0 code 
includes an EXP-RAN option. Thus, our comparisons of cloud-overlap results with the RRTMG code are
