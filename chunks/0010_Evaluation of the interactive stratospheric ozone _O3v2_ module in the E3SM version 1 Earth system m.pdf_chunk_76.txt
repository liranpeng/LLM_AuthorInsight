means.
Figure 6 illustrates the multi-year seasonal cycle of the
STE ozone ﬂux in each hemisphere for O3v2 (red) and UCI
(green). The annual mean values are similar in both models:
in the NH (solid lines) these are 215 Tg O3 yr−1 for UCI and
215 for O3v2, and in the SH (dashed) these are 190 and 170.
The seasonal amplitude for UCI is, however, twice as large as
that for O3v2. For O3v2 the NH STE ﬂux (solid lines) maxi-
mizes in May and minimizes in December, while for UCI,
