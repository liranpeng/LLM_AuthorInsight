OH and temperature could alter the MCF decay rate. For iii, one
must recognize that our measurements of MCF are made at the
surface and do not discern vertical gradients or the relative
amounts in the stratosphere. Fluctuations in such mixing rates
are not documented, but they could alter the apparent decay
rate. The new models here use option ii to alter the decay rate
and thus predict trends in OH. The problem with ii is that, to be
effective, the continuing MCF emissions must follow the same
