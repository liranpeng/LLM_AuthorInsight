significant distances from the source regions and deposited
over a wide area. EA emissions are transported across the
Pacific to the west coast of NA, but no further. Conversely,
the majority of the emissions from SA are deposited within
the same region, or adjacent to it. In this latter case, a
significant amount of the NOy will be removed by convec-
tive rainout; the high temperatures associated with SA
promote thermal decomposition of insoluble PAN, and
