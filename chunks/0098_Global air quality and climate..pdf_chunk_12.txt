Introduction
Air pollutants and their precursors can force the climate
system by altering solar and terrestrial radiation budgets, and
their distributions are in turn highly dependent upon regional
climate. We focus here on two major global air pollutants, ozone
(O3) and aerosols (referred to interchangeably with particulate
matter below) in the near-surface atmospheric boundary layer.
Increases in surface O3 and particulate matter (with diameter
