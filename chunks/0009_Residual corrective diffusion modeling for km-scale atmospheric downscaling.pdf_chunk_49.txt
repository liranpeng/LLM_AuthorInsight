Discussion
This study presents a generative diffusion model (CorrDiff) for
multivariate downscaling of coarse-resolution (25 km) global
weather states to higher resolution (2 km) over a subset of the
globe, and simultaneous radar channel synthesis. CorrDiff consists
of two steps: regression and generation. The regression step
approximates the mean, while the generation step further corrects
