model ozone for the year 2000, and present modeled ozone
change since preindustrial times. In Sect. 3 we present the
results of the radiative transfer calculations, followed by con-
cluding remarks and suggested future directions in Sect. 4.

Atmospheric composition change
2.1
Description of models
We have used seven coupled chemistry-climate models
(CCMs) and three chemical transport models (CTMs) to
calculate atmospheric composition change since the prein-
dustrial era (1850).
