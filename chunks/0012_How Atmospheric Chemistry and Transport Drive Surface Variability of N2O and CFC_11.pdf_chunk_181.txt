Supplementary Figure S4. Surface change (ppb/yr) during the anomalous 2010/11 QBO phase 
transition (08/2010 = 0 months).  The top panels and middle left are from modeled N2OX (GMI, 
LMDz5, UCI) scaled to a mean tropospheric N2O abundance of 320 ppb. The middle right panel is from 
NOAA ESRL observations, also scaled to 320 ppb.  The bottom panels are of modeled F11X (GMI and 
UCI only) rescaled to N2OX at 320 ppb. Note, the scale of the F11X colorbar is twice that of
