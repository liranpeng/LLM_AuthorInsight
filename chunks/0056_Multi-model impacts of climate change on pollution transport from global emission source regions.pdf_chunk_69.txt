ratios is explored further in Sect. 4.2. This near-tropopause
increase in CO-tracer mixing ratios in the northern mid- to
high latitudes is also consistent with future increases in pole-
ward transport reported by Orbe et al. (2015) based on trac-
ers of air-mass origin. Increases in the vertically integrated
CO-tracer column between the 2000s and 2090s between 30
and 40â—¦N in all models also suggest an increase in advective
transport poleward, since vertical redistribution alone would
