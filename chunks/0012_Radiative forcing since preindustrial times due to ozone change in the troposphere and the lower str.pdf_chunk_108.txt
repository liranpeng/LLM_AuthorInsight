ozone precursors (which is not included in the difference “2
minus 1a”). Qualitatively the results of the other three mod-
els allow the same conclusions, although the magnitude of
the effect varies. In the ULAQ model the stratospheric re-
duction amounts to −18.3 DU for “2 minus 1a” and to only
−17.5 DU for “2 minus 1c”, probably reﬂecting the inﬂu-
ence of the ozone precursor increase, which is included in
