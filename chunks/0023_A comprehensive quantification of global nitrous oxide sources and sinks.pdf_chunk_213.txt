between average global annual land surface temperature and simulated N2O 
emissions (that is, the result of SE6 experiment in NMIP16) considering annual 
changes in climate but keeping all other factors (that is, nitrogen fertilizer, 
manure, NDEP, increased CO2 and land cover change) at the level of 1860. b, The 
correlation between average global annual land surface temperature and 
simulated N2O emissions (that is, the result of SE1 experiment in NMIP16)
