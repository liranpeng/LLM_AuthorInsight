of increase of 0.8 ± 0.2 Tg N yr−1 per decade (95% confidence interval; 
P < 0.05) compared with 1.1 ± 0.6 Tg N yr−1 per decade (P < 0.05) from 
the top-down approach (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Since 2005, the differ-
ence in the magnitude of emissions between the two approaches has 
become smaller owing to a large increase in emission—particularly in 
South America, Africa and East Asia—that is inferred by the top-down 
approach (Extended Data Fig. 3d, f, i). Oceanic N2O emissions from the
