convection, introducing more physical approximations com-
pared to SPCAM5, which resolves deep convection. In addi-
tion, radiation in CAM5 is estimated every 2 time-steps, while
the radiation is estimated every 1 time-step for SPCAM5 by
default. Therefore, CAM5 is a good candidate for a low-
fidelity model of SPCAM5, as it is computationally cheaper
but also less accurate. For all CAM5 and SPCAM5 simula-
tions, the cosine of the solar zenith angle is estimated as a
