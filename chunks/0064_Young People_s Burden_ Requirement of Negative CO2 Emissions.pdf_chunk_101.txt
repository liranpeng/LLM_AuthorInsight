Observed CO2 and CH4 growth rates
Annual increase in atmospheric CO2, averaged over a few
years, grew from less than 1 ppm yr−1 50 years ago to more
than 2 ppm yr−1 today (Fig. 6), with global mean CO2 now
exceeding 400 ppm (Betts et al., 2016). Growth of atmo-
spheric CO2 is about half of fossil fuel CO2 emissions as dis-
cussed in Appendix A8 and illustrated in Fig. A8. The large
