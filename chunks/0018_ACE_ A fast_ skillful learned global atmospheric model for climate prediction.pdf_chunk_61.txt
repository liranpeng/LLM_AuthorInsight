round-trip on this dataset we truncated the highest-frequency modes (35% of all modes), which had
the effect of reducing the baselineâ€™s errors against the reference dataset.
In future work, it would be natural to directly train on the cubed sphere grid data, which would
prevent complications associated with regridding. The cubed sphere grid has been used for ML-
