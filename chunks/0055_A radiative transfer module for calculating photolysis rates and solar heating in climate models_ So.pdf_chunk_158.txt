grid cell square (âˆ¼2500 column atmospheres) could achieve
10 times greater or faster speedups for Solar-J and be ap-
propriate for a massively parallel climate simulation (e.g.,
32 000 nodes for a 50 km global grid). With such speedups,
Solar-J costs would be comparable or possibly less than those
of the current RRTMG-SW and thus become a marginal cost
in the climate simulation.

Other parameterizations for wavelength bins
Solar-J uses its own optimization of wavelength bins at ultra-
