vations are taken at their exact times to the nearest minute;
i.e. every measurement is compared with the background at
the time of measurement, as in 4-D-Var. The optimal analysis
is estimated only for a speciÔ¨Åed moment in the assimilation
cycle, as in 3-D-Var, and not for the whole trajectory, as in
4-D-Var. Thus, compared to 4-D-VAR, during the assimila-
tion the information given by observations is not propagated
in time, and consequently we do not need the linearized op-
