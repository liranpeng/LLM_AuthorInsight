can oﬀset O3 decreases obtained with regional emission con-
trols, e.g., ref. 28 and 66 For example, under the RCP8.5
scenario, the O3 decreases over North America are at least
partially oﬀset by rising external sources until 2040, and rising
global CH4 raises baseline O3 levels over the entire northern
hemisphere (Fig. 4).66 The contribution from CH4 to baseline
surface O3 is fairly uniform globally, although the annual
mean O3 sensitivity to CH4 ranges by a factor of two across
