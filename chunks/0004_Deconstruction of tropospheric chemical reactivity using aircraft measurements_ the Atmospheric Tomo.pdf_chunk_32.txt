we show how the ATom parcel reactivities and sensitivities
can be used to derive chemical feedbacks, such as the life-
time for O3 perturbations and the CH4 lifetime feedback fac-
tor. Section 7 concludes this analysis.

Reactivity statistics â€“ means and extremes
We developed statistics that identify extremes (i.e., photo-
chemical hotspots) and characterize the heterogeneous mix-
