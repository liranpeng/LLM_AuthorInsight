where the radar and lidar were used to characterize clouds in the boundary layer and 
dropsondes were used to define boundary layer structure. Extensive observations of key 
features of cloud system evolution were madeâ€”mesoscale precipitating cloud complexes, 
gray cloud layers, and ultra clean layers at boundary layer top in areas far removed from 
areas sampled on past aircraft missions.
This project demonstrated the power of EOL Field Catalog II for mission planning, flight
