differences among storm-resolving models”, “Dynamic consistency between high-resolution climate models”), 
we found a split between six similar GSRMs and three divergent GSRMs. Specifically, our analysis revealed that 
ICON had a lower proportion of shallow convection compared to other GSRMs, SAM contained unusually 
intense “Deep Convection”, and SPCAM exhibited small scale turbulence with distinct profiles of √
