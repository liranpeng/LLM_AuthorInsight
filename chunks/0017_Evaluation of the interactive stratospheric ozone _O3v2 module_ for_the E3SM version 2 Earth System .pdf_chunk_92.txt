December–May, suggesting changes in the high clouds or the
phase partitioning of mixed-phase clouds during this period.
The surface precipitation is similar for all seasons, with the
exception of June–August when the O3v2 result is slightly
improved. Greater changes are found in the thermodynamic
ﬁelds due to the climate–dynamics interactions related to the
polar vortex and the ozone hole discussed in the previous
section. The changes to these ﬁelds are mostly towards dete-
