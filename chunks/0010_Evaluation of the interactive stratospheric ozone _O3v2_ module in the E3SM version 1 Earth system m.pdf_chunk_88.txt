deterioration of other parts. The more physical representa-
tions of processes do not necessarily lead to better model per-
formance against observations. Therefore, it is critical to en-
sure that the O3v2 scheme does not cause signiÔ¨Åcant degra-
dation of the simulated mean climate or the climate sensitiv-
ity. Here we apply the same diagnostic to examine the overall
climate performance as was used in the E3SMv1 overview
papers (Golaz et al., 2019; Caldwell et al., 2019). In this
