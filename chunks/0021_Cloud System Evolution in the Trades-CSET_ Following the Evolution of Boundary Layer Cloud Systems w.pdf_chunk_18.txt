then a re-sampling of these same air masses on the return flight two days later.
The stratocumulus-trade cumulus transition is often sharply defined as shown in Fig. 1. The 
upstream part of the transition was arguably first examined with five NCAR Electra flights 
undertaken in 1975 and documented in Brost et al. (1982a; 1982b) and Albrecht et al. 
(1985). The Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment (ASTEX; Albrecht et al., 1995a)
