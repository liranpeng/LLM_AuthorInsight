for 75 epochs while the second uses a 100-year dataset (146070 samples) and trains for 15 epochs.
Note the latter training is not the same as the one described in the main text above. It does not use
surface height or surface type fractions as inputs and it uses a 5x larger initial learning rate.
Figure 14 shows the training and validation loss for the models trained on the two datasets. The
validation loss here is computed on 80 samples from the independent validation dataset. The model
