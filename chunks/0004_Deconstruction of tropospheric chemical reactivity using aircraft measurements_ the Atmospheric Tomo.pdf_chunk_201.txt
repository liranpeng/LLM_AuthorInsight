OH and amplify the ffCH4.
We can make a simple, ﬁrst-order estimate of this CO ad-
justment to a 10 % CH4 increase. The sOH directly from the
CH4 change averages −0.22 (Table 2, average of the Paciﬁc
and Atlantic) or −2.2 % in the loss frequency of CH4. The
change in L-CO from the 10 % CH4 increase is −1.9 % (Ta-
ble 2, average of the Paciﬁc and Atlantic). If CO is in bal-
ance between the sources and L-CO, then CO will increase
by 1.9 %. The two-basin average sensitivity of L-CH4 to CO
