ing, the quasi-boomerang has a strong central line with a neg-
ative slope. With P-O3, a much broader range is seen and the
peak occurrence shifts to lower HOOH values and somewhat
even to lower NOx values. With L-CH4, the line disappears
and a galaxy-like pattern widens the range of parcels, picking
up lower NOx values in two spiral arms. The L-O3 weighting
is similar to L-CH4, and differences are discernable only in
small features. Clearly, species other than NOx and HOOH
