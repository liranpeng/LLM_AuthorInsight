evolutions. CSET demonstrated the feasibility of a Lagrangian sampling strategy with NSF/
NCAR GV aircraft to study cloud system evolution. The range, endurance, and 
observational capabilities of the GV make it an ideal tool for studying shallow boundary 
layer clouds and mesoscale cloud systems over large domains. The HCR and HSRL remote 
sensing capabilities on the GV were critical to the success of CSET. They provided a
