fraction cumulus below. Thus, a seventh MAX group is
added if there was a cirrus shield (deﬁned from top down as
adjacent ice-only clouds with f > 0.5). Because of the cloud-
fraction binning into 10 % intervals, the number of ICAs is
bounded by 5 × 106 (including the cirrus shield). This limit is
resolution independent and was never reached in any FCAs
examined here (highest number of ICAs for one FCA was
3500). The major computational cost comes with the Fast-J
