aries of the source regions.
[14] The influence of the anthropogenic emissions of
NOx from each of the four source regions on global NOy
deposition is illustrated in Figure 3. Here, each panel shows
the percentage reduction in the annual total NOy deposition
fluxes in each of the NOx emission perturbation experi-
ments, as compared with the control simulation, using
multi-model mean values from each simulation. The emis-
sions from NA and especially EU are clearly transported
