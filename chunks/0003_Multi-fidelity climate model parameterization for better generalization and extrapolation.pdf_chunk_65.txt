provide the best of both worlds: the capacity to extrapolate
based on low-fidelity data exploring many regimes of con-
vection and the higher accuracy based on high-fidelity data
covering more limited regimes because of its computational
cost. Hence, the MF-based parameterization narrows further
the gap between the climate science and machine-learning
communities by (1) building trust in the capacity of ML-based
parameterization to extrapolate to unknown scenarios thanks
