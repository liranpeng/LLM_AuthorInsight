consistent with the constraint provided by methyl chloro-
form observations, 11.2 ± 1.3 yr (Prather et al., 2012), but all
are within the range of contemporary tropospheric chemistry
models (e.g. 9.7 ± 1.5 yr from ACCMIP, Naik et al., 2012).
These simulations show similar variability of τCH4×OH in
all CTMs. Common features include a sharp dip in 1998
and peak in 2000, coincident with a strong El Ni˜no and
