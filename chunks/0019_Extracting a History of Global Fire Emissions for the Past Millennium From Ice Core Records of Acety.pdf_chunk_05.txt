changes in other factors such as meteorological transport or atmospheric photochemical lifetimes appear to
be required to reconcile the trace gas records.
Plain Language Summary Biomass burning (wildÔ¨Åres) are an important component of the
climate system. Understanding how biomass burning has changed in the past can help us better predict
how biomass burning may change in the future. This study examines ice core measurements of three trace
