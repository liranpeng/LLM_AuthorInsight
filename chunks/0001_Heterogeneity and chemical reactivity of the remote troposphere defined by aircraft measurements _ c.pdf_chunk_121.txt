itude by 200 hPa pressure bin and then also by cosine (lat-
itude) to compare with the models. In addition, a PD was
calculated from the 1◦by 200 m average grid-cell values in
Fig. 2 (black Xs), and this is also cosine (latitude)-weighted.
To check if the high reactivities in the eastern Paciﬁc affected
the whole Paciﬁc PD, a separate PD using only central Paciﬁc
