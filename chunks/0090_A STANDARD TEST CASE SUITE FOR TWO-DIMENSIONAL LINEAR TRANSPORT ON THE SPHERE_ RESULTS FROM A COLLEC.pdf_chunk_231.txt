ﬁnite-volume schemes, the coupling between air mass and
tracer mass must be considered in divergent ﬂow settings
(see, for example, Sect. 2.1 in Nair and Lauritzen, 2010).
Hence this test case forces the modeler to consider such cou-
pling that may otherwise not be considered when the ﬂow
is non-divergent. That said, even for the non-divergent ﬂow
ﬁeld, the non-preservation of a constant mixing ratio could
be a result of inconsistent coupling between air and tracer
