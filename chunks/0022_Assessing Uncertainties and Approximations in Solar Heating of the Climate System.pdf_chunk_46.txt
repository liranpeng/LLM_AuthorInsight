spectral model; Solar-J extends its reference solar table (Watts m−2) to match RRTMG; and photon fluxes 
are not used since photolysis only occurs in bins #1–18. For the tropospheric wavelengths (#13–18), the bins 
are contiguous wavelength bands, and only ozone absorption and Rayleigh scattering affect the fluxes, see 
Figure 2.
3.1.  The Wavelength Region 290–778 nm
We expected a simple, or at least explicable comparison of SJ with the RRTMG-SW v4.0 standalone code
