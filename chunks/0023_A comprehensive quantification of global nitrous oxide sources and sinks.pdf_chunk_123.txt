ture’. Data for ‘Direct soil emissions’ were obtained as the ensemble 
mean of N2O emissions from an average of three inventories (EDGAR 
v4.3.2, FAOSTAT and GAINS), the SRNM/DLEM models and the NMIP/
DLEM models. The statistical model SRNM covers only cropland N2O 
emissions, the same as the NMIP. Thus, we add the DLEM-based esti-
mate of pasture N2O emissions into the two estimates in cropland to 
represent direct agricultural soil emissions (that is, SRNM/DLEM or
