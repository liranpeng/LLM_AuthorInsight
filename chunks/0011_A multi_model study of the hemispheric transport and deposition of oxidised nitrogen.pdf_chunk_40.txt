receptor matrix was created using annual deposition totals.
This matrix indicated that the largest impacts of Europe are
on East Asia, North America on Europe, South Asia on East
Asia, and East Asia on North America. 8â€“15% of NOx
emitted from each region is transported over distances larger
than 1000 km, and between 34 and 49% of the exported
NOy is deposited within 1000 km. Between 3 and 10% of
the NOx emitted from each region was deposited as NOy in
