the same levels of sophistication activated in the chemistry
and aerosol schemes, and with the AerChemMIP diagnostics
as speciﬁed in Sect. 4. It is likely that groups will ﬁrst spin up
their model to pre-industrial conditions without interactive
chemistry. This would then be followed by a shorter spin-
up with fully interactive chemistry for as long as is needed
to ensure the chemistry does not introduce any additional
drift. This process will be quicker if the non-chemistry spin-
