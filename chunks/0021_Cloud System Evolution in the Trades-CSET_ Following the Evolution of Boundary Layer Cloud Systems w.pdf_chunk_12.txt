Hartmann 1993). Cu, on the other hand, play a fundamental role in the regulation of ocean 
surface evaporation and convergence of moisture into deep convective regions (e.g., Tiedtke 
1989, Neggers et al. 2007), and therefore the global hydrological cycle. The transition from 
shallow, cloud-topped MBLs in the cool subtropics to broken trade cumulus over the warm 
tropics (Bretherton and Wyant 1997, Bretherton et al. 1999, Sandu and Stevens 2011) occurs
