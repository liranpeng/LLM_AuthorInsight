active species and ﬂies down the middle of the Paciﬁc and
Atlantic oceans, proﬁling as frequently as possible. The re-
sulting climatology represents the heterogeneity of the atmo-
sphere, including the covariance of key reactive species.
This approach is tested here using six CTMs–CCMs de-
scribed in Table 1. It allows us to identify models that look
alike in reactivity statistics and those that are distinctly dif-
ferent. We have seen large uniform anomalies in a speciﬁc
