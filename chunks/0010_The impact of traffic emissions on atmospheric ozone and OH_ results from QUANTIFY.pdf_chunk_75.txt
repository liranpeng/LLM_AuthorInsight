which leads to ozone perturbations ranging from 0.5 DU
(TM4) to 2 DU (p-TOMCAT). Largest relative deviations oc-
cur over the tropical central Paciﬁc, where perturbations of
ozone are relatively low. Thus, small perturbations may lead
to relatively large variations between the models. Note how-
ever, that calculated ozone perturbations in particular over
Europe and the central Atlantic are relatively robust indicat-
ing a signiﬁcant impact of trafﬁc emissions in these regions.
