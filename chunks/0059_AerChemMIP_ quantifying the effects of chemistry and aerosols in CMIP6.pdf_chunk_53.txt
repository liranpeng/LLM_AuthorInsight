How do uncertainties in historical NTCF emissions
affect radiative forcing estimates?
The primary focus of this question is to understand the sen-
sitivity of present-day ERF to uncertainties in estimates of
historical NTCF emissions. Indeed, while all proposed sim-
ulations rely on the usage of a central estimate, it is clear
