spheric chemistry studies (Savage et al., 2004; Law et al.,
2000, 1998). Convective transport was based on the mass
ï¬‚ux parameterization of Tiedtke (1989). The parametriza-
tions includes descriptions of deep and shallow convection
with convective updrafts and largescale subsidence, as well
as turbulent and organized entrainment and detrainment. The
model contains a nonlocal vertical diffusion scheme based on
the parameterization of Holtslag and Boville (1993).
