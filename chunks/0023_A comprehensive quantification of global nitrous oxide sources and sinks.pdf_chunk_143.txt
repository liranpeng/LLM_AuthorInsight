over the N2O emission from the nearby reference mature forest. In the 
second function, x indicates secondary forest age and y indicates the 
ratio of secondary forest N2O emission over that of a reference mature 
forest. This form of the response functions can effectively reproduce 
the short-lived increase in soil N2O emissions after initial forest clear-
ing and the gradually declining emission rates of converted crops and/
