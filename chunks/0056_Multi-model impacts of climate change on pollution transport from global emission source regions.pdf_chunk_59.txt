face) which is shallower in the southern tropics during win-
ter and in the northern tropics in summer (not shown) due
to greater vertical mixing from convective lofting along the
ITCZ (Sect. 4.1). Note that seasonal differences related to the
transport of anthropogenic sources in the mid-latitudes may
also be important, with strong surface lofting in winter storm
tracks resulting in larger CO-tracer mixing ratios over the
northern extratropics during winter (Fig. 4) than in summer
(Fig. 5).
