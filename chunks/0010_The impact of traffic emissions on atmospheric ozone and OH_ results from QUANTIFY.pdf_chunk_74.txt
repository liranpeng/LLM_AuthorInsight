similar patterns with a relative standard deviation mostly be-
low 15% over large regions of the globe where the effect of
the perturbation is strongest. In the southern hemisphere, the
relative standard deviations are in general somewhat higher
(between 20–30%), since the absolute column perturbations
(Fig. 3c and 3d) are not as large as in the northern hemi-
sphere. The large absolute deviation over the northern Paciﬁc
Ocean during July is caused by the impact of ship emissions,
