perturbation, whereas the North Atlantic region additionally
is affected by road emissions, which are transported efÔ¨Å-
ciently from the highly polluted Eastern US to the Atlantic.
Not too surprising, in the northern UTLS region (up-
per troposphere / lower stratosphere) the effect of aircraft
emissions dominates the ozone perturbation (Fig. 6) being
approximately half as large during January compared to July
associated with the enhanced level of photochemistry. The
