and highlight different aspects of the chemistry–climate sys-
tem. For example, case [2] may highlight errors in using a
pieced-forecast meteorology (UCI) as opposed to one from a
continuously solved dynamical core (EAM).

Stratospheric ozone proﬁles
The distribution of O3 within the stratosphere is important
not only as a diagnostic of chemistry and transport but also
as the driver of stratospheric heating. We thus choose a met-
ric based on the Aura MLS observations of the monthly zonal
