prescribed for this assessment; instead, each modelling group
used their own best estimate of emissions for 2001. This
course was followed because differences in emissions of both
natural and anthropogenic precursor gases are an important
source of uncertainty which we wished to include in our
results (although the source-receptor relationships should be
independent of the magnitude of the emissions). The global
