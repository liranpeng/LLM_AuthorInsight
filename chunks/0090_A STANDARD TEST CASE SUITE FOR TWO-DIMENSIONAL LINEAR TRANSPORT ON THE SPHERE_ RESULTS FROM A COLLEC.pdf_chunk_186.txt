chosen not to depict/list the conventional error norms as we
did not ﬁnd any qualitative insights that were not visible in
the contour plots (the error norms are available in the supple-
mental material for the interested reader). So in the interest
of reducing the number of ﬁgures/tables, errors ℓ2, and ℓ∞,
as well as the minimum and maximum norms, are not shown.
All contour plots use the same coloring scale and contour
interval making it straightforward to compare schemes vi-
