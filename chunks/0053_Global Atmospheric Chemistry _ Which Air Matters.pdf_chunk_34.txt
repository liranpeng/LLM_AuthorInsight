simpliﬁed statistics describing these probability distributions
are presented and discussed in the Supplement to this pa-
per. The full distributions and simple statistics clearly show
the basic differences in chemical heterogeneity and reactivity
across the six models. We conclude in Sect. 5 with a sum-
mary of the model comparisons and what is learned from the
new diagnostics. We also discuss the ongoing NASA ATom
mission (2015–2020), which will provide the air parcel mea-
