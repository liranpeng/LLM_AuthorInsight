uncertainties in projections of future climate change include
climate sensitivity, the effects of ocean mixing and dynam-
ics on the climate response function discussed below, and
aerosol climate forcing. We provide all deﬁning data so that
others can easily repeat calculations with alternative choices.
One clariﬁcation is important for our present paper.
The climate calculations in this section include only fast-
feedbacks, which is also true for most climate simulations by
