ing July for the 2050 A1B scenario due to a 5 % perturbation of
aircraft emissions (top), ship emissions (middle), and road trafﬁc
emissions (bottom). Solid white contour lines show the percentage
change relative to the BASE simulation while the dashed black line
indicates the tropopause. Note that different scales have been used
for each of the trafﬁc sectors and that the scales have been reversed
in order to show OH reductions, arising from a 5 % decrease in
emissions, as positive numbers.
