pendent CTMs driven with meteorology of the same period. In spite of some biases in absolute magnitude, 
the models are able to capture most of the observed variability of stratospheric N2O loss throughout the 
period. In SectionÂ 3, we follow the stratospheric loss of N2O and CFC-11 down to the surface, focusing on 
the long-term annually smoothed statistics that separate surface variability tied to the QBO from seasonal
