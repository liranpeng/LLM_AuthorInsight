in N2O below 15 hPa. It is possible that N2O is increasing
throughout the tropical stratosphere if the negative trend at
32 hPa is due to instrumental drift. Parallel analysis of the
MLS V4 N2O (not shown) shows a similar increase in the
trend from small negative trends at 32 hPa to large positive
ones at 3 hPa (not shown). At the upper end of our range
(2.2–6.8 hPa), Froidevaux et al. (2022, their Fig. 12) ﬁnd sim-
ilar trends in N2O to ours (∼13 %/decade) from MLS, ACE-
