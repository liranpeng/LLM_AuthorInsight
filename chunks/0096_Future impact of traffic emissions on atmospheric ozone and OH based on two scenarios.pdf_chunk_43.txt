results obtained for year 2000 (Hoor et al., 2009) and the op-
timistic emission scenario, B1, for AIR and SHIP (H2011).
Aircraft-induced O3 is mostly conﬁned to the NH UTLS (up-
per troposphere/lower stratosphere) region and is relatively
well-mixed zonally, while ship emissions have their largest
O3 impact in the lower troposphere and particularly over the
North Atlantic Ocean. Road trafﬁc emissions have their max-
imum effects on O3 over the Arabian Peninsula, but impacts
