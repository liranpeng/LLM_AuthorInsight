track following the longitude, latitude, and pressure given in
the observations. We average both model CO and ATom mea-
surements into one point per 360 s for easier visualization.
Figure 3. GEOS-5 simulated CO vs. QCLS CO observations for
all ATom-1 ﬂights averaged into 5 min bins. CO is in units of ppb.
Paciﬁc ﬂights are shown in red, Atlantic ﬂights in blue, N. Ameri-
can ﬂights in green, and Southern Ocean ﬂights in yellow. Circles
