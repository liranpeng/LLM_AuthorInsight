ing the Solar-J (and Cloud-J) band edge to 442 nm should be
investigated.
These differences, particularly the 412–442 nm interval,
explain most of the total budget difference where, overall,
Solar-J reﬂects 4 W m−2 (4 %) less back to space, absorbs
2 W m−2 (6 %) less in the stratosphere, 3 W m−2 (1 %) more
in the troposphere, and 3 W m−2 (1/2 %) more at the surface.
For SZAs of 21 and 62◦(Table 5), Solar-J continues to reﬂect
3–4 W m−2 less energy back to space, but at a large SZA of
