growth in the Northern Hemisphere and ice sheet decay in
Antarctica (Fig. 27a, Hansen et al., 2016), but the Northern
Hemisphere did not become cool enough to reestablish ice
sheets on North America or Eurasia. There was a small in-
crease in Greenland ice sheet mass (Larsen et al., 2015), but
this was presumably at least balanced by Antarctic ice sheet
mass loss (Lambeck et al., 2014).
The important point is that global temperature has risen
