order to be able to have a longitude-latitude visualization. Hence the standard deviation considered always corresponds to the
inherent one returned by the model and is not estimated by accounting for the temporal variance.
For the heat tendency, the longitude-latitude structure of the uncertainties returned by LF-RPN and MF-RPN follows
relatively well the MAE variation in longitude-latitude directions with higher values around the tropics for both metrics and also
