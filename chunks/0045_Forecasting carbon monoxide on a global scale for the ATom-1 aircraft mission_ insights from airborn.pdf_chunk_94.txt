and the MOPITT 200 hPa level (not shown) suggests CO
levels for 2016 were near the 75th percentile. In contrast,
MLS shows that 2016 CO in the upper troposphere was much
lower than average, near the 25th percentile. The MOPITT
v6 TIR product has a small positive bias drift in the upper
troposphere of 0.78 % yrâˆ’1 for the 200 hPa level (Deeter et
al., 2014), which may contribute to the higher rank of 2016
in the MOPITT upper-tropospheric data compared to MLS.
