(Prather, 1974; Wild et al., 2000) calculates mean specific intensities for the photolysis rates as well as flux 
divergence across each model layer. The cross sections used for atmospheric attenuation, photolysis rates, 
and absorption in bins #1–18 are photon-weighted. Heating rates use a reference solar table (Watts m−2) for 
each large bin. Atmospheric attenuation and absorption in IR bands #19–27 is calculated with the RRTMG
