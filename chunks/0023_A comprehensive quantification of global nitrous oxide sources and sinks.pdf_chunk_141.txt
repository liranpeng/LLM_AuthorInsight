is developed in ref. 72 for accounting for carbon flows due to land use. 
In this study, an observation dataset consisting of 18 tropical sites was 
collected to follow the book-keeping logic. The dataset covers N2O 
emissions from a reference mature forest and their nearby converted 
pastures aged between 1 and 60 years. The average tropical forest N2O 
emission rate of 1.974 kg N2O-N ha-1 yrâˆ’1 was adopted as the baseline73. 
Two logarithmic response curves of soil N2O emissions (normalized
