a minimum, integrating the vertical ﬂuxes across 100 hPa every time step with a lead time of 3 months to
cross-tropopause ﬂuxes is a more accurate proxy for the interannaul variability of STE than computing the
monthly mean vertical residual velocity at the same level. The full CCM simulations will implicitly include
the eﬀects of changing STE O3 ﬂux on tropospheric O3, but there are many factors inﬂuencing tropospheric
