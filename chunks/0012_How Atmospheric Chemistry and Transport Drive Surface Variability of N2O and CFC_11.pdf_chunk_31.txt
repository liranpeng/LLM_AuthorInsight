rates and O(1D) densities from the MLS profiles, providing the loss of N2O throughout the column. Solar cy-
cle variability in photolysis rates is not included in these calculations, but an estimate of photolysis changes 
is discussed in SectionÂ 2.4. N2O loss is calculated for each monthly profile and latitude bin from August 2004 
through December 2018. The seasonal pattern of N2O loss is matched very well by the CTMs (see P2015).
