Equation 1). Right: timeseries of global mean surface pressure due to dry air only (Equation 8).
normalized timestep-to-timestep differences a′
ff = aff(t + 1) −aff(t) (which is what we’d really
like to get right for each prognostic variable) vary strongly between variables. It is cumbersome to
change the loss function in FourCastNet to reflect this goal. As a pragmatic substitute, we modify the
normalization strategy to give equal contributions from tendency errors in each variable to the loss
