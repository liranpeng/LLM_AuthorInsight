for climate and climate–chemistry applications. In addition,
algorithmic considerations that may be important for com-
putational efﬁciency are reported on. The latter is inevitably
computing platform dependent.
The ensemble of results from a wide variety of schemes
presented here helps shed light on the ability of the test case
suite diagnostics and ﬂow settings to discriminate between
algorithms and provide insights into accuracy in the context
