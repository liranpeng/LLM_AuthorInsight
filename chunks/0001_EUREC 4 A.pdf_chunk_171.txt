by the Saildrones (Fig. 17). These measurements were co-
ordinated with the activities of the R/V Atalante and R/V
MS-Merian, as well as three underwater gliders (e.g., Fig. 4).
Extensive vertical proﬁling, also by high-speed underway
CTDs, aimed to quantify the impacts of submesoscale fronts
and ﬁlaments and mesoscale eddies on surface exchange pro-
cesses, and vice versa. Being able to resolve the thermal
