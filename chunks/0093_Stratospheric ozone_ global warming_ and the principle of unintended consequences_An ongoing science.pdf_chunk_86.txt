in manufacture of a refrigerant easily exceeds the climate
impact of the chemical refrigerant itself by more than an
order of magnitude. Furthermore, the other embodied energy
and indirect fuel use to power refrigeration and AC exceeds
the refrigerant impact by up to many orders of magnitude,
depending on the climate where the product is used and the
carbon intensity of the energy source.
