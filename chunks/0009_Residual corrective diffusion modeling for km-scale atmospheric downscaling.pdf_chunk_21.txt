the realism of power spectra for 10-meter kinetic energy (KE), 2-
meter temperature and synthesized vertical maximum of the
derived radar reflectivity (hereafter referred to as radar
reflectivity). Variance missing from the UNet is restored by the
corrective diffusion (blue-dashed vs blue-solid) – especially for the
radar reflectivity channel at all length scales (Fig. 1c), but also for
kinetic energy between 10–200 km length scales (Fig. 1a) and to a
