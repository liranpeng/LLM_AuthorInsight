UM-CAM and STOC-HadAM3. Since this region is not co-
located with major emissions, these increases in convection
have a very small inﬂuence on the CO-tracer distributions.
Increases in convective mass ﬂuxes are also simulated over
the east Paciﬁc portion of the ITCZ by GISS-E2-R and, to
a lesser extent, by the CMAM model (Figs. 8c–d and 9c–
d). Again, since this area of increase is over the ocean and
hence not co-located with emissions, there is little inﬂuence
