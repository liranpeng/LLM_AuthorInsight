Tropical cirrus clouds
For the cirrus cloud comparison, we use all three ice-water
parameterization options in RRTMG-SW and Solar-J’s sin-
gle parameterization. Figure 5a, b show the prescribed pro-
ﬁles of model input of IWC and re (Table 3). The cumula-
tive overhead τ at 600 nm is shown in Fig. 5c. The delta
scaling varies considerably across the RRTMG parameteri-
zations: Solar-J’s unscaled τ ∼0.43 compares with EC92’s
