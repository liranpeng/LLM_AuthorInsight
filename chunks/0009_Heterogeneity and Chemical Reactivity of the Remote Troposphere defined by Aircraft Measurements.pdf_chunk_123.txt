quent a fraction as to challenge the ability of current CTMs
to simulate these observations and thus be used to study the
oxidation budgets. In comparing ATom results with modeled
climatologies, we ﬁnd a clear model error – missing O3 pro-
duction over the tropical oceans’ lower troposphere – and
traced it to the lack of NOx below 4 km. The occurrence of
the same error over the central and eastern Paciﬁc as well as
the Atlantic Ocean makes this a robust model–measurement
discrepancy.
