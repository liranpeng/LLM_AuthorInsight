3.85 Âµm, which include a total of 21 sub-bins.  The edge of the IR transition is shifted 
from 778 to 700 nm and cross section in bin 18 are adjusted.  Only water vapor is 
included in the IR bands.  (Chou, 1992; Grant & Grossman, 1998).  
SJ/hrv 
SJ with high-resolution-visible version (SJ/hrv), putting 18 bands in the VIS region. 
SJ/2S 
SJ with 2-stream RT solver. 
SJ/66b 
SJ with a very high wavelength resolution in the IR used to resolve ice- and liquid-water
