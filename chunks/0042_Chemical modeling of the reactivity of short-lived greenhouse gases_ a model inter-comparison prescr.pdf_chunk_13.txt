tential causes of differences in model-simulated distributions
of chemical tracers are many. The numerical algorithms and
parameterizations for the transport, mixing, and thus disper-
sion of emissions is clearly one cause (Prather et al., 2008;
Lauritzen et al., 2014; Orbe et al., 2016); while photochemi-
cal mechanisms that produce and destroy species are another
(Olson et al., 1997; PhotoComp, 2010).
This paper initiates a new technique for multi-model com-
