its bias from short-term oscillations. Global warming be-
tween 1700 and 1800 as well as 1880 and 1920 was
∼0.1 ◦C (Abram et al., 2016; Hawkins et al., 2017; Mar-
cott et al., 2013), so 1750–2015 warming is ∼1.15 ◦C.
Taking climate sensitivity as 0.75 ◦C (W m−2)−1 forcing,
global warming of 1.15 ◦C implies that 1.55 W m−2 of the
total 2.5 W m−2 forcing has been “used up” to cause ob-
served warming. Thus, 0.95 W m−2 forcing should remain
to be responded to – i.e., the expected planetary energy
