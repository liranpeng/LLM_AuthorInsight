be used in estimating the lifetime. A high soil sink will be com-
pensated for by a large estimate of hydrogen emissions, as is
apparent in Fig. 1 for WACCM (73 Tg yr−1), which is outside the
range of bottom-up estimates (53.5–60 Tg yr−1) (Table 1 in
ref.

The

WACCM
(68.1 Tg yr−1) are far outside the range in Paulot et al.17 of 32.3

and
other

of
28–48 Tg yr−1 (Table 1 in17). On the other hand, UKCA has a
