Figure 4. Reactivities (ppb d−1) and J values (s−1) calculated for all 32 383 ATom-1 10 s parcels using 2 different days with different cloud
ﬁelds and ozone columns. The net integrated ozone change over the day, dO3/dt (ppb d−1), is also shown. Day 213 is 1 August, and day 223
is 11 August. Mean reactivity statistics here are calculated as the mean of ﬁve days (1, 6, 11, 16, and 21 August), while sensitivity analyses
used only day 223.
