STE does not apply to O3. Climatic variability in the modeled O3 ï¬‚ux needs to be diagnosed directly rather
than indirectly through the overturning circulation.
1. Introduction
The primary oxidant of the troposphere is O3. Its reaction with H2O generates hydroxyl radicals (OH) that
destroy pollutants and clean the lower atmosphere [Logan et al., 1981; Thompson, 1992]. Increases in
tropospheric O3 over the industrial era make it the third most important greenhouse gas after CO2 and CH4
