The enhancement is therefore at least partially aerosol-mediated, a conclusion that is supported by observations of droplet number at cloud base, which show a similar decline over the shipping lane. These results have fundamental implications for our understanding of aerosolâ€“cloud interactions, suggesting that deep convective clouds are impacted by the aerosol number distribution in the remote marine environment.
