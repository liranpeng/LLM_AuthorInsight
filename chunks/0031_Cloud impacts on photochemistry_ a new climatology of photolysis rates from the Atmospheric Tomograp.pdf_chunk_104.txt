graphic blocks and compare the sub-grid QCA CODs against
averaging approaches in Fig. 6. This histogram (blue dots) is
our best estimate of the distribution of total COD from a 1-D
nadir perspective of all the sub-grid ICAs. The UCI J values
are calculated as the average over four QCAs as representa-
tives of the ICAs. The two SCA models use simple averag-
ing (COD × CF, green dots) and B-averaging (COD × CF3/2,
