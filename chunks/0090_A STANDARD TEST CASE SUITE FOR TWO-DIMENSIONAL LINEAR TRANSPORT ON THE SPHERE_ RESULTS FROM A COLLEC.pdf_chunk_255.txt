a non-divergent ﬂow ﬁeld, the area of the sphere for which
the mixing ratio distribution is above a threshold value τ is
invariant. Measure ℓf quantiﬁes how much of the initial con-
dition area, for which the mixing ratio φ is larger than τ, is
preserved. By plotting ℓf as a function of τ, one can examine
how gradients are diffused or steepened and how uniform that
damping of gradients is. This test was found particularly use-
ful to identify how some ﬁlters, and limiters tend to perturb
