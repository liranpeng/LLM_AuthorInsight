RF components shift along the model ensemble’s major axis
of variability. Indeed past studies using complete removal
have on average predicted 10 % larger ship RF than stud-
ies with 5–30 % emission perturbations, so combined effects
of non-linearities and different perturbations might explain
up to half of the model ensemble spread. We note that the
RF components are insensitive to size of the ship NOx per-
turbation when assuming ﬁxed OPE. This demonstrates that
