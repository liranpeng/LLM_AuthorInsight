failed in mid-2013 and have since been replaced by the 190 GHz channel. The profiles for temperature and 
O3 use the same measurement channels as in P2015 but are derived from updated (version 4; V4) retrieval 
algorithms. After 2009, N2O values in the equatorial stratosphere show a drift of approximately −0.75%/
yr at the 68 hPa layer (see Froidevaux et al., 2019; Livesey et al., 2018). N2O loss is centered on the middle
