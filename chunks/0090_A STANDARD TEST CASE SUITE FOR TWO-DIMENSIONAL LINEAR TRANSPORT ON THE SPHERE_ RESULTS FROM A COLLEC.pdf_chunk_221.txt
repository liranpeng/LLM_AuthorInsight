actual values of ℓi for a particular scheme can be found in
the scatterplots (Figs. 11, 12, 13, and 14). Schemes with no
data are listed with ℓi = −1. Note that the spread among the
schemes for ℓi/ℓ(un)
i
(CSLAM) spans a large range (for ex-
ample, at 1.5◦the total mixing is more than 20 times the
CSLAM reference mixing).
To show the large amount of data concisely, the histograms
are stacked so that the total height of each rectangle is total
normalized mixing,
