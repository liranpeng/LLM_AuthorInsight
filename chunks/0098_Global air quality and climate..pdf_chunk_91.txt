spatial scales, Doherty et al.232 ﬁnd little response of inter-
continental transport pathways themselves to a warming
climate, but note enhanced sensitivity of O3 to emissions
within the source region (reﬂecting isoprene increases and
thermally driven decomposition of peroxy acetyl nitrate which
could otherwise export NOx downwind) and decreased sensi-
