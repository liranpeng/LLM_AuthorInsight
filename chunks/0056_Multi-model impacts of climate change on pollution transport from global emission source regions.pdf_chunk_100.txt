an increase in tropopause height in modulating CO-tracer
concentrations by comparing annual-mean proﬁles of the
CO tracer, plotted relative to the thermal tropopause, for
both present-day and future periods (Fig. 11). Comparison
of annual-mean CO-tracer proﬁles reveals that when vertical
CO-tracer proﬁles are compared in tropopause relative coor-
dinates there is generally less difference between present day
and future, unlike when the CO-tracer proﬁles are plotted rel-
