increased CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ concentration. The simulated warming from an SST increase is weakly amplified relative to the surface through the mid‐troposphere before increasing to a factor of about 2.5 in the upper troposphere. This combination of muted warming in the mid‐troposphere and amplified warming aloft is within the range of CMIP6 models at individual pressure levels but, taken together, is distinctive behavior. The response to CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ increase with unchanged SST is an
