contributions from speciﬁc source sectors to CH4 emissions,60
the underlying factors contributing to recent observed trends
(e.g., ref. 61–63), and in feedbacks from the biosphere.13
Although these uncertainties limit conﬁdence in accurately
projecting the future evolution of CH4, it is clear that decreasing
atmospheric CH4 would slow near-term warming, due to its
stronger climate impact on the 20 year (versus 100 year) time
frame, which could help to slow Arctic sea ice loss over
