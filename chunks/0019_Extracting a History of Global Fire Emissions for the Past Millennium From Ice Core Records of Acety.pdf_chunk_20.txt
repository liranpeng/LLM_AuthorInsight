possible, but debated source (Dyonisius et al., 2020; Etiope & Ciccioli, 2009; Hmiel et al., 2020; Petrenko
et al., 2017). CO has preindustrial sources from biomass burning and from atmospheric oxidation of
methane and nonmethane hydrocarbons. To obtain a history of biomass burning from ice core CO and
CH4, co‚Äêmeasurements of the stable isotopic composition of CH4 and CO are required to partition the biomass
