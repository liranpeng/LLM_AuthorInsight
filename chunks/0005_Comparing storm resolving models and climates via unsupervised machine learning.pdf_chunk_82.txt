TLS across all layers to get a composite value for the vertical velocity field. We then calculate the power spectrum 
of the weighted average length of all samples, using ϕ to represent the power spectra, ||k|| as the complex modulus, 
n as the number of dimensions, and ⟨⟩ as the vertical integral:
