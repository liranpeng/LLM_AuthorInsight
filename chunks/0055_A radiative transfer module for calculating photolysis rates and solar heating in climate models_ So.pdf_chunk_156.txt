tecture) tuning of ∼50 times more relative to the CPU time
if a large number of column atmospheres (200+) were con-
currently evaluated (Artico et al., 2015). Another effort used
a ﬁeld-programmable gate array (FPGA) with the advantage
that it applies to a single column calculation. The FPGA re-
sulted in a ∼4 times greater speedup and a rather dramatic
35 times more energy savings compared to the multicore pro-
cessor computation (Rezaei et al., 2016). Fast-J was also op-
