quantities at the midpoint of the corresponding edge to get a
second-order spatial approximation at time t.
The semi-discrete Eq. (A14) is then marched forward in
time using the Rungeâ€“Kutta third-order total variational di-
minishing time integration scheme. This choice of time inte-
gration helps to damp the unphysical oscillation due to time
discretization.

To evaluate the right-hand side of Eqs. (A13) and (A14), we
