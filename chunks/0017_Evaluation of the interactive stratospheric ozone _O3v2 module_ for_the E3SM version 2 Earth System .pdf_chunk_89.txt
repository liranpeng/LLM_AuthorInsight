diagnostic (Figs. 10 and 11), we compute the uncentered
RMSE relative to observations for the E3SM models and
30 CMIP5 AMIP models with the PCMDI Metrics Package
(PMP) (Gleckler et al., 2016). The E3SM simulations cover
the period of 1995–2014, while the CMIP5 ensemble cov-
ers the years 1981–2005. The spatial RMSE of the annual
and four seasonal averages for nine variables are presented
as boxes and whiskers for the CMIP5 ensemble, blue dots
