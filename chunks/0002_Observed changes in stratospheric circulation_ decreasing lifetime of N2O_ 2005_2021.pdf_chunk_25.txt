by itself would reduce the loss.
The declining J-N2O is primarily due to the recovery of
overhead ozone during this period from reduced chlorine-
catalyzed depletion as the CFCs and other chlorinated gases
have declined following the Montreal Protocol agreement
that regulated these source gases (Bernath et al., 2020;
Froidevaux et al., 2022, and references therein). Obser-
vations show continued increases in upper tropical strato-
spheric ozone for 2000â€“2020 (Godin-Beekmann et al., 2022)
