(based on the ratio of anthropogenic to total nitrogen additions from 
land) to calculate anthropogenic emissions. Seagrass, mangrove, salt-
marsh and intertidal N2O emissions were undated and obtained from 
ref. 68. Coastal waters with low disturbance generally either have low 
N2O emissions or act as a sink for N2O69,70. Here, coastal zone emissions 
were treated as anthropogenic emissions owing to intensive human 
disturbances71.
