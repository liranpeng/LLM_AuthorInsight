made efforts to assimilate aerosols in the models. These
efforts are mainly focused on assimilating satellite data,
usually aerosol optical depth (AOD), since satellites pro-
vide continuous aerosol observations on the global scale
and yield a large number of individual observations, which
is desirable for assimilation systems. Many studies have
used variational data assimilation techniques. For exam-
ple, a 3-D-VAR system for assimilating AOD data was
