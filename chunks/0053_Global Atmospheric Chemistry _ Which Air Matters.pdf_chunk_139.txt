gitude slice as in ATom, then will these be so clearly deﬁned?
We examine this representativeness test by subsampling two
models (C: GFDL-AM3 and F: UCI-CTM) at longitudes of
150, 165, 180, 195, and 210◦E in Fig. 8 to compare with the
average over the mid-Paciﬁc domain. The densities are renor-
malized and show similar peaks and patterns, but of course
there is more pixel-level noise and some differences. The
transect at 150◦E is clearly less representative of the mid-
