As highlighted by Bodenschatz et al. (2010), the range of
scales, from micro- to megameters, that clouds encompass
has long been one of their fascinating aspects. Measurements
made during EUREC4A quantiﬁed, for the ﬁrst time, the
main processes that inﬂuence trade wind clouds across this
full range of scales. By doing so, long-standing questions in
cloud physics were addressed, including (i) whether micro-
physical processes substantially inﬂuence the net amount of
