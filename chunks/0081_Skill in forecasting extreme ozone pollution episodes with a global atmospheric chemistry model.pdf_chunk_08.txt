rent global chemistry models are known to have high biases
in their production of global tropospheric ozone from pollu-
tion (Wild and Prather, 2006). This high bias in production
extends to surface ozone on a continental scale (e.g., Nolte
et al., 2008; Appel et al., 2012; Lamarque et al., 2012; Ras-
mussen et al., 2012), although in one case the bias is negli-
gible (Mao et al., 2013). These chemistry-transport models
(CTMs) or CCMs also have serious limitations in modeling
