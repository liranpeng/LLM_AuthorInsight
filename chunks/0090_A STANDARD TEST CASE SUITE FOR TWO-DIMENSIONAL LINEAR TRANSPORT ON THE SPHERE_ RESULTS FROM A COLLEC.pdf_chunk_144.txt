ations at n + 1/2 were used in the simulations), so, as for
CSLAM, the temporal errors due to “trajectories” can be ex-
pected to be small. In conclusion, the absolute errors for the
two-time-level CAM-FV solutions are dominated by spatial
errors (number of ﬂux evaluations increases with decreased
CN).

“Minimal” resolution 1λm: cosine bells
Rather than assessing convergence rates, this test focuses on
absolute errors. In other words, we ask at what resolution
