located in the tropical boundary layer.
For the southern hemisphere the models calculate the
strongest absolute effect on the ozone mixing ratio also for
the upper troposphere, although the changes relative to the
unperturbed case maximize in the marine boundary layer. In
the southern hemisphere, both, absolute and relative changes
are about 50% lower than in the northern hemisphere. The
effect on ozone in the southern boundary layer is only about
2 ppbv during January and July.
