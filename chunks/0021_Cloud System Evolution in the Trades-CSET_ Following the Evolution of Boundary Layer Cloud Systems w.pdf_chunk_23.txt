results provide an important baseline for comparing the microphysical and macrophysical 
structure of the stratocumulus clouds sampled during CSET.
VOCALS did not extend into the trade-wind cumulus regime downwind of the main Sc 
deck. Much of the early observational work on small cumuli in the trade wind boundary 
layer was conducted using in situ aircraft observations. But there are inherent limitations to
