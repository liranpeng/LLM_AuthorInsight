istry (Fig. 2). MOE is low in the young plume because of
rapid NOx loss, despite high OH concentrations in the plume
that can be double the ambient values (Chen et al., 2005;
Song et al., 2003). The NOx lifetime and MOE increase in
the grid-scale chemistry, so that the total MOE is 3.1 with
parametric plume chemistry. The instant dilution assumption
raises the overall MOE to 4.4, while in the Ô¨Åxed OPE simula-
tion, the MOE is only 1.2 because the direct chemical effects
