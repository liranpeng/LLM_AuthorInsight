tently close, within a factor of 2 of this limit. For L-O3 and
L-CH4, any pair of GSFC-GC-UCI fall within this range,
while GFDL, GISS and NCAR are a factor of 5–10 above
it. For the two CCMs this is likely caused by their use of
different T and q’s, while for GISS it probably lies in the
chemical model. For P -O3, only the pair GC-UCI is within a
factor of 2, but GFDL-GSFC-GC-UCI form a distinct cluster.
