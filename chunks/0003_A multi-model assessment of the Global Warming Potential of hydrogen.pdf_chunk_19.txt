total lifetime is calculated by the burden divided by the soil sink
(as diagnosed in the models) and atmospheric loss, which is equal
to the total loss, as it will be in steady state.
Atmospheric composition changes. To investigate the impact of
hydrogen on the atmospheric composition, we have perturbed the
models (relative to 2010 levels) with a 10% increase in hydrogen
surface concentrations (PERT_H2). Because methane is also Ô¨Åxed
at the surface we perform an additional experiment, a 10%
