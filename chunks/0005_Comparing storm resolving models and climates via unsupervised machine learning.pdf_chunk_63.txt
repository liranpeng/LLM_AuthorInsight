potentially less susceptible to human biases. For example, we could independently reproduce known types of 
tropical convection verified through examination of the geographic domain and vertical structure. At the same 
time, our machine learning methods facilitate an intuitive understanding of simulation differences.
Our distributional comparisons identify consistency in only six of the nine considered storm resolving
