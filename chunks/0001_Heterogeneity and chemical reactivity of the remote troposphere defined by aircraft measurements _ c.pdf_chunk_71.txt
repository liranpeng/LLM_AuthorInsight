These six-model version 0 statistics are shown alongside
the version 2b results using the current UCIZ model but with
a new protocol designated RDS*. While investigating sen-
sitivities in the RDS, we found an inconsistency between
the reported concentrations of both pernitric acid (HNO4)
and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) with respect to the chemical
kinetics used in the models. High concentrations (100 ppt,
