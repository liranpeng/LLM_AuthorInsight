eterization studies of atmospheric ESM parameterization30,
here we propose a multi-fidelity RPN model (MF-RPN) as a
parameterization scheme for atmospheric convection (deep
clouds), which is the first of its kind to the best of our knowl-
edge. The MF-RPN surrogate model is designed to take into
account the distribution shift across regimes leveraging the
rich LF training data regimes while refining it with higher
accuracy but more limited HF regimes. This proves crucial to
