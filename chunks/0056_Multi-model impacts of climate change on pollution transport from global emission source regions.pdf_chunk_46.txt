averaged thermal tropopause. Bottom panels: differences between 2090–2099 (RCP 8.5) and 1995–2006 (present day) DJF climatological
mean zonal-mean CO distributions. Thin black contours denote the present-day DJF climatology. The thick solid and dashed lines represent
the DJF zonally averaged thermal tropopause for present-day and the 2090s (RCP 8.5) climatologies. Grey shading indicates where results
