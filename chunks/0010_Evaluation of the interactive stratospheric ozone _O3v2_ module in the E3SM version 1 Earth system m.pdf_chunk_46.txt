back to tropical levels by 60◦. The SD and SCO provide a test
of the interannual variability in the stratospheric circulation.
All simulations overestimate the SD of anomalies near the
Equator, while ﬂuctuating around the observation over the
extratropics, especially in the Northern Hemisphere (NH).
UCI CTM greatly (20 %) overestimates SD in the tropics
and is consistently higher at all latitudes. Both EAM versions
match well in the tropics and northern latitudes but underes-
