essentially considered time as another dimension in space
(i.e., 1â—¦= 1 day), and (2) geographic distance between two
grid cells varies with latitude and is not accounted for in the
clustering. We consider the former to be of no consequence
since a time separation cutoff of less than 1 day is not possi-
ble using daily MDA8 values to identify AQX events. Also,
a larger cutoff value would be unfavorable since events could
be statistically linked even if they occurred at the same grid
