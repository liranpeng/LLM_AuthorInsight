the sites tend to be located near one another. Thus QP is a
measure of error in interpolation.
Deriving an error for the interpolated grid-cell-average
values is more difﬁcult since we have no objective measure of
the cell-averaged ozone values. Clearly the minimum RMSE
of 6 ppb for individual sites is an exaggeration of the error
when averaging over a 1◦grid cell (∼104 km2). Using the
error analysis done for the sites (removing randomly 10 %
