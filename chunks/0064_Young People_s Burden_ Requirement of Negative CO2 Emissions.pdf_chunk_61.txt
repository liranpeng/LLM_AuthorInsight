is ice sheet melt and consequent signiﬁcant sea level rise, as
occurred in the Eemian, but there are other risks in pushing
the climate system far out of its Holocene range. Methane
release from thawing permafrost and methane hydrates is an-
other potential feedback, for example, but the magnitude and
