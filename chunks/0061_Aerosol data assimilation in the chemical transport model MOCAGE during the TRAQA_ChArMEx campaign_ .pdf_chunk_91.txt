sity underestimated by the direct model run. The stations in
the east, like in Lampedusa and Cyprus, were not inﬂuenced
by these dust events. They are mostly inﬂuenced by sea salt
aerosols, and the data assimilation also has a positive im-
pact here. The assimilation model run, with only two MODIS
overpasses per day, also shows improved hourly variations of
AOD in these stations. These variations are not clearly visi-
ble in the model direct run, but they are present in AERONET
