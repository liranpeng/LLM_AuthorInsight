with 20 % reduction (20 % fewer points than on a regular
latitude–longitude grid with the same resolution at the Equa-
tor). The grids are constructed with the algorithm of Fadeev
(2013). The grid reduction starts from approximately 45◦N/S
(see Tolstykh and Shashkin, 2012, for grid statistics and
pictures). Semi-analytical trajectories (Nair and Lauritzen,
2010) are used. For the 1.5◦and 0.75◦resolutions, a non-
dimensional time step of T/110 and T/220, respectively, is
