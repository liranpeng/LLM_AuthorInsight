ﬂuxes across e90-tropopause. Color scheme is same as in Figure 1f. Twelve month running mean of normalized NH
ozone ﬂuxes across several isosurfaces for (h) C29 and (i) C36. Fluxes across the e90-tropopause are plotted in black;
across 250-O3 surface in red; in solid lines for TC method and dashed lines for LS method. Estimation by the vertical
