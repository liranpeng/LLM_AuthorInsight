et al., 2019; and Caldwell et al., 2019). Globally, the O3v2
and O3v1 climate are almost identical. Over the SH high-
latitudes, however, the changes are greater for some climate
variables connected with the ozone hole changes. In terms
of climate sensitivity, the good news is that the O3v2 ver-
sion is within 2 % of the original O3v1, whereas alternate
E3SMv1 conﬁgurations with increased resolution or physi-
cal tunings show distinctly different (6 %–12 %) climate sen-
