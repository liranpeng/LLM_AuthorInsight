dent in both the observations and model. Figure 3 also re-
veals occasional model overestimates of CO on ﬂights over
North America (green triangles), as well as underestimates of
high-CO plumes over the North Paciﬁc and tropical Atlantic.
An underestimate of Eurasian biomass burning contributes to
the model underestimates in the North Paciﬁc and North At-
lantic, and has implications for ozone production in aged BB
plumes. Globally, the correlation of simulated and observed
