air from polluted urban areas. Although the perturbation sig-
nal from E39/C is largest compared to the other models, the
ensemble mean response of the models is still larger than
the interannual variability of the transport induced ozone
changes according to E39/C. Thus, focusing on a particular
year is justiÔ¨Åed within a 10% uncertainty for ozone since this
is the climatological variability simulated consistently within
one model.
