col allows us to go further and derive the sensitivity fac-
tors (S = dln(R)/dln(X)) relative to the chemical species (X).
From these sensitivities, we can identify the critical species
where model error in their atmospheric simulation will cause
large errors in the budgets. This information is useful in di-
recting modelâ€“measurement comparisons. From the sensitiv-
ities, we have also derived correctly linearized lifetimes and
even the CH4 chemical feedback. Admittedly these are only
