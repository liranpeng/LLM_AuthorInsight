ﬁcient use of fertilizers could reduce N2O emissions (Liu
and Zhang, 2011), but considering the scale of global agri-
culture, and the fact that ﬁxed N is an inherent part of feed-
ing people, there will be pressure for continued emissions at
least comparable to present emissions. In contrast, agricul-
tural CH4 emissions are inadvertent and not core to food pro-
duction. Given the current imbalance (emissions exceeding
atmospheric losses by about 30 %; Prather et al., 2012) and
