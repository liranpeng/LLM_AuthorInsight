number of cells can be computed from
nc = 20n2 4k.
The average resolution at the Equator was computed as
follows:
1λave = 360◦1x
2π re
,
where 1x is the average distance between neighboring cell
centers and re is the earth radius. In Table A2 the applied
grids are listed together with their effective resolutions and
applied time steps. The wind vector used to deﬁne the swept
ﬂux areas is computed by evaluating the analytical wind vec-
tor at the center of the cell side at time n + 1/2.
