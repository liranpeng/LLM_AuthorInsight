little evidence that the radiative lofting of cold point cirrus substantially influences the cold point. Cold point‐overshooting convection alone cannot explain all variations in the cold point across different GSRMs or regions; future studies using longer GSRM simulations that consider longer‐term UTLS processes are needed to fully understand what sets the cold point.
