O3 mixing ratio due to SHIP in the planetary boundary layer
(PBL) is much lower than that due to AIR in the UTLS. The
reason is that near the surface where the SHIP emissions take
place, reservoir species of NOx, such as HNO3 and PAN, are
more rapidly removed by wet scavenging and dry deposition
than in the UTLS (Hoor et al., 2009). In addition, model re-
sults show that concentrations of HO2 increase with decreas-
ing altitude, leading to a shorter lifetime of ozone produced
