dust or sea salt are primary contributors to the uncertainty
in present-day aerosol forcing (Carslaw et al., 2013). This
is because the response of the climate system to human-
induced aerosol perturbations depends critically on the nat-
ural aerosol background (Carlton et al., 2010; Gordon et al.,
2016), due in part to the non-linear response of aerosolâ€“cloud
interactions.
The forcing of climate by ozone changes has resulted
from increases in ozone driven by changes in nitric oxides
