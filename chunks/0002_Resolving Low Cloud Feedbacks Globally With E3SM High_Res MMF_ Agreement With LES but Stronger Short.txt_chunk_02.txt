This study investigates low cloud feedback in a warmer climate using global simulations from the High‐Resolution Multi‐scale Modeling Framework (HR‐MMF), which explicitly simulates small‐scale eddies globally. Two 5‐year simulations—one with present‐day sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and a second with SSTs warmed uniformly by 4 K—reveal a positive global shortwave cloud radiative effect (SWCRE = 0.3 W/ m2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{2}$ /K), comparable to estimates from CMIP models. As the climate warms,
