to the tropical boundary of the LMS, (ii) the net photochemical source within the LMS region, and (iii) the
change in the daily averaged LMS O3 mass through the month, e.g., LS-e90= wO3LMS@100hPa + (P −L)LMS−
dM∕dtLMS.
For TC the O3 STE is calculated based on the change in tropospheric O3 content after each tracer transport
step using an isosurface (e90, 120 ppb-O3, 250 ppb-O3) to mark the tropopause. This method is developed
