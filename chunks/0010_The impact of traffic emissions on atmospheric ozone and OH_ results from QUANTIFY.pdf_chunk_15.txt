crease of OH from anthropogenic CO, NOx and non-methane
hydrocarbons (NMHCs) (Dalsoren and Isaksen, 2006). In
addition, the regional OH distribution can be differ substan-
tially due to the short lifetime of OH and NOx in particular
in the lower troposphere and the different response of the
HOx-NOx-O3-system to NOx perturbations (Lelieveld et al.,
2002, 2004).
Although generally the presence of carbon
compounds such as CH4, NMHCs, and CO act as a sink for
