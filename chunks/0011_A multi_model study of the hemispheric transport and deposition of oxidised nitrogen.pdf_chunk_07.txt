on carbon uptake by vegetation. The latitudinal distributions
and proportions of NOy deposited to land varied consider-
ably between the models. Lamarque et al. [2005] used
results from six models to investigate changes in the
deposition of NOy between the years 2000 and 2100, using
the IPCC SRES A2 scenario. They found significant
increases in the future deposition fluxes, driven by greater
emissions. The impact of climate change on regional
