its importance in the seasonal isotopic signals (Liang et al.,
2017; Koren et al., 2019; Laskar et al., 2019).
Both models and observations have shown that the strato-
spheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) modulates the STE
and drives much of the IAV observed in surface N2O through
the stratospheric inï¬‚ux of N2O-depleted air (Hamilton and
