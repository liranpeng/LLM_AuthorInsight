UCISOM-CN5.5, which has at least one order of magni-
tude less real mixing and unmixing compared to schemes
with similar “minimal” resolution. Another “outlier” is the
unlimited HOMME-p6-CN0.13, which has higher levels of
ℓr and ℓu than schemes with similar “minimal” resolutions,
which is due to spurious grid-scale oscillations. HEL, like
UCISOM, is an outlier, and it clearly shows that HEL was
speciﬁcally designed to minimize numerical mixing as the
