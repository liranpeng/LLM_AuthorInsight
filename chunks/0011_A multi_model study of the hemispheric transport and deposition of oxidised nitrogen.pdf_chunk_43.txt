same year being used. Some very recent work suggests that
the formation of HNO3 from the reaction between HO2 and
NO may have a significant impact on modelled NOy
concentrations, and hence deposition fluxes [Cariolle et
al., 2008].
[19] The simulations used were only 1 year long, and so
the influence of interannual variability on the derived
source-receptor relationships via changes in the transport
pathways cannot be assessed. Further experiments are
