more complete with respect to N2O and BC, but these topics
were considered too far afield from the core topics. Unless action
is taken under the Montreal, Kyoto, or other protocols, N2O from
unnatural sources will soon be the largest ODS to the atmo-
sphereâ€”given that other sources are phased out from production
and slowly eliminated by atmospheric processes. Like methyl
bromide, N2O has natural sources that are likely uncontrollable,
but a phase-out of manufactured N2O is important.
