NOx into the CTM grid, at the rate speciÔ¨Åed by the
emission inventory, as done in previous studies with
other models.
2. Fixed OPE. We assume that sub-grid chemistry converts
each mole of ship NOx to 10 moles of O3 and 1 mole of
HNO3.
3. Parametric plume chemistry. This is our best represen-
tation of sub-grid plume chemistry using the look-up
tables described above.
