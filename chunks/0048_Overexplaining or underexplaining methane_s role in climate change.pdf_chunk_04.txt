contained in present observations, as well as their limits.
Both Rigby et al. and Turner et al. suggest that

from the 1990s through the 2000s and that this loss
process was mainly responsible for the brief plateau in
global mean methane. In contrast, most past work
pointed to stable emissions as the cause of the plateau.
The new papers differ, however, on what explains the
