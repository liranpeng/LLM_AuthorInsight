0.1 W m2)10 and substantial increases in O3
RF are estimated for the next century with the SRES scenarios.26
Emissions of O3 precursors, particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx)
and volatile organic compounds (VOC) also produce secondary
aerosols and thereby a negative climate forcing, though this
aerosol RF is poorly quantiﬁed relative to the O3 RF.27 We
discuss below the role of speciﬁc O3 precursor emissions, with a
strong emphasis on the role of CH4, which has received growing
