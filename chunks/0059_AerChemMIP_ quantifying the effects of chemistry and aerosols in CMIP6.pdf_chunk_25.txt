tercomparison of 3-D chemistry transport models (OxComp
in Prather et al., 2001; Gauss et al., 2003) provided informa-
tion on the geographical distribution of ozone forcing for the
IPCC Third Assessment Report (Ramaswamy et al., 2001).
The IPCC Fourth Assessment report (AR4) (Forster et al.,
2007) again used a multi-model framework (Atmospheric
Composition Change European Network â€“ ACCENT) to cal-
culate maps of ozone radiative forcing (Gauss et al., 2006).
