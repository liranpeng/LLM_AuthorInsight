ferences in global τCH4×OH anomalies between networks can
partially be explained by small discrepancies (∼0.1 ppt) in
the monthly mean methyl chloroform concentrations at col-
located measurement sites.
We quantitatively explain τCH4×OH variability in the
CTMs with 5 climate and emission variables: air temper-
ature, water vapor, ozone column, biomass burning emis-
sions, and lightning NOx emissions. A parametric model
built on these 5 factors reproduces 90 % of the variability
