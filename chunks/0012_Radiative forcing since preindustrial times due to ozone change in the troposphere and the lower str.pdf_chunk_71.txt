in other publications of the respective model groups in the
scientiÔ¨Åc literature. Year 2000 concentrations of N2O, CH4,
and CO2 were chosen by the modelers. For the 1850 simu-
lations, all anthropogenic emissions of NOx, CH4, CO, and
NMHCs were switched off. Biomass burning emissions were
reduced by 90%, a common assumption also used in ear-
lier experiments (Mickley et al., 1999; Shindell et al., 2003;
