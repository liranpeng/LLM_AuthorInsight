their limitations, thus clarifying the urgency of government
actions to rapidly advance the transition to carbon-free ener-
gies to meet the climate stabilization targets they have set.
We ﬁrst describe the status of global temperature change
and then summarize the principal climate forcings that drive
long-term climate change. We show that observed global
warming is consistent with knowledge of changing climate
forcings, Earth’s measured energy imbalance, and the canon-
