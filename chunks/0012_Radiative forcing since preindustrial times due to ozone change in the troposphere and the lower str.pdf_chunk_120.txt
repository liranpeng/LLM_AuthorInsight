chemistry (ULAQ, DLR E39C, and NCAR MACCM) and
CHASER show increases in stratospheric ozone except in the
tropical lower stratosphere, where reductions occur. For ex-
ample, the DLR E39C model simulates a 5% decrease of the
tropical ozone destruction at about 24 km altitude as a direct
consequence of the temperature decrease shown in Fig. 4,
which leads to enhanced ozone mixing ratios. The model
also simulates an increase in the annual mean tropical mass
