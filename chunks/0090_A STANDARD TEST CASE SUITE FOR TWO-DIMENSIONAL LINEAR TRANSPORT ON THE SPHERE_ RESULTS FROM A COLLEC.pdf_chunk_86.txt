into one-dimensional “sweeps” (one sweep along a coordi-
nate axis and one sweep along the upstream translation of the
other coordinate axis); such schemes are referred to as cas-
cade schemes and were originally introduced by Purser and
Leslie (1991) for non-conservative semi-Lagrangian interpo-
lation. Later, conservative versions of the cascade method
were proposed, e.g., the conservative cascade scheme (CCS;
Nair et al., 2002). In each cascade sweep, PPM-based opera-
