The atmospheric chemistry of tropospheric OH and
methane involves nonlinear chemistry that could, in princi-
ple, undermine the additivity of terms in Eq. (3). We test the
linearity of the system with a ﬁnal perturbation test in the
UCI CTM in which all 5 factors are perturbed simultane-
ously. The resulting change in τCH4×OH differs by about 1
part in 10 from the linear addition of factors.
The CTM simulations in this work make several assump-
