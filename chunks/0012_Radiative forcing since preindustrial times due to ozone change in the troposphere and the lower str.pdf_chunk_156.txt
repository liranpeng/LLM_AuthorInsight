and discussed in this and the previous section are summa-
rized as global-mean values in Fig. 8. Both the LW and SW
tropospheric forcings are positive, consistent with the tropo-
spheric ozone column increase calculated by all models. The
LW and SW forcings connected with the stratospheric ozone
column reduction have opposite signs. For some models the
negative LW contribution dominates, while in other models
the positive SW contribution is larger. While the net tropo-
