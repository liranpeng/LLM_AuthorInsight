FARSIGHT and SBC) reduced “optimal” convergence rates.
The effect of shape-preserving ﬁlters on the “minimal” res-
olution seems to go both ways (Fig. 3, top). That is, some
schemes increase accuracy (1λm increases) when the shape-
preserving ﬁlter is used (most notably with MPAS, ICON,
SBC, CLAW), whereas other schemes experience a de-
crease (HOMME-p3, HOMME-p6, CSLAM). It is noted that
ICON/MPAS and CLAW use FCT and TVD-type ﬂux lim-
iters, whereas CSLAM uses a slope limiter. Results that
