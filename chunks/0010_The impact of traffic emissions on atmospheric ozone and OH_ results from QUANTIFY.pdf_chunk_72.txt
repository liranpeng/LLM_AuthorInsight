emissions occur over a relatively large area. Over the eastern
US and western Europe the sum of all three emission cate-
gories reach a maximum. Their combination is responsible
for the relatively strong perturbations in these regions.
To assess the robustness of the perturbation signal two
tests are performed. First the model to model differences in
terms of the associated standard deviation is assessed to esti-
mate the impact of model uncertainties. Second, the impact
