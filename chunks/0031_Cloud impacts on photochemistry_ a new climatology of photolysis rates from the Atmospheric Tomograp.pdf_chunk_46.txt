A quick look at J-cloudy (all sky) proﬁles of J-O1D
and J-NO2 for CAFS (Fig. S2) shows a basic pattern also
seen in models. Both Js are larger in the upper troposphere
where the direct sunlight is more intense, but in the North
Paciﬁc, larger cloud cover and more scattered light almost
reverses this pattern with enhanced Js at lower altitudes
(> 600 hPa). Comparing the variances of J-cloudy (CAFS)
