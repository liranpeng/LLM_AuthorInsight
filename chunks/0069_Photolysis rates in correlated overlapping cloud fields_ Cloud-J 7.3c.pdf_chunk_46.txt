each FCA and then averaged. The number of ICAs per FCA
averages 169 for model G6, 21 for model G3, and 19 for
model G0; see Fig. 2 for the probability distribution of ICA
numbers. Errors are pressure weighted and include the aver-
age error over 0–1 km altitude, the root mean square (rms)
error over 0–1 km, and the full tropospheric rms error (0–
16 km). The average 0–1 km differences across the models
are small (< 2 %), but the rms 0–1 and 0–16 km differences
