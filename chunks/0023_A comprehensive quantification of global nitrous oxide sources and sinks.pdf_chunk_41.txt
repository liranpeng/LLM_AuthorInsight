son Project16, natural soil emissions dominate (to different extents) in 
tropical and sub-tropical regions. Soil N2O emissions in the tropics 
(0.1 ± 0.04 g N m−2 yr−1) are about 50% higher than the global average, 
because many lowland, highly weathered tropical soils have excess 
nitrogen relative to phosphorus20. Total anthropogenic emissions in 
the 10 terrestrial regions (Fig. 2) were highest in East Asia (1.5 (0.8–2.6)
