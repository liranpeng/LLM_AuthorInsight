DYAMOND5 project (Stevens et al., 2019c) â€“ the capabil-
ity of performing kilometer-scale simulations on global (at-
mospheric) grids (Satoh et al., 2019). A follow-up, called
DYAMOND-Winter, is extending this capability to also in-
clude coupled global models and has been coordinated to
simulate the EUREC4A period. DYAMOND-Winter simula-
tions are being initialized from observational analyses on 20
January and run for at least 40 d. With grid scales of a few
