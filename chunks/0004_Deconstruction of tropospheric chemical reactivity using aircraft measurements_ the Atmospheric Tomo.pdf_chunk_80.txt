Overall, these ﬁgures (Figs. 6–25) show the dominance of
the tropics (30◦S–30◦N) for photochemical reactivity over
the oceans. Only the northern mid-latitudes (30–60◦N) al-
most contribute a ﬁfth tropic-like reactive region in summer
(ATom-14), especially in the Atlantic.
Curtain proﬁles for the Arctic are presented only for
ATom-1 (Fig. 26) and ATom-4 (Fig. 27) when there was
enough sunlight to generate non-negligible reactivities. The
