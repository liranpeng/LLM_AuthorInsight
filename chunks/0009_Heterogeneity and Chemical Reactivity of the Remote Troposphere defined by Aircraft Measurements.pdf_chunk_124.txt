Building our chemical statistics (PDs) from the ATom 10 s
air parcels on a scale of 2 km by 80 m, we can identify the
fundamental scales of spatial heterogeneity in tropospheric
chemistry. Although heterogeneity occurs at the ﬁnest scales
(such as seen in some 1 s observations), the majority of vari-
ability in terms of the O3 and CH4 budgets occurs across
scales larger than neighboring 2 km parcels. The PDs mea-
sured in ATom can be largely captured by global models’
