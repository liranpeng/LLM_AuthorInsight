mates of the chemical impact and radiative forcing (RF) of
ship NOx have generally assumed that plumes of ship ex-
haust are instantly diluted into model grid cells spanning
hundreds of kilometers, even though this is known to produce
biased results. Here we improve the parametric representa-
tion of exhaust-gas chemistry developed in the GEOS-Chem
chemical transport model (CTM) to provide the Ô¨Årst estimate
of RF from shipping that accounts for sub-grid-scale ship
