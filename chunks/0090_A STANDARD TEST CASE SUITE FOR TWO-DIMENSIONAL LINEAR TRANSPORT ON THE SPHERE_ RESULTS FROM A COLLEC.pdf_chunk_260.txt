able (overshooting unmixing should be exactly zero; range-
preserving unmixing should decrease) and how much real
mixing the ﬁlter introduces.

Ability of transport scheme to deal with divergent
ﬂows
To force the modeler to consider density of air and tracer
mass coupling (at least for ﬁnite-volume type schemes), a
divergent ﬂow ﬁeld is considered.
