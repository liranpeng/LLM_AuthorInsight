tion improved the modelâ€™s agreement with NOx observations
across several ocean basins.
In this paper we further develop the plume parameteriza-
tion in GEOS-Chem to better represent CH4 oxidation within
ship exhaust plumes. We then calculate the global impact of
ship NOx on abundances of O3 and CH4 and on RF. These
impact estimates change under different plume modeling as-
sumptions and accounting for sub-grid-scale chemistry re-
duces the RF of ship NOx compared to the ensemble of past
