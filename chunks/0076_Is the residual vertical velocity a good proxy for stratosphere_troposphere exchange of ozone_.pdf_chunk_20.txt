reference (as TC-e90 ﬂux) for comparison against all other diagnosed STE ﬂuxes. In section 3.1, we examine
the pathway by which O3 enters the LMS and crosses several tropopause-like surfaces. We ﬁnd that ozone
enters the LMS from middle to high latitudes predominantly during the winter season. The transport then
turns more horizontal and equatorward and crosses the tropopause surfaces at midlatitudes/subtropics
