tury climate and is therefore to some extent comparable to
the other simulations of the year 2003.
In particular the
emissions which were used by the other participating CTMs
are different. The impacts are derived using tagging meth-
ods (Grewe, 2004) and hence differ from the 5% change
approach used by other modelling groups in QUANTIFY.
