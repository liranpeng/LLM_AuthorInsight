the problem. Using the three CTMs in this study, we are able to remove the interannual variability at the sur-
face driven by stratospheric chemistry and tracer transport, thus we produce clear signal of the anomalous 
emissions from the 2010 La Ni√±a. These results highlight the capability of the QBO signal as a diagnostic 
metric with which to investigate model circulation and transport mechanisms on interannual time scales.
