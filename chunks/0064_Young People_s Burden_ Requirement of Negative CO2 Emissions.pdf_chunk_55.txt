1920. The response of surface air temperature (SAT) over
land is twice as large as the SST response to climate forc-
ings in 21st century simulations with models (Collins et
al., 2013), in good agreement with observed warming in
the industrial era (Appendix A3 this paper, Fig. A3a). The
ratio of land SAT change to SST change is reduced only
to ∼1.8 after 1000 years in climate models (Fig. A6, Ap-
pendix A6). This implies that, because land covers ∼30 %
