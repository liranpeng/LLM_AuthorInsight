increase in methane at the surface (PERT_CH4) to indirectly
diagnose the impact of hydrogen via methane changes on the
atmospheric composition.
By increasing the hydrogen surface concentration by 10%, the
models show consistent changes in atmospheric composition.
Figure 2 shows the zonal annual mean changes due to hydrogen in
OH, methane, water vapor, and ozone from the surface up to 1 hPa.
