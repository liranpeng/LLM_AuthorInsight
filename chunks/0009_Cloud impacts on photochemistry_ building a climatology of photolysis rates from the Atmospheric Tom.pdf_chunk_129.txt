these cloudy–clear J-value statistics over land will be more
difﬁcult due to the higher inherent variability in albedo and
aerosol proﬁles.
More effort is needed from the modeling community to
characterize the key factors driving these model differences
in photolysis rates under realistic, cloudy conditions. This
might include sensitivity runs that address aerosol and sur-
face albedo impacts for each model. We would also need
a better characterization of the cloud distributions used in
