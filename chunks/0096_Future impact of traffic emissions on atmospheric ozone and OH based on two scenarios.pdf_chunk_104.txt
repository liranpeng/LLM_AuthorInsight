considering the assumed future increase of SHIP emissions.
ROAD will evolve from having the largest impact on O3 RF
and the largest positive impact on net RF among the transport
sectors in 2000, to having only a modest impact on O3 and a
net RF that is likely to shift to slightly negative in 2050 (net
RF of −3.1 ± 3.4 (A1B) and −3.1 ± 2.2 mW m−2 (B1)).
The sum of net RF, taking into account O3 and CH4
effects, from all three transport sectors shows that there
