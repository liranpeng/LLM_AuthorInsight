say more about the two dominant slow feedbacks, described
above as ice sheets and GHGs.
The ice sheet feedback works mainly via the albedo (re-
ï¬‚ectivity) effect. A shrinking ice sheet exposes darker ground
and warming darkens the ice surface by increasing the area
and period with wet ice, thus increasing the ice grain size and
increasing the surface concentration of light-absorbing impu-
rities (Tedesco et al., 2016). The ice albedo effect is supple-
