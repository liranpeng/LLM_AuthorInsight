emissions have changed with technology change.
Historic stratospheric aerosol data (Table A10, annual ver-
sion), an update of Sato et al. (1993), include moderate
21st century aerosol amounts (Bourassa et al., 2012). Fu-
ture aerosols, for realistic variability, include three volcanic
eruptions in the rest of this century with properties of the
historic Agung, El Chichón and Pinatubo eruptions, plus
a background stratospheric aerosol forcing of −0.1 W m−2.
