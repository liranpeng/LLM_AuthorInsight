CSLAM
CSLAM is implemented on an equiangular cubed-sphere
grid. The average resolution at the Equator is given by

where Nc × Nc is the number of control volumes on each
face/panel of the cube. Semi-analytical trajectories are used
(Nair and Lauritzen, 2010). The diagnostics do not change
signiﬁcantly when using non-analytic trajectories (C. Erath,
personal communication, 2013). For the 1.5◦and 0.75◦reso-
