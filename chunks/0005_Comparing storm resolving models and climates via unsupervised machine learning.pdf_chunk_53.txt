The expected geographic and structural effects of climate change become apparent by inspecting the latent 
space’s leading three clusters, showing that VAEs can quantify distribution shifts due to global warming in a 
meaningful and interpretable way.
Global warming impacts on rare “Green Cumulus” convection
Finally, we hone in on the unique ways in which “Green Cumulus” Convection changes with a warming climate
