Solar-J are large (∼10%, see Figure 2 of H2017). These are likely caused by the different cross section 
for O3 absorption and the lack of O2 absorption in RRTMG (significant in the mid stratosphere). These 
differences can and should be readily resolved with some group efforts like PhotoComp (2010) but with 
diagnosed heating rates, and with the inclusion of O2 photolysis as heating. (probably no impact on 
overall cost).
