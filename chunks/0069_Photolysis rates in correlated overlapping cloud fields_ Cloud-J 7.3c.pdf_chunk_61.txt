(loss frequencies) range from 0.03 to 20 per day and some
vary greatly with altitude. For 9 of the 14 species shown in
Fig. 4, the photolysis rates are larger or comparable to the
loss rates for reaction with OH (given in the legend). Thus,
accurate calculation of their J values is important in atmo-
spheric chemistry models.
VOCs present a particular problem for any photolysis code
that averages over wavelength intervals. For most chemi-
