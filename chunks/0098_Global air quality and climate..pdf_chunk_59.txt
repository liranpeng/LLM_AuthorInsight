reductions in sulfate emissions alongside increases in BC
emissions have contributed to some of the recent warming
observed in the Arctic.111 Leibensperger et al.109 found that
direct RF from anthropogenic aerosol peaked in 1970â€“1990 at
2 W m2 over the eastern US where it cooled annual mean
temperatures over the central and eastern United States by
0.51 1C. By 2010, the forcing declined to 1.2 W m2 due
mainly to decreasing SO2 emissions. They further suggested
