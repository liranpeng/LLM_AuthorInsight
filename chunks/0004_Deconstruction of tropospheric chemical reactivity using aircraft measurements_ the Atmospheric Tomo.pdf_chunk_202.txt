is −0.37, so the CO increase will decrease L-CH4 by a fur-
ther −0.7 % to −2.9 %. The updated s∗
OH is −0.29, a 30 %
increase in magnitude, and the ff∗
CH4 is 1.41. This CO ampli-
ﬁcation may be an overestimate as some of the CO sources,
from CH4 speciﬁcally, will be reduced with OH. Another
correction is that the feedback factor used to calculate the
perturbation time for a CH4 pulse must be derived from the
total CH4 lifetime that includes losses in the stratosphere and
