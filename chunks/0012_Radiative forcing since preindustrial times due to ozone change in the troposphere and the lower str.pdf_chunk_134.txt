the geographical pattern is rather similar. The radiative forc-
ing is almost exclusively positive and a maximum in low
latitudes, being a combined effect of ozone increase, higher
temperatures, and low solar zenith angles. The longitudinal
distribution in the tropics is largely determined by the distri-
bution of ozone change and clouds. Small negative values are
seen in high southern latitudes in some of the models. This is
due to slight decreases in tropospheric ozone connected with
