backward process. Our experiments indicated that these
requirements hindered learning and compromised sample fidelityâ€‰
53. This issue is particularly relevant for the downscaling task,
which must account for large spatial shifts, correct biases in static
features like topography, and synthesize entirely new channels like
radar reflectivity. By comparison, the task of super-resolution in
natural images is much simpler, as it typically involves local
