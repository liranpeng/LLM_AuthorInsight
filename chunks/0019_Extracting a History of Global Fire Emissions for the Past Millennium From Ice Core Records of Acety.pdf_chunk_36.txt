Figure 1. Biomass burning proxies from ice core gases and from global
charcoal for the past 1,000 years. (a) Inferred biomass burning emissions
from ice core acetylene (green; Nicewonger et al., 2020), ethane
(orange; Nicewonger et al., 2018), and methane and δ13CH4
(purple; Ferretti et al., 2005). (b) Inferred biomass burning emissions from
carbon monoxide and its isotopes (pink; Wang et al., 2010) and global
ﬁre activity from global charcoal (Marlon et al., 2008).
