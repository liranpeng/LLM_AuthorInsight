there is one truism: the models always produce different re-
sults even when they agree upon the protocols, and intend
to do the same simulation. For assessments one seeks com-
mon ground to Ô¨Ånd a robust result; whereas for science one
seeks a cause of disagreement to identify how models can be
improved. This paper focuses on the latter. Given the scale
and complexity of current 3-D global chemistry models, po-
