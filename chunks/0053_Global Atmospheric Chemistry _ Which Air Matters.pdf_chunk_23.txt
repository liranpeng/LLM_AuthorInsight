tial values control the chemical evolution of the air parcels.
Knowing the correct multi-species patterns, and how differ-
ent models succeed or fail in reproducing them, will give de-
velopers the largest leverage in improving the chemical and
physical processes in the models. A critical issue in preparing
such a chemical climatology is representativeness, i.e., just
how well do the observations represent the region in which
they were made and how well should the models match the
