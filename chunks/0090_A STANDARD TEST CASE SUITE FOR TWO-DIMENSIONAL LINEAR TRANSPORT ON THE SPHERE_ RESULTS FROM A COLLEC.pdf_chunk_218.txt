preserving. The overshooting/undershooting occurs since
shape-preservation is not guaranteed in the direction traverse
to the coordinate directions.
As can be proven mathematically, only schemes that are
monotone according to the deﬁnition by Harten et al. (1987)
will guarantee that no range-preserving unmixing occurs
(Thuburn and Mclntyre, 1997). Unfortunately only ﬁrst-
order schemes are monotone according to this deﬁnition
(Godunov, 1959). In all schemes where the diffusive error
