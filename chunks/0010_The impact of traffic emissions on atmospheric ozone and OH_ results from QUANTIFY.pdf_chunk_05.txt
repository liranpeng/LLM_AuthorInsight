lower tropospheric ozone responds most sensitive to ship
emissions (50.6%±10.9% of the total trafﬁc induced per-
turbation), followed by road (36.7%±9.3%) and aircraft ex-
hausts (12.7%±2.9%), respectively. In the northern upper
troposphere between 200–300 hPa at 30–60◦N the max-
imum impact from road and ship are 93% and 73% of
the maximum effect of aircraft, respectively. The latter is
0.185 ppbv for ozone (for the 5% case) or 3.69 ppbv when
