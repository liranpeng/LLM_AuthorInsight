It is based
on NCEP reanalysis data and is also applied in the radiative
forcing calculations to be discussed in Sect. 3.
Figure 3 shows the increase in the global annual-mean
ozone column calculated for the troposphere and the lower
stratosphere separately, based on the values given in Ta-
ble 4. When taking into account chemical change only and
regarding tropospheric ozone column increase (blue bars in
Fig. 3a) the ten models agree rather well with a mean in-
