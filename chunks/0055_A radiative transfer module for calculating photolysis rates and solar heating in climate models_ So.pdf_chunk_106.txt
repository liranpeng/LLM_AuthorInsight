τ, (evaluated at 600 nm) is also written in pairs with Solar-
J’s as the ﬁrst number and RRTMG’s reduced delta-scaled
optical depth (τ ′) as the second. Both RRTMG and Solar-J
start with same value of τ because the Mie-based scattering
phase functions for liquid water are unambiguous and both
adopt the same values for re, Q, and density of liquid water.
The re is set to 9.6 µm through most of this cloud proﬁle. The
LWC increases from the surface to a maximum of 0.12 g m−3
