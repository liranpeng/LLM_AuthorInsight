pospheric chemistry, examining its ﬁnest scales and recon-
structing and parsing the O3 and CH4 budgets over the re-
mote ocean basins as sampled by the NASA Atmospheric
Tomography Mission (ATom).
ATom provided intensive, chemically comprehensive mea-
surement of air parcels (typically 10 s averages, equivalent to
2 km along ﬂight by 80 m in the vertical) and extensive four-
season semi-global 0–12 km proﬁling through the remote tro-
posphere (Wofsy et al., 2021; Thompson et al., 2022). Recent
