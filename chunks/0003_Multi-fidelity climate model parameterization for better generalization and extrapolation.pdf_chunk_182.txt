uncertainty in the tropics and temperate zone for the vertical level 259 hPa (figure 15.a), while it underestimates the uncertainty
in the same regions for the vertical level 761 hPa (figure 15.c).
For the moisture tendency, there is also a good agreement between the longitude-latitude structures of the uncertainty and
of the MAE returned by the MF-RPN and LF-RPN models for the vertical level at 259 hPa (figures 13.d and 14.d). For the
