between 2000 and 2050 as estimated in the A1B and the “policy-
failure” scenario regarding RTE. Then we investigate the conse-
quences A1B_HIGH would have on regional air quality in terms of
tropospheric O3 for a number of important world regions over the
coming decades. By using exposure recommendations provided by
the EC regarding safe air-quality standards for O3, we subsequently
determine which world regions exhibit the highest sensitivity to-
