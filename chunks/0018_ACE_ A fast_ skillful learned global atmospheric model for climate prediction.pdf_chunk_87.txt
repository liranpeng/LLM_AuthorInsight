shows slight deviations for ACE of magnitude up to 150 Pa, but no systematic multi-year drift.
It is possible that adding terms to the loss function to encourage global mean conservation of moisture
and dry air mass [18] would improve these characteristics for long simulations.

Normalization Strategy
This section describes the “residual” scaling strategy and compares it to the “full-field” normalization
