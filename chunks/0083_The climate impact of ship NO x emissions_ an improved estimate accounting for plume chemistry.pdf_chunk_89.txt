tent with available data. With parametric plume chemistry,
OPE from ship NOx is 30 % smaller than under instant dilu-
tion. Methane perturbations from ship NOx are likewise re-
duced 30 %. Parametric plume chemistry also increases the
global atmospheric CH4 lifetime compared to instant dilu-
tion, which brings the model closer to observations, bit it is
still too short.
Our best estimate of the ship NOx RF from the short-lived
O3 increase is +3.4 ± 0.85 mW m−2 for steady-state emis-
