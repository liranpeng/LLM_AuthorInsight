brought new cloud remote sensors to the field, as well as an explicit Lagrangian sampling 
approach. Two Lagrangian experiments each tracked air masses for 36-48 hours using 
instrumented aircraft (Bretherton and Pincus, 1995; Bretherton et al., 1995). The ASTEX 
Lagrangian studies, however, were not made in classic trade-wind flow and lacked aircraft-
based lidar and radar observations needed to provide a detailed mapping of cloud and 
precipitation structures.
