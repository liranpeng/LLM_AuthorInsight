L-CH4 is limited to OH loss. Overall, there is clear evidence
that the Atlantic and Paciﬁc have very different chemical
mixtures controlling the reactivities and that convection over
land (monsoon or biomass burning) creates air masses that
are still highly reactive a day or so later.

The deﬁcit in modeled P-O3 in the central and eastern Paciﬁc
at 0–2 km altitude points to a NOx deﬁciency in the models,
and this becomes obvious in the comparison of the PD his-
