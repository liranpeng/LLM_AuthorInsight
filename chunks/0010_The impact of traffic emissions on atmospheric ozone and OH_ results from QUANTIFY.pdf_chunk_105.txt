per troposphere in the southern hemisphere the effect of ship
emissions is among all modes of transport the strongest con-
tributor in January as well as in July (comp. also Fig. 7).

Relative importance of trafﬁc sectors
In addition to the perturbation of O3 the contribution of each
individual transport sector relative to the total effect from
trafﬁc is of interest. As shown in Fig. 8 the relative impact
of road and ship emissions differ substantialy although both
