which would imply an even larger GWP, but since f depends
on τCH4 the two must be chosen consistently. Uncertainty in
the GWP is difﬁcult to assess without further modeling and
analysis of stratospheric impacts, but it is likely ±20% or
larger.

Conclusions
Over 1997–2009, the three CTMs in this work exhibit com-
mon variability in methane lifetime, which is also shared
by other published model studies. The simulated τCH4×OH
anomalies generally lie within the constraints provided by
