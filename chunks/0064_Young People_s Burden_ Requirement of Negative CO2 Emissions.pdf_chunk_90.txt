mented by a change in surface albedo in ice-free regions due
to vegetation changes. This vegetation albedo effect provides
a signiﬁcant ampliﬁcation of warming as Earth’s temperature
increases from its present climate state, because dark forests
tend to replace tundra or sparse low-level vegetation in large
areas of Eurasia and North America (Lunt et al., 2010).
The GHG feedback on glacial–interglacial timescales is
75–80 % from CO2 change; N2O and CH4 account for 20–
