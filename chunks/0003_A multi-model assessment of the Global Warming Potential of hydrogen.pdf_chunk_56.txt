GFDL model with various strengths of perturbations, and there is
linearity in the perturbations. For both models, atmospheric
changes and GWP of hydrogen are very similar between the
hydrogen emission-driven and the hydrogen concentration-
driven models. Future work should test for emission location
dependency, especially NH vs. SH, aviation altitude, and ocean
vs. land.
We have calculated GWP100 by assuming that all perturba-
tions from the initial hydrogen pulse have decayed, so the steady-
