(0.04 % of data at 0.01 hPa) occur at the minimum in the O3
proﬁle and are replaced with the mean value of 0.2 ppm, with
negligible impact on photolysis rates. The negative N2O val-
ues are slightly more frequent (about 0.1 % of data at 32 and
22 hPa but 1.6 % at 0.5 hPa, where the mean value is 2.3 ppb).
We do not wish to inﬂate the N2O loss by replacing nega-
tive values with large positive ones, so we opt for the safest
choice and just replace negative N2O values with 1 ppb, again
