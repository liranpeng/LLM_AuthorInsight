middle-left show the decaying tracer N2OX; the middle-right panel is the NOAA ESRL surface N2O, 
and the bottom panels show the decaying tracer F11X. Each plot is normalized by subtracting its mean 
rate of change during the overlap period (years 2001-2016), The global mean rate of change and 
standard deviation are shown in the top caption of each panel.  Note, the scale of the F11X colorbar is 
twice the magnitude of the N2O/N2OX colorbar.
