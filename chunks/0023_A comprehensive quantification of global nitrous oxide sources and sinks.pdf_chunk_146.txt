reference mature forest. The difference between primary forests and 
secondary forests were subtracted from natural soil emissions simu-
lated by six terrestrial biosphere models in NMIP.
We calculated the ensemble of oceanic N2O emission based on the 
bottom-up approach (five ocean biogeochemical models; Supple-
mentary Table 18) and the top-down approach (five estimates from 
four inversion models; Supplementary Table 19). The atmospheric
