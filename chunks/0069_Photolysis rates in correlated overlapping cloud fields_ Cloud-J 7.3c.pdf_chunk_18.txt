the complement.
wL1(#1) = f L1
(1)
wL1(#2) = 1 −f L1
(2)
The likelihood of the cloudy layer in L2 above is
wL2(#1) = wL2(#2) = f L2.
(3)
The total weight W for each ICA #1 and #2 is then the prod-
uct of wL1 and wL2.
W L1-L2(#1) = wL1(#1)wL2(#1) = f L1f L2
= 0.15 × 0.20 = 3% (see Fig. 1)
(4)
W L1-L2(#2) = wL1(#2)wL2(#2) = (1 −f L1)f L2
= 0.85 × 0.20 = 17%
(5)
Similar rules apply to ICAs #3 and #4,
wL1(#3) = f L1 and wL2(#3) = 1 −f L2,
(6)
wL1(#4) = 1 −f L1 and wL2(#4) = 1 −f L2,
