CAFS observation represents a single point with unique solar
zenith and azimuth angles within a unique 3-D distribution
of clouds and surface albedos. Ozone column and tempera-
ture also control J values but are less discontinuous across
ﬂight path and model grids. One can deﬁne a column at-
mosphere (CA) for each J value in terms of the clouds di-
rectly above/below and the surface albedo, as would be mea-
sured by satellite nadir observations. The CAFS-measured
