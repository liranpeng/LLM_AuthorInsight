included in the ensemble NOx emissions are introduced as NO. A
clear anti-correlation exists between the seasonality of O3 and NO
due to titration of O3 under high NOx conditions. The magnitude of
the seasonal variability is determined by the photochemical activity
of each of the sub-regions, and the seasonality of biogenic and
biomass burning NOx emissions. Peaks in near-surface O3 occur
during boreal summertime in Western Europe, Eastern US, East
