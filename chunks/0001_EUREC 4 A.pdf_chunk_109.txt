the cloud patterns observed on 28 January), cloud droplets
were too small to be detected by the radar, but the lidar
could detect the presence of many successive clouds along a
roughly 10 km line of sight, i.e., half of its box-pattern width
(Fig. 10; Chazette et al., 2021). In the presence of larger
cloud droplets, normally associated with larger or more-
water-laden clouds, such as on 11 February, the radar de-
tected larger droplets and rain drops over a range of 10 km
