relative to the 1986–2005 reference period for the transient simulations, and relative to the average of the 1980 and 2000 decadal average time slices
for the ACCMIP ensemble. The average value for this reference period, averaged across all models is shown in each panel, with the standard
deviation reﬂecting the model range (transient CMIP5 models on the upper left; ACCMIP models on the upper right). In cases where multiple
