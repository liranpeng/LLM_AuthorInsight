consider the impact of land-use changes on biogenic emissions
and thereby air pollution, but some initial work suggests these
impacts could be substantial. For example, Ganzeveld et al.292
ﬁnd that global changes in land-use and land-cover (LULC)
under the SRES A2 scenario could lead to O3 changes of
B20% by 2050 in the tropics, with increases of 6 ppb over the
Amazon forest and of 9 ppb over the central African rain
forest, and smaller changes (less than 5–10%) over populated
