reactive air parcels (e.g., due to the inability to simulate in-
tensely reactive thin pollution layers), then we miss at most
5 % of the total reactivity. This ﬁnding is new and encour-
aging, and it needs to be veriﬁed with the ATom-2, 3 and 4
data.
The spatial structures and variability of reactivity as sam-
pled by the ATom tropic transects (central Paciﬁc, eastern
Paciﬁc and Atlantic) are presented as nine panels in Fig. 2.
Here, the UCI RDS∗-2 reactivities are averaged and plot-
