emission ratio from the GFED3 inventory are also shown. Peak
emissions and peak CO/NO ratio occur during El Ni˜no events, due
to tropical peat ﬁres.
degree of consistency among models. These adopted values
are used in the parametric model described below.
For biomass burning, the CTMs show moderate agreement
in the mean sensitivity when ﬁres are assumed to emit into
the boundary layer (α = 0.013 to 0.021). The τCH4×OH re-
sponse to biomass burning depends strongly on the emission
