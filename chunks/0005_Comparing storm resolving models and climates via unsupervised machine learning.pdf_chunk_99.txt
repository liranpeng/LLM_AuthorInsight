space that exhibits physical properties (vertical structure, intensity, and geographic domain) that are distinct from 
those of other groups. By identifying the maximum number of unique clusters, we are able to create three distinct 
regimes of convection, as shown in Fig. 4. We have observed that increasing K above three usually results in sub-
groups of “Deep Convection” that do not exhibit any discernible differences in either vertical mode, intensity, or
