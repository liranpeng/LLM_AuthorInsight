The

the
1990–
2015 period is changes in the well-mixed greenhouse
gases (WMGHGs). The global mean forcing due to CO2
increased over this period by 0.66 W m−2 and forcing due
to other WMGHGs rose by 0.16 W m−2 (see Supplement
for further information of the calculations). Other anthro-
pogenic forcing mechanisms had negligible overall changes
between 1990 and 2015, though natural forcing of volcanic
