Model Intercomparison Project (GFMIP). The spatial patterns of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative response from the individual GFMIP SST patch simulations are similar for ACE and the EAMv3 reference. The derived sensitivity of global net TOA radiation sensitivity to SST patch location is qualitatively similar in ACE as in EAMv3, but there are statistically significant discrepancies for some SST patches, especially over the subtropical northeast Pacific. These discrepancies may reflect
