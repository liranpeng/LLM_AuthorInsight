span a fairly wide range of O3 responses, consistent with prior
studies,57,65,240 so we focus here on the robust features. Under
all of the RCP scenarios, global NOx emissions decline over
the next century (Fig. 1), decreasing surface O3 in all regions
by 2100 with the notable exception of RCP8.5. Comparison of
Fig. 5 (which includes changes driven by both emissions and
climate) with previous published RCP emission-only projec-
tions to 2050 (see Fig. 8 of Wild et al.66 and Fig. 4 for RCP8.5)
