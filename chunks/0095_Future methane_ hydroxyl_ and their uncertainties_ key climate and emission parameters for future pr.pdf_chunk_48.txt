2 networks differ by less than 1 % (0.1811 yr−1 for NOAA,
0.1796 yr−1 for AGAGE), providing a strong constraint on
the long-term global-mean OH and methane lifetime. This
analysis, however, focuses on anomalies in the global de-
cay rate, relative to each network’s own mean. Because the
anomalies are attributed solely to tropospheric OH loss (see
below) and for comparison to τCH4×OH, the decay anomalies
are divided by r = 0.87 to account for the tropospheric OH
