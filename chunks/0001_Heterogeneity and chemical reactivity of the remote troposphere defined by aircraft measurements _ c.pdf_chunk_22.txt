ent longitudes produced nearly identical 2D PDs, but these
PDs were distinctly different across models. This result sup-
ported the premise that the ATom PDs would provide a useful
metric for global chemistry models.
In P2017, we established a method for running the chem-
istry modules in the CTMs and CCMs with an imposed
chemical composition from aircraft data: the ATom run, or
“A run”. In the A run, the chemistry of each grid cell does not
