of such a data collection with observations is beyond human
assimilative capability. Interpretation of model projections for
policy development has been a challenge to both scientists and
policymakers, as discussed by Crutzen and Oppenheimer (2008).
Assessment of the risk from climate warming was rudimen-
tary in the 1980s (Hidy and Peck, 1991). Subsequent science
investment has developed and advanced risk assessment and
atmospheric models. However, these models have not been com-
