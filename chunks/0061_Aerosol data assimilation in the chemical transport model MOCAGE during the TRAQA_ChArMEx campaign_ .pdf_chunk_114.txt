simulates the shape of the vertical proﬁle well, but it underes-
timates the aerosol concentration in the plume that the assim-
ilation corrects. For the second ﬂight, although the concen-
trations in the plume are clearly improved, near the surface,
the increase of aerosols led to a larger overestimation in the
model. Sometimes, the generalized multiplicative change of
the aerosol proﬁle in the assimilation can produce unsatisfac-
tory effects in some layers.
