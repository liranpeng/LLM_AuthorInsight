eastern Paciﬁc in ATom-34). Thus, we developed a secondary
measurement of NOx (ﬂag = 2) based on the measured value
of NO.
We look for a linear relationship between NOx and NO,
i.e., [NOxﬁt] = A [NO], and use the Paciﬁc Ocean and At-
lantic Ocean basins to avoid continental pollution. Adding
a multiplier of [O3], the right-hand side did not improve
the ﬁt. The ratio A does not depend noticeably on al-
titude. A linear ﬁt of A minimizing the errors, NOxﬁt -
