lifetime of 240 years for loss in the stratosphere (excluding OH loss) and 160 years
for soil sink43. The total lifetime of methane in CTRL and PERT_H2 can be
calculated. The methane ﬂux (i.e. the emissions needed to sustain the concentra-
tions) is calculated as the burden divided by the total methane lifetime in each
simulation. The difference in the methane ﬂux between PERT_H2 and CTRL is the
additional methane ﬂux for a 10% increase in the surface concentration of
