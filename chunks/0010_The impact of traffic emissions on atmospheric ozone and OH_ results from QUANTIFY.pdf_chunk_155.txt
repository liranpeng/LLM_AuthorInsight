of the current atmosphere have been investigated. Six mod-
els simulated the effects of trafﬁc on the current state of the
atmosphere using a small (5%) perturbation approach. The
results highlight the global impact of ship emissions on the
chemical state of the marine boundary layer. Directly at the
surface their impact can exceed 0.5% relative to the ozone
backround contributing 60–80% to the total perturbation by
trafﬁc. They strongly contribute to the tropospheric ozone
