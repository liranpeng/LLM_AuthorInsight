duced convective lofting of biomass burning emissions and,
hence, decreased CO-tracer mixing ratios in the tropical mid-
to upper troposphere in all of the CCMs. Furthermore, re-
duced convection in the tropics may also explain the dipole
pattern of change in CO-tracer mixing ratios over equatorial
and Central Africa in the lower to mid-troposphere through
greater conÔ¨Ånement of CO-tracer concentrations to the re-
gion directly aloft of the surface emissions source (Figs. 4
