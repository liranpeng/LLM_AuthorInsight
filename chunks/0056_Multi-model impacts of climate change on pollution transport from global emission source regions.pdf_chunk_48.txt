differences across the four CCMs and with season are high-
lighted. Note that the monthly average atmospheric burden of
the CO tracer is nearly identical for the 2000s and 2090s, as
expected given the speciﬁed emissions and lifetime, so that
the differences in mixing ratio discussed here result purely
from a redistribution due to changes in transport.
