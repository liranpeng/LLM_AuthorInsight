to quantifying the climate effects of the aerosols. For mod-
els with tropospheric chemistry, but lacking a stratospheric
chemistry, we encourage participation in all experiments ex-
cept those explicitly addressing the effects of halocarbons.
For tropospheric-only chemistry, the CMIP6-speciÔ¨Åed strato-
spheric ozone dataset should be used (Hegglin et al., 2017).
Modelling groups with full chemistry and aerosol models are
encouraged to perform all simulations they deem relevant
