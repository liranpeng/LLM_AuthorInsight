number concentration (near 450 cm−3), both associated with
periods of elevated mineral dust, can be identiﬁed in mea-
surements made aboard the R/V Ron Brown (east of 55◦W)
and from the ground station at Ragged Point (Pöhlker et al.,
2018). The slight lag of the Ragged Point measurements rel-

positioning of the two stations and the westward dust trans-
port by the mean ﬂow. The episodes of elevated dust are be-
