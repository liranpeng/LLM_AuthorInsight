where H is the ﬁre history, E is the emissions history based on the ice core data, and EF is the trace gas
speciﬁc emission factor. For this calculation we used boreal and non‐boreal biome‐weighted emission fac-
tors for acetylene and ethane, and a globally weighted emission factor for methane, assuming the same
