taken from TAR Appendix II. RCPn.n& values are inferred from ESMs used in CMIP5. The model mean and standard deviation is shown. ESM fossil emissions are taken from 14 models as described 
in Jones et al. (2013) although not every model has performed every scenario. See Chapter 6, Sections 6.4.3, and 6.4.3.3, and Figure 6.25.
