sea-salt sprayer perturbs transitioning clouds over a Lagrangian domain. Results show that the cloud response to aerosol injection differs significantly depending on whether stratified adjustments in the large-scale circulation in response to buoyancy perturbations are considered. Aerosol injection suppresses precipitation and enhances entrainment in both cases. Additionally, reduced surface sensible heat flux by precipitation suppression weakens boundary layer turbulence. Without the WTG,
