between 6 and 18 ppb. Therefore, by 2050 the inï¬‚uence of unmiti-
gated RTE is not crucial for meeting air quality standards in Europe
because of the measures taken with respect to the NTS (c.f. Fig.1). In
Table 2 we provide the fraction of grid cells within Europe which
exceed the EC recommendations. Here there is an increase in
exceedences from9.2% to11.2% due to unmitigated RTE in 2025, with
the difference in the impact falling to less than a percent for 2050.
