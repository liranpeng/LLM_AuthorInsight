bounded above by the 100 hPa isobaric surface and below by the e90-tropopause (LS-e90), the 120 ppb-O3
surface (LS-120 ppb), or the 250 ppb-O3 surface (LS-250 ppb). If the top and bottom surfaces do not cross
in the tropics, then the equator is used to separate the two hemispheres. The hemispheric LS O3 STE is
calculated monthly as the residual of balancing (i) the net O3 inï¬‚ux across the 100 hPa surface from the pole
