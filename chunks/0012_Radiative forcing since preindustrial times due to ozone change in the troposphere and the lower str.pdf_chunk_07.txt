three climate-chemistry models with detailed tropospheric
and stratospheric chemistry the inclusion of climate change
increases the resulting radiative forcing due to tropospheric
ozone change by up to 0.10 Wm−2, while the radiative forc-
ing due to stratospheric ozone change is reduced by up to
0.034 Wm−2.
Considering tropospheric and stratospheric change com-
bined, the total ozone column change is negative while the
resulting net radiative forcing is positive.
