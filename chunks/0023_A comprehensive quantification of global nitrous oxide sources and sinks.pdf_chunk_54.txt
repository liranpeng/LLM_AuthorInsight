1990. By contrast, fluxes from the remaining eight regions increased 
by a total of 2.9 (2.4–3.4) Tg N yr−1 (Fig. 3), of which 34% came from East 
Asia, 18% from Africa, 18% from South Asia, 13% from South America 
and 6% from North America, with the remaining increase attributed 
to the three other regions.
