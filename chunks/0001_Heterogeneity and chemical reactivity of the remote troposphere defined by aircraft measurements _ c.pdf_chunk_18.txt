(ATom), with global chemistry models. Here we present a
brief overview of those papers to help the reader under-
stand the basis for this paper. The ﬁrst ATom modeling pa-
per (“Global atmospheric chemistry – which air matters”,
Prather et al., 2017, hence P2017) gathered six global mod-
els, both chemistry transport models (CTMs) and chemistry–
climate models (CCMs). The models reported a single-day
snapshot for mid-August (the time of the ﬁrst ATom deploy-
