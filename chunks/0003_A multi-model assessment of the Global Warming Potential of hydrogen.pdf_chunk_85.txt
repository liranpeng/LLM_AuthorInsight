horizon. For use in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) the GWP is integrated over time horizons of 20 (GWP20), 100
(GWP100), and 500 (GWP500) years. In this study, we focus on GWP100 (values
of GWP20 and GWP500 are found in Supplementary).
The GWP100 of hydrogen (following 8.SM.6 from IPCC AR5 [Myhre et al.
2013])47 is deﬁned as:
