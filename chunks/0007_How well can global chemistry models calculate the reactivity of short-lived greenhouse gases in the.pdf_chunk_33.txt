identiÔ¨Åed with the rms differences across all model pairs in
Table 2). UCI ran 3 different model years to estimate the rms
value caused by interannual variability (blue in Table 2), i.e.,
when the cross-model differences approach this value, we
can accept that the photochemical modules including clouds
cannot be said to be different in this study. For the reactiv-
ities (P -O3, L-O3, L-CH4), none of the cross-model pairs
reached this lower limit, but certain groupings were consis-
