open circles). The mean reactivities (ppb/d) from the models
and ATom are given in the legend; note that these values dis-
agree with some table data that are not cosine-weighted. The
PD binning is shown by the open circles, and occurrences of
off-scale reactivities are included in the last point.
The obvious discrepancy is with P-O3 in both Paciﬁc and
Atlantic basins. ATom data have very low occurrence of P-
O3 < 1 ppb/d and a broad, almost uniform frequency (∼0.1)
