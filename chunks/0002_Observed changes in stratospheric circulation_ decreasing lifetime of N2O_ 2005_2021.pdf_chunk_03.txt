be a result of climate change. If the observed trends in lifetime and implied emissions continue, then the change
in N2O over the 21st century will be 27 % less than those projected with a ﬁxed lifetime, and the impact on
global warming and ozone depletion will be proportionately lessened. Because global warming is caused in part
by N2O, this ﬁnding is an example of a negative climate–chemistry feedback.
