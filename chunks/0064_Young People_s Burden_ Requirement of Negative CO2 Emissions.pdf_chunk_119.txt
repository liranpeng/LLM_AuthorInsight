CO2 as a function of the fossil fuel emission scenario. Fortu-
nately, the convenient dynamic-sink pulse-response function
version of the well-tested Bern carbon cycle model (Joos et
al., 1996) does a good job of approximating more detailed
models, and it produces a good match to observed industrial-
era atmospheric CO2. Thus, we use this relatively simple
model, described elsewhere (Joos et al., 1996; Kharecha and
Hansen, 2008, and references therein), to examine the effect
