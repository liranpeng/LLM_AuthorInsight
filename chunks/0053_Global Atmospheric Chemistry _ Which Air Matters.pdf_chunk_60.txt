designed (using 3-D meteorology) to address the ﬁrst three
needs (e.g., Nicely et al., 2016), it cannot address the last.
More simply, all the necessary Earth system components are
already built in to the CTMs–CCMs, and our approach of
testing the modeled climatologies includes that of testing the
Earth system components (e.g., emissions, transport, chem-
istry, scavenging, air–sea exchange, and land–surface inter-
actions).
In a standard CTM or CCM simulation (deﬁned here as
