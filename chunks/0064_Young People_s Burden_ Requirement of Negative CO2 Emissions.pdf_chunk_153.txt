Here, we do not estimate the cost of CO2 extraction
obtained via the “improved agricultural and forestry prac-
tices”,12 because that would be difﬁcult given the range of
activities it is likely to entail, and because it is not neces-
sary for reaching the conclusion that total CO2 extraction
costs will be high due to the remaining requirements for tech-
nological extraction. However, we do estimate the potential
magnitude of CO2 extraction that might be achievable via
