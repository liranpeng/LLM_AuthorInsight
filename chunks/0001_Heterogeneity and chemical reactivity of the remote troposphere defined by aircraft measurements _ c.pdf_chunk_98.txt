aging, and it needs to be veriﬁed with the ATom-2, 3, and
4 data.
The spatial structures and variability of reactivity as sam-
pled by the ATom tropical transects (central Paciﬁc, eastern
Paciﬁc, and Atlantic) are presented as nine panels in Fig. 2.
Here, the UCIZ RDS*-2 reactivities are averaged and plot-
ted in 1◦latitude by 200 m thick cells, comparable to some
global models (e.g., GMI, NCAR, and UCI). We separate the
eastern Paciﬁc (121◦W, research ﬂight (RF) 1) from the cen-
