tions for several Cloud-J species have been recalculated to
account for this. Be aware that these rescaled cross sections
apply to Cloud-J versions 7.4 and later. Cloud-J remains a
key component of Solar-J, as it produces representative sam-
ples of independent column atmospheres after considering
the topology of cloud fractions (Prather, 2015). Solar-J has
27 major bins, referred to here as S-bins, e.g., S1–S27 in
Table 4. Bins S1–S17 are taken directly from Cloud-J and
