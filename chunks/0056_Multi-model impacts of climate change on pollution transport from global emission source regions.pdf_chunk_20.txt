culation in the stratosphere, leading to higher ozone mix-
ing ratios in the mid- to upper troposphere (Butchart and
Scaife, 2001; Neu et al., 2014). Higher mixing ratios of ide-
alised tracers of stratospheric origin in the tropical and sub-
tropical troposphere have also been found due to enhanced
stratosphereâ€“troposphere exchange in a future warmer cli-
mate (Orbe et al., 2013a; Abalos et al., 2017).
Few studies have explicitly isolated the effects of climate
