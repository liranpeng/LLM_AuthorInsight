tropopause with a 3 month delay and collecting the O3 ﬂuxes every time step across 100 hPa or similar layer
will capture the lagged hemispheric cross-tropopause O3 ﬂux.
In a more stagnant stratosphere (C36) the coupling is not as strong and is mostly lost in the irregular buﬀer-
ing capacity of the lowermost stratospheric air mass. To understand this, one can look at the components
of the O3 budget in the LS method (see Figure 1j). Note that the 100 hPa ﬂux for the LS domain is calcu-
