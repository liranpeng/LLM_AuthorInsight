because NO is longer lived at high altitudes and more effectively cancels the CO sink for OH.
kSensitivity to CH4 abundance calculated from perturbations applied over 1997–2009 in UCI CTM and Oslo CTM3 and 2004–2009 in GEOS-Chem.
l f is the methane feedback factor, deﬁned as the ratio of methane perturbation lifetime to total budget lifetime (Prather et al., 2001). We calculate f using recent
estimates of all methane sinks, Prather et al. (2012). Using IPCC TAR lifetimes increases f by 0.03.
