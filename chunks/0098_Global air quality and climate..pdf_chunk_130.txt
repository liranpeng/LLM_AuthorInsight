Fig. 4 vs. mostly CCMs in Fig. 5). Under RCP8.5, the rise in
CH4 (Fig. 1) increases surface O3 levels (Fig. 4). The strong
warming in RCP8.5 may induce additional discrepancies
between Fig. 4 and 5 by altering both regional O3 production
and baseline levels, e.g. ref. 8, 221, 232 and 239.

Compared to O3, we ﬁnd fewer 21st century projections of
PM distributions over the next century. Those that exist are
diﬃcult to compare due to variations in study region and
