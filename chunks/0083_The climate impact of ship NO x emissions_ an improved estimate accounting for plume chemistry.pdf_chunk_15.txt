spheric shipping corridors (Franke et al., 2008; von Glasow
et al., 2003). In a European regional CTM, parameterizing
ship plume chemistry reduces ship-caused surface O3 by
20 % over the North Atlantic Ocean and more near coasts,
as compared to instant dilution (Huszar et al., 2010). Vinken
et al. (2011, 2014), using a different plume-in-grid approach
in the GEOS-Chem global CTM, found similar magnitude
reductions in O3 and also showed that the parameteriza-
