ing aerosol number concentration in 20 size classes within
a diameter range from 2 to 100 µm in the version of the in-
strument used in the TRAQA campaign. The uncertainty for
total concentration measurements is ±20 % when concentra-
tions are higher than 1 cm−3 and up to about ±60 % when
concentrations are smaller than 10−2 cm−3. LOAC uses the
technique of measuring aerosol at two scattering angles (Lur-
ton et al., 2014; Renard et al., 2015). During TRAQA, LOAC
