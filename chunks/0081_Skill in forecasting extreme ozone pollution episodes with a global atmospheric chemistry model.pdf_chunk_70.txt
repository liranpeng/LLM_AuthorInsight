As noted above, the MDA8 most often occurs during the af-
ternoon, which coincides with periods of a deep convective
boundary layer and avoids problems with the poorly modeled
nighttime boundary layer (Lin et al., 2008b; Lin and McEl-
roy, 2010). The present model conﬁguration was designed for
studies of stratosphere–troposphere exchange, rather than for
surface air quality analysis. As a result, emissions are speci-
