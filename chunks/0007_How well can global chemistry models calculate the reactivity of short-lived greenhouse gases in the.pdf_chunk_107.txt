ter due to use of model-generated vs. parcel-speciÔ¨Åed wa-
ter vapor; and large variability in J-values for NCAR and
GISS. Models with effectively the same chemistry module
will appear distinct if they use a different data stream for wa-
ter vapor. It is impossible to tell if overall, among the six
models, GISS has the most unique features, and GC the least.
These anomalous features can really only be explained by the
model developers who understand the coding, yet these diag-
