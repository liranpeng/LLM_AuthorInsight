The assessment of the distribution shift is a powerful tool for comparing different climate models, but also for 
investigating the impact of global warming on atmospheric convection. In this section, we apply our approach 
to the SPCAM model, which provides simulation data for two different global temperature levels: present-day 
conditions and a scenario with +4 K of sea surface temperature warming. Besides predicting changes to the
