Thus, for β = 2.5, one station at 50 km or less distance counts
as 5.7 stations, and one at 200 km counts as 0.18 stations.
Grid-cell-average QP values are calculated in the same man-
ner as the average O3 in Eq. (4). The observing sites do not
always provide continuous daily data for the decade 2000–
2009, and thus the numbers of sites that go into the daily
interpolation of each grid cell may vary. In order to keep the
