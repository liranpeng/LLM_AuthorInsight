experts in the use and application of climate information produced
elsewhere. By emphasizing the importance of local access to
advanced technologies as part of a coordinated global network of
regional centers, EVE will organically build local expertise across
the span of disciplines associated with the creation and use of
climate data, including the social and behavioral sciences whose
insights will be essential for ensuring EVE's effective and
responsible use.
