8–10 % of the average reactivity, which is about half of that
across the three models used in the reference case. Using this
criterion (< 20 %) for distinctness, we effectively have only
four independent distinctly different models here: GFDL,
GISS, NCAR and the GSFC–GC–UCI group. The four mod-
els all differ from one another at the 30–100 % level of the
UCI year-to-year variations. However, in terms of the over-
all average reactivities (Table 3), the different years of the
