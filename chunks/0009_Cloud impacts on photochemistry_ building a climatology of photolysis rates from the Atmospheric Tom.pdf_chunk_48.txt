shape is matched by most models, but the model spread of
order 20–30 % is hardly encouraging. Differences in these
average proﬁles can have many causes: temperature and O3
proﬁles, spectral data for both J-O1D and J-NO2, ways of
integrating over wavelength, surface albedo conditions, treat-
ment of Rayleigh scattering, basic radiative transfer methods,
SZA, and, of course, clouds. In typical comparisons we try to
control these differences by specifying as many conditions as
