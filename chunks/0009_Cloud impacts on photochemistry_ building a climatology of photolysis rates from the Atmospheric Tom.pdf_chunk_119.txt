that has included cloud scattering ﬁnds signiﬁcant changes
in chemical rates and budgets. For example, the inclusion of
cloud layers by Spivakovsky et al. (2000) caused a shift in
peak OH abundance from the boundary layer to just above
it, resulting in a shift to colder temperatures (and lower reac-
tion rates) for the oxidation of CH4-like gases, even with the
same average OH abundance. Other than single-column, ide-
alized, off-line tests of radiative transfer methods, we have
