affect the UT globally. Therefore Table 5 also lists the ozone
perturbations for the latitude band 30◦–60◦N. In the north-
ern upper troposphere aircraft emissions on average account
for 1.63% (scaled) to the ozone changes between 30◦–60◦N
with maximum ozone perturbations of 4.2% (scaled). These
values are lower than reported by Schumann (1997) and
slightly less than in Gauss et al. (2006).
A possible rea-
son for the discrepancies are the different model resolu-
