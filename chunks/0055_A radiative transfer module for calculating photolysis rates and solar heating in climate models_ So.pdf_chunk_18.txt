in climate models and evaluating its systematic errors re-
mains an active research topic (Li et al., 2015; Barker et al.,
2015). The errors are mostly from the inadequacy of using
a single angle to represent the scattering of cloud particles
and aerosols. For example, the anisotropic, forward-peaked
scattering of all relevant atmospheric aerosols and cloud par-
ticles cannot be represented with the two-stream approach,
and all scattering must be reduced to isotropic. To address
