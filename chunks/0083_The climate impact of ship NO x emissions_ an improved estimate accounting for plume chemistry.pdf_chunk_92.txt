(68 %) conﬁdence intervals of ±20 to ±30 %. The largest
contribution to this uncertainty arises from differing abun-
dances of photochemical oxidants in the background atmo-
sphere, which when entrained into ship plumes can alter
their chemistry. Global emissions and model formulation
both contribute to these differences in the background at-
mosphere. Further reductions in RF uncertainty are therefore
unlikely without stronger observational constraints on radi-
