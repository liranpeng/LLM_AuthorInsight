available as many national weather agencies couple km-scale
numerical weather models in a limited domain to coarser resolution
global models14 â€“ a process called dynamical downscaling. Since
these predictions are augmented by data assimilation from ground-
based precipitation radar and other sensors, good estimate of
regional km-scale atmospheric states exists15. Such dynamical
downscaling is computationally expensive, which limits the number
