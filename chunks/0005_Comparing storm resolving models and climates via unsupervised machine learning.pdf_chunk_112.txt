GSRM. Briefly, to compare Models A and B, we (1) save the K-means cluster centers from the latent vector of the 
VAE trained on Model A, (2) feed both models’ outputs into Model A’s encoder as test data, (3) obtain discrete 
distributions of cluster proportions for Model A and Model B, and (4) compute symmetrized KL divergences 
based on the discrete distributions using the right-hand side of Eq. (4).
