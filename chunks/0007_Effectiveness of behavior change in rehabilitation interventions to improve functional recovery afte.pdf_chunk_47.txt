populations or conduct of the study were atypical.
The pooled SMD for Dehghan 2016 [24], Kearney 
2021 [28], Moseley 2005 [22], Moseley 2015 [23], Nils-
son 2009, [26] and Vioreanu 2007 [30] was 0.22 (CI -0.06 
to 0.49), favouring the BCT group (non-significant). A 
forest plot is included in Fig.Â 3. There remained an insig-
nificant difference between the BCT (intervention) and 
non-BCT (control) groups when Vioreanu 2007 [30] was 
excluded: 0.07 (CI -0.06 to 0.20) in favour of the BCT
