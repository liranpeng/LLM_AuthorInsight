Figure 4. Dry matter burned inferred from each gas record (a–d) and the resulting boreal dry matter burned (e–h).
Shaded regions reﬂect the 1σ uncertainties in emissions and emission factors, which propagate into the calculation
of dry matter. Modern estimate of dry matter burned from GFED4 is shown with the black star.
