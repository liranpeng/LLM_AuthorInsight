tive nitrogen through subsequent wet scavenging. Photolysis
rates required in the chemistry mechanism are calculated on-
line using the Fast-JX method (Neu et al., 2007), with cloud
distributions from ECMWF meteorology and ozone concen-
trations calculated in the CTM. Aerosol effects on photoly-
sis are neglected except for a small contribution from black
carbon (Søvde et al., 2012), which increases OH and biases
