SST increased uniformly by 4 K. Table 3 lists the λ numbers
calculated from the Cess experiments from the present study
and from Caldwell et al. (2019). The high-resolution (0.25◦)
and low-resolution with high-resolution parameters conﬁg-
urations are denoted as HR and LRtunedHR, respectively.
With more physical representation of ozone interactions near
the tropopause, the O3v2 leads to a slightly greater (in the
magnitude) λ than the O3v1. The O3v1–O3v2 sensitivity
