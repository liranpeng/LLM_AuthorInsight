global-to-regional climate response from these changes.
Improving our insight and understanding of the inner func-
tioning of climate models and climate itself is a primary mo-
tivation for AerChemMIP. To characterise the overall ERF
from all species, including NTCFs, requires extra efforts and
has not been properly done in earlier CMIP experiments
(Forster et al., 2016). Climate feedback processes that in-
volve changes to the atmospheric composition of reactive
