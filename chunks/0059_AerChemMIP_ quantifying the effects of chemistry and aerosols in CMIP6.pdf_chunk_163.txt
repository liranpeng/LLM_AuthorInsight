sition and also its oxidation capacity through changes in the
stratospheric circulation and resulting changes in the strato-
spheric distribution of ozone and stratosphere–troposphere
transport of ozone (Collins et al., 2003; Stevenson et al.,
2006; Hegglin and Shepherd, 2009). A tagged stratospheric
ozone variable (o3ste) is deﬁned to diagnose stratosphere–
troposphere exchange, with the simulations hist-1950HC and
histSST-1950HC designed to help disentangle the impact of
