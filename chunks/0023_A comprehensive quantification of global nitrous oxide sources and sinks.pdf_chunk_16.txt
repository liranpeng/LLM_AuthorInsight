the atmosphere or water bodies as defined by the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)14; and (6) the atmospheric chemical 
sink, for which one value is derived from observations and the other 
is derived from the inversion models. To quantify and attribute the 
regional N2O budget, we further partition the Earth’s ice-free land into 
ten regions (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 1). With the construction of these 
budgets, we explore the relative temporal and spatial importance of
