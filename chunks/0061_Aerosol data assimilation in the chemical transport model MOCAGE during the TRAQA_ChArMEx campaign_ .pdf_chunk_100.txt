that the assimilation changes the model, but without a clear
improvement, could be due to different factors. This could
happen if the simulated shape of the aerosol vertical pro-
ﬁle differs from the measured one. Since we assimilate the
column-integrated quantity, which does not contain the pro-
ﬁle shape information, the model and measurements at a cer-
