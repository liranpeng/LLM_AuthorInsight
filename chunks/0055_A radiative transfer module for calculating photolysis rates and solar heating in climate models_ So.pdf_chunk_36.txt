over wavelengths for bins S1–S11 does not reach the tropo-
sphere in signiﬁcant amounts, and hence the optical prop-
erties of bin S12 are used for S1–S11 for simplicity. For the
ﬁrst 18 bins, optical properties are weighted by the solar pho-
ton ﬂux (photons cm−2 s−1), and for the last 9 bins they are
weighted by the solar energy ﬂux (W m−2). These refractive
indices are combined with a Mie scattering code and a model
for the size distribution of particles to calculate the effective
