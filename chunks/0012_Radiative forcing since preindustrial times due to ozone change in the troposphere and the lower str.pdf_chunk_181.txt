of the overwhelming impact of the stratospheric ozone de-
pletion, but the smaller change in the troposphere ozone has
a greater impact on the forcing. This appears to reï¬‚ect the
fact that much of the stratospheric loss is away from the vital
lower stratospheric region, where the ozone change has its
greatest impact on the forcing.
The main uncertainties in the radiative forcing calcula-
tions arise from the differences in global-mean ozone column
