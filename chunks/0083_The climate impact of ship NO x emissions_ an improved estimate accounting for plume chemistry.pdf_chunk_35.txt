port changes in the CH4 lifetime due to tropospheric OH (τ)
rather than the total atmospheric lifetime; these are related
via (dlnτtotal) = b(dlnτ), where the best estimates of all at-
mospheric methane losses imply b = 0.82 ± 0.03 (Prather et
al., 2012).
CTM diagnostics provide d[O3]/dE and dlnτ/dE for
each plume chemistry treatment based on 5 % perturbations
to global ship NOx emissions. Values and 1σ (68 %) conﬁ-
