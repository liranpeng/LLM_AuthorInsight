sphere and upper troposphere to the mid-troposphere can oc-
cur in the dry intrusion airstreams of cyclones (e.g. Langford
et al., 2015; Knowland et al., 2015). This is also the main
mechanism for stratosphereâ€“troposphere exchange of ozone
that occurs in the mid-latitudes and which may extend to the
surface in regions prone to deep stratospheric ozone intru-
sions (Lin et al., 2015). Deep convection is also important
for lofting surface pollution in mid-latitude regions in sum-
