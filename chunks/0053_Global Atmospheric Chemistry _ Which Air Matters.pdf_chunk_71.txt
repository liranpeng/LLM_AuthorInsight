In deÔ¨Åning the A-runs, we have thus created some biases
in the reactivities relative to the C-runs. Examination of the
NOx and HOx budgets of parallel A- and C-runs shows two
obvious differences. The A-runs lack emissions. Over the
remote ocean basins, the most important emission is NOx
(lightning, shipping, aviation). Thus A-runs show a 24 h de-
cline in NOx abundances compared with the C-runs, result-
ing in generally lower P-O3. The A-runs also lack scaveng-
