two models OsloCTM2 and EMEP, the RF (changes only to
the cloud albedo) was simulated. The differences in direct
aerosol effect found here can largely be explained by differ-
ences in the individual aerosol components, but a disentan-
gling of aerosol–cloud interaction is more complex and av-
erage differences across the models are not readily attributed
(Boucher et al., 2013).
The forcing of the total aerosol effect (the combined
aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interaction) based on
