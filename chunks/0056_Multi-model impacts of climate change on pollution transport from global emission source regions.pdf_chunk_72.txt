magnitude of ∼15 ppb (and up to 30 ppb for the region of
decrease in UM-CAM and STOC-HadAM3) (Fig. 4). The
area of increase coincides with the increase near the Equa-
tor extending from the surface to the mid-troposphere, seen
in Figs. 2 and 3 described above. This dipole pattern reﬂects
stronger conﬁnement of CO-tracer mixing ratios near regions
of emissions, ﬂanked by smaller concentrations downwind
to the south. Note that, while the zonally varying pattern of
