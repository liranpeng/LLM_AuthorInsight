models and identify their differences and similarities in sim-
ulating the chemistry through a range of innovative diagnos-
tics. All models agree that the more highly reactive parcels
dominate the chemistry (e.g., the hottest 10 % of parcels
control 25–30 % of the total reactivities), but do not fully
agree on which parcels comprise the top 10 %. Distinct dif-
ferences in speciﬁc features occur, including the spatial re-
gions of maximum ozone production and methane loss, as
