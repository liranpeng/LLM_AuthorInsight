up uses ozone and oxidants from a prior run of the interac-
tive chemistry model (e.g. Collins et al., 2011). The length
of piControl (or esm-piControl) needs to be at least as long
as the experiments. For AerChemMIP this is 205 years (164
years historical + 41 years future), although note that Eyring
et al. (2016a) recommend 500 years. It is necessary to have
CMIP6 historical simulations with the same chemistry and
aerosols as in AerChemMIP as this is used as the base-
