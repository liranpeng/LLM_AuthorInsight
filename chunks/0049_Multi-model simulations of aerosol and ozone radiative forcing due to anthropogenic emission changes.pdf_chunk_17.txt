study to perform aerosol and ozone forcing simulations over
the 1990–2015 period with their standard conﬁguration, but
using updated emission inventories and more consistent di-
agnostics. Here, we present the resulting evolution of aerosol
and ozone abundances at the regional level and the resulting
radiative forcing. In particular, the aim is to quantify the re-
cent changes in radiative forcing and how those compare to
the values reported in the IPCC AR5.
