Abstract. Measurements from actinic ﬂux spectroradiome-
ters on board the NASA DC-8 during the Atmospheric To-
mography (ATom) mission provide an extensive set of statis-
tics on how clouds alter photolysis rates (J values) through-
out the remote Paciﬁc and Atlantic Ocean basins. J values
control tropospheric ozone and methane abundances, and
thus clouds have been included for more than three decades
in tropospheric chemistry modeling. ATom made four proﬁl-
