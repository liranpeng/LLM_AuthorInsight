limited to MAX-RAN. Within Solar-J we can run both MAX-RAN (SJ/RAN) and the standard MAX-COR 
(SJ) and thus compare with J. K. P. Shonk and HoganÂ (2010), as discussed below.
Let us accept that ICAs generated by cloud overlap algorithms can be solved with 1D RT as horizontally 
homogeneous plane parallel layers, then the next step is how to solve the RT problem for all ICAs and av-
erage the results. The number of ICAs are often numerous enough that no practical climate RT code can
