the methodology of Prather et al. (2012), updated for uncertainty in lifetime and scenario changes in OH using Holmes et al. (2013) and ACCMIP results (Stevenson et al., 2013; Voulgarakis et al., 
2013). Projected RCP& abundances are best estimates with 68% confidence range as uncertainties. See also notes Tables AII.4.2 and AII.5.9.
