seen. If we perform a similar trend analysis to that shown
in Fig. 1f for the extra-tropics (i.e., 30–58◦N and 30–58◦S),
then we ﬁnd an almost identical pattern to that in the tropics:
increasing at 7 %/decade–8 %/decade versus 6 at 10 hPa and
at 14 %/decade–18 %/decade versus 13 at 3.2 hPa; see Sup-
plement Fig. S1 and Table S6. The obvious explanation is
an increase in the meridional mean ascent rate in the tropics
with little or no change in mixing across the barrier between
