sured hundreds of gases and aerosols, providing information
on the chemical patterns and reactivity in the vast remote
ocean basins, where most of the destruction of tropospheric
ozone (O3) and methane (CH4) occurs. Reactivity is deﬁned
here as in P2017 to include the production and loss of O3 (P-
O3 and L-O3, ppb d−1) and loss of CH4 (L-CH4, ppb d−1).
