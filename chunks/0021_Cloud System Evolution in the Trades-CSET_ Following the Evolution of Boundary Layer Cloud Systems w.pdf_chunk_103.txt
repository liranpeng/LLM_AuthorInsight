mesoscale variability in the time-height aerosol structure in the PBL from 0.5 to 1.8 km 
altitude. This mesoscale variability may be due to processing of the aerosols by previous 
mesoscale convective activity.
Potential temperature, mixing ratio, and wind profiles at the beginning and the end of the BC 
trajectory (Fig. 9) show the evolution of the boundary layer structure over the two-day 
period. As expected, there is substantial warming (about a 4 K increase) and moistening
