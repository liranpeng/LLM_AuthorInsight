personal communication, 2012) that includes these trends
and variability in emissions, uses identical meteorology
and resolution, and has minor other changes (version 9-01-
01). The two model conﬁgurations simulate very similar
τCH4×OH (R2 = 0.98) over 1999–2009, meaning that year-to-
year changes in biogenic and anthropogenic emissions con-
tribute little additional τCH4×OH variability and do not alter
the key parametric factors.
