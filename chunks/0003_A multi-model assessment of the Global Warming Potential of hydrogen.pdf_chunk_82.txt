rapid adjustment to microphysical properties such as liquid water content or cloud
fraction is taken into account. For aerosols we report RF and not ERF.
Calculation of ﬂuxes and budgets. For calculations of AGWP we calculated the
hydrogen ﬂux needed to sustain the 10% increase in surface concentrations of
hydrogen. As for methane, this is calculated as the difference in the ﬂux (lifetime
divided by the burden) in PERT_H2 and CTRL. The models calculate the atmo-
