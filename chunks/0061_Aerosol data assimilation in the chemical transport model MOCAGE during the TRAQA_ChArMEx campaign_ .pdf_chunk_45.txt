where 1zlev is the vertical thickness of the model level “lev”
(m), and Cext is the extinction cross-section (m−1). To calcu-
late Cext in the model we use Wiscombe’s Mie code scheme
for spherical homogeneous particles (Wiscombe, 1979, re-
vised 1996, 1980) and aerosol refractive indices from the
Global Aerosol Data Set/Optical Properties of Aerosols and
Clouds (GADS/OPAC, Köpke et al., 1997; Hess et al., 1998)
