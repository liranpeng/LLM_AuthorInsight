dance of OH in the model. The use of tracer species for this purpose is appropriate, as acetylene and ethane
are low‐level trace gases that do not signiﬁcantly impact tropospheric photochemistry (Prather, 1994). Based
on observational constraints, the best estimate of methane lifetime due to OH oxidation is 11.2 years (Prather
et al., 2012). The UCI‐CTM is slightly more reactive, with an OH methane lifetime of 8.9 years. To compen-
