dustrial era (1850).
The main features of these mod-
els are summarized in Table 1.
The horizontal resolu-
tion is highly variable between the models, ranging from
a Gaussian T42 grid (2.8◦×2.8◦) to a regular grid of 10◦
latitude×22.5◦longitude. Also, the vertical resolutions vary
among the models and with altitude, and the upper bound-
aries range from 100 hPa (∼16 km) to 0.004 hPa (∼85 km).
The CTMs use meteorological data either from their under-
