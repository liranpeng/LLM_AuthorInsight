duce 20 % of present global energy use (12.9 Gtoe). Note
that 20 % of current global energy use is a huge amount
(Fig. 13), exceeding the sum of present hydropower (6.8 %),
nuclear (4.4 %), wind (1.4 %), solar (0.4 %), and other renew-
able energies (0.9 %).
We do not suggest that new nuclear power plants on this
scale will or necessarily should be built. Rather we use this
calculation to show that mitigation costs are not large in com-
parison to costs of extracting CO2 from the air. Renewable
