higher resolution simulations while the opposite would of
greater use given the abundant low-fidelity data.
Multi-fidelity (MF) models have recently been successful
in several computational science and engineering applica-
tions40â€“46. These models are suitable for problems where
multiple datasets or computational models are available for a
given system of interest. MF models aggregate data and infor-
mation with different fidelity, i.e. level of accuracy and details
