Figure 7. Scatter plots of aerosol optical depths (where colours
represent the number of points) from the independent observation
dataset (AERONET) and the simulations: the direct model run (a)
and the assimilation model run (b). In each panel, correlation (ρ),
absolute bias (1), root mean square error (RMSE) and standard de-
viation (σ) are noted. The included data correspond to the period of
the TRAQA campaign from 25 June until 13 July 2012, and covers
all stations presented in Fig. 5.
