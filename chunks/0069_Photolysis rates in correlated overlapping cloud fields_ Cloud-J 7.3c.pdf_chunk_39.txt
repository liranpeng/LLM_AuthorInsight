Our recommended cloud-overlap model is G6/.33 since
it is based on the observedâ€“modeled cloud decorrelation
lengths. For a given FCA, we treat the J values calculated by
summing Fast-J over all the ICAs generated by G6/.33 as the
correct value. We calculate errors for the other cloud-overlap
models (here) or various ICA-approximation models using
the G6/.33 model (Sect. 3). The errors in photolysis rates are
calculated for different cloud-overlap models by generating
