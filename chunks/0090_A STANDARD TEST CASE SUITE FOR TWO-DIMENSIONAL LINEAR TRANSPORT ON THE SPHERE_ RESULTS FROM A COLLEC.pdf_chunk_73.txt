the schemes discussed so far use, the SOM method carries
ﬁve prognostic variables. The extra forecasted variables are
moments of the tracer distribution. The UCISOM scheme
has been implemented on a regular latitude–longitude grid
and on an equiangular gnomonic cubed-sphere (referred to
as UCISOM and UCISOM-CS, respectively).
