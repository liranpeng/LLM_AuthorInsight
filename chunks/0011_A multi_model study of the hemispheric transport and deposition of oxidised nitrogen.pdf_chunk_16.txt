[TarrasoÂ´n et al., 2003]. These relationships imply that a
change in emission in a given source region will result in a
particular response at a receptor. The exact response in the
receptor region will be dependent on the size of the
perturbation in the source region. The areas of the four
regions used here are large; use of emission perturbations in
smaller areas may produce different source-receptor rela-
tionships. It should also be noted that the source-receptor
