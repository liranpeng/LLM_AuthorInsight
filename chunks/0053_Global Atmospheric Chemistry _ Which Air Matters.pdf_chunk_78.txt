mate steady-state over the tropical Paciﬁc domain as seen by
comparing 12 h with 36 h, and thus these sunset–midnight–
sunrise times show the daily variations. The diurnal cycle
does produce visible shifts in the 1-D distributions, partic-
ularly at the end of the night (30 h). The shifts in HCHO are
small considering its high loss frequency, primarily because
both sources and sinks respond similarly to photolysis rates.
The seemingly longer-lived HOOH shows larger shifts be-
