sion decline.
We need to emphasize that the small scale approach is fun-
damentally different from a 100% perturbation, since non-
linearities can lead to signiÔ¨Åcant differences between both
approaches. This is illustrated in Fig.2, which shows the dif-
ferences of the ozone perturbations from a small perturba-
tion approach, which is subsequently scaled to 100% and a
100% decline of the emissions. The sensitivity study was
performed by one of the participating models (p-TOMCAT).
