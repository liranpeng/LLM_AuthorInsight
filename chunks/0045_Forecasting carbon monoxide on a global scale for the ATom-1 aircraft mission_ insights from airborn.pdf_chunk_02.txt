Abstract. The ﬁrst phase of the Atmospheric Tomography
Mission (ATom-1) took place in July–August 2016 and in-
cluded ﬂights above the remote Paciﬁc and Atlantic oceans.
Sampling of atmospheric constituents during these ﬂights
is designed to provide new insights into the chemical re-
activity and processes of the remote atmosphere and how
these processes are affected by anthropogenic emissions.
