we have a clear challenge for the cloud climatologies used in
the chemistry models.
More work on the CAFS / TUV data could help better dis-
criminate among the model classes identiÔ¨Åed here. For one,
we need to sample over different seasons and synoptic con-
ditions to build a more robust climatology. Fortunately, the
additional three deployments (ATom-2, -3, -4) will provide
these. They occur in different seasons, which is a consid-
eration, but the tropical oceanic data can probably be com-
