present as giant CCN, it may have the opposite effect (Jensen
and Nugent, 2017).
On the cloud scale, the intensity of rain and the evapo-
ration of raindrops can lead to downdrafts, cold pools, and
mesoscale circulations which can lift air parcels, produc-
ing secondary and more sustained convection (e.g., Snod-
grass et al., 2009). These cloud-scale circulations, which the
EUREC4A-Circle measurements quantiÔ¨Åed, may also change
the vigor and mixing characteristics of cloud. This could in
