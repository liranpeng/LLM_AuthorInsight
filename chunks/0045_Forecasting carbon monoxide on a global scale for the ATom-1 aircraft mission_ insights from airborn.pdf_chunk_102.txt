GEOS-5, respectively. GEOS-5 gives a reasonable reproduc-
tion of the background CO levels for most ﬂights despite
the use of climatological fossil fuel and biofuel emissions,
and it captures the global distribution of CO observed during
ATom-1. Simulations with both forecast and analysis winds
capture the timing of many of the enhanced CO plumes en-
countered during the ﬂights, although the magnitude of the
enhancements was often underestimated, which is not unex-
