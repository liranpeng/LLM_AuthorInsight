Climate changes from O3v1 to O3v2
The seemingly small changes from O3v1 to O3v2 had a sur-
prisingly large impact on the lower stratosphere (Fig. 7), with
O3v2 having about 20 % less ozone in the lower stratosphere
(Fig. A1), but hardly any change in the troposphere and small
changes in the mid-stratosphere (not shown). In this section,
