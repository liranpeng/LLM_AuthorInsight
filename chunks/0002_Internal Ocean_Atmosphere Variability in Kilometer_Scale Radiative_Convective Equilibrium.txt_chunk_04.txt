circulation is strongly modulated by convective organization, with SST playing a lesser role. When convection is highly organized, the circulation is weaker and more bottom‐heavy. Alternatively, tropospheric stratification depends on both convective organization and SST, depending on the vertical level. SST‐driven variability dominates aloft while organization‐driven variability dominates at lower levels. A similar pattern is found in ERA5 reanalysis of the equatorial Pacific. The relationship
