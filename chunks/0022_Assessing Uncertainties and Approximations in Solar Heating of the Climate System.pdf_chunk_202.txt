codes in climate models, it would be useful to establish some standard, community-wide, satellite-based 
cloud overlap models (H. W. Barker, 2008; Bankert et al., 2015; Ham et al., 2015; Kato et al., 2010; Tomp-
kins & Giuseppe, 2015) along with a simple ICA generator (e.g., M. J. Prather, 2015) to provide a basis 
for comparisons.
