metric for global chemistry models.
In P2017, we established a method for running the chem-
istry modules in the CTMs and CCMs with an imposed
chemical composition from aircraft data: the ATom run, or
“A run”. In the A run, the chemistry of each grid cell does not
interact with its neighbors or with externally imposed emis-
sion sources. Effectively the CTM/CCM is initialized and run
for 24 h without transport, scavenging or emissions. Aerosol
