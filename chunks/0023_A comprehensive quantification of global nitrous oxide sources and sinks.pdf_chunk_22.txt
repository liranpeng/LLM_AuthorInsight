are comparable in magnitude during 1998–2016, but top-down results 
imply a larger inter-annual variability (1.0 Tg N yr−1; Extended Data 
Fig. 3a). Bottom-up and top-down approaches diverge when estimat-
ing the magnitude of land emissions compared with ocean emissions, 
although they are consistent with respect to trends. Specifically, the 
bottom-up land estimate during 1998–2016 was on average 1.8 Tg N yr−1 
higher than the top-down estimate, but showed a slightly slower rate
