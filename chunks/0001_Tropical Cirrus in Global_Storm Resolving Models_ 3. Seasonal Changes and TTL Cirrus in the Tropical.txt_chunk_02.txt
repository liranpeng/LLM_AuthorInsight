Recent advances in computer modeling have spurred the production of several global storm‚Äêresolving models (GSRMs), which explicitly represent atmospheric circulations from convective to global scales. As a result, GSRMs simulate the formation and evolution of tropical cirrus clouds more physically than typical global climate models/general circulation models (GCMs) which use parameterizations to represent deep convection. We analyze the output from nine GSRMs from the DYAMOND initiative,
