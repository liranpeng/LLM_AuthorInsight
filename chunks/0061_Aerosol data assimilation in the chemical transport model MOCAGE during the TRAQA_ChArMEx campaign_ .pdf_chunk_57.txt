ence the spread of the analysis to neighbouring grid boxes,
are speciÔ¨Åed with constant correlation lengths in the horizon-
tal and the vertical. The constant and homogeneous correla-
tion lengths are modelled using a Gaussian function (Pan-
nekoucke and Massart, 2008) in terms of distance in kilo-
metres for the horizontal lengths, and in terms of number of
model levels for the vertical lengths (Massart et al., 2009).
The implemented horizontal correlation length is 45 km. For
