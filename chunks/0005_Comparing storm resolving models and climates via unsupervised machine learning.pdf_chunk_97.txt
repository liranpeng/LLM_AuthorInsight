In all experiments, we perform the clustering ten times, each with a different, random initialization and 
finally select the result with the lowest inertia. This process enables us to derive the three data-driven convection 
regimes within an GSRM, which we highlight in Fig. 3h. Notably, we never find the clusters to be strictly spatially
