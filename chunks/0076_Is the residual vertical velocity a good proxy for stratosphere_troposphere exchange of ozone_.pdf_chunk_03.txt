Abstract Stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) of ozone (O3) is key in the budget of tropospheric O3,
in turn aﬀecting climate forcing and global air quality. We compare three commonly used diagnostics meant
to quantify cross-tropopause O3 ﬂuxes with a Chemistry-Transport Model driven by two distinct European
Centre forecast ﬁelds. Our reference case calculates accurate, geographically resolved net transport across
