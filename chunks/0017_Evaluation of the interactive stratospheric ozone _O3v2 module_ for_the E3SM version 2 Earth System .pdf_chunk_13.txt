tions about the tropopause; i.e., when the tropopause rose
relative to the climatological tropopause, the ozone clima-
tology overwrite would place large stratospheric abundances
into tropospheric air masses and these errors were not sym-
metrical. Similar problems occurred in the vicinity of sub-
tropical and polar jets. Altogether, these errors have an un-
certain climate impact, and thus we implement an improved
O3v2 ozone module in E3SMv1 and perform a more com-
