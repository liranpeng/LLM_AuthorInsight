The standard Solar-J cloud optics, based on average refractive indices (H2017), should probably be re-cal-
culated with the Mie calculation at fine wavelength intervals and then with flux-averaging of SSA, Q, and 
g1:7, as in Edwards and SlingoÂ (1996). Looking forward, however, we should not have bands or sub-bins with 
such large variations in refractive index. The narrow bands have smaller changes in refractive index across
