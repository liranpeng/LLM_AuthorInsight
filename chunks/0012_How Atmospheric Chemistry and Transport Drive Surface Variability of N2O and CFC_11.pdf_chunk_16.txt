simulations that allow us to follow the signal of stratospheric loss down to the surface. We examine the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Earth System Research Laboratories (ESRL) 
surface N2O measurements for stratospheric-driven variability. The observed latitude-by-month annual pat-
terns could be caused by either emissions or the stratospheric sink; whereas the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation
