Nevison et al. (2004) and Thompson, Chevallier, et al. (2014), with the notable exception of Trinidad Head, 
which does not match other NH stations.
First, it appears that the STE flux, both annual and QBO-related, creates only small N-S gradients, ranging 
from +0.3 ppb (UCI) to −0.2 ppb (LMDz5), and thus the observed gradient (+1.3 ppb) is driven predomi-
nantly by NH emissions. Second, the modeled NH annual amplitude looks much like the observations: the
