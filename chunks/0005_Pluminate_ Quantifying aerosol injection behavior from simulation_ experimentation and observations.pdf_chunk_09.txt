in further understanding of both the potentials of
deliberate injection for marine cloud brightening
(MCB), a potential climate intervention (CI)
strategy, and key aerosol-cloud interaction
behaviors that currently form the largest
uncertainty in global climate model (GCM)
predictions of our climate. Since the rate of
