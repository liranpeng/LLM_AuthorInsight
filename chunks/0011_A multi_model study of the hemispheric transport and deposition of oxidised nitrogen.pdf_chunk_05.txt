cause eutrophication, where the extra nitrogen stimulates
rapid plant growth and leads to a change in the species
distribution and a loss of biodiversity. For example,
BergstroÂ¨m and Jansson [2006] showed that inorganic
nitrogen levels in lakes in Europe and North America
have increased over the past 40 years, resulting in eutro-
phication and increased phytoplankton biomass. The results
of the present work will be useful for other studies such as the
