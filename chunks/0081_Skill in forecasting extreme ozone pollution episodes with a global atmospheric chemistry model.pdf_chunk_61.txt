mostly biased low over all three percentiles, with greatest dif-
ferences (below −10 ppb) for the 25th percentile in Alpine
regions. In this case the area-weighted mean bias (MB) is
−3.9 ± 3.1 ppb. After investigating the average altitude of
stations for each network, we found this bias is possibly
reﬂecting preferential station placement, as the mean alti-
tude bias in the region of northern Italy and southern France
