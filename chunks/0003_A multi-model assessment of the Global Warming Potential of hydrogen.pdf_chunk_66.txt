the impact of hydrogen onto OH as estimated from a pure hydrogen perturbation
run as described in17. OsloCTM-emi ran with the same emissions ﬁles as used in
GFDL-emi, but with a smaller perturbation of 14 Tg yr−1 (a doubling of the
anthropogenic emissions). Note that for OsloCTM-emi, the hydrogen at the
surface, and hence also burden, is slightly larger in CTRL compared to the
prescribed ﬁelds used in the concentration-driven run. The increase in methane
