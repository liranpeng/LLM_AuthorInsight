due to cloud droplets and drizzle drops and can be used to calculate the vertical air motion. 
Also, when drops larger than 1.6 mm in diameter exist in the radar sample volume, a “notch” 
in the Doppler spectrum can be observed (Kollias et al. 2000) due to scattering by the drops 
in the Mie regime. The presence of the Mie notch allows the retrieval of air vertical velocity
