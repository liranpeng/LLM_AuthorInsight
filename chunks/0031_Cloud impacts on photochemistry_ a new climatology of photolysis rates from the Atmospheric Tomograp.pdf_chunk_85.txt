S. R. Hall et al.: Cloud impacts on photochemistry
do (5–10 %). When cloud brightening occurs (both CAFS
and models), the magnitude of enhancement is greater than
in the upper troposphere. Such a pattern is consistent with the
simple physics that Js are greater immediately above a cloud
than high above it.
