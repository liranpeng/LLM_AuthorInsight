involve subjective choices and are known to fail near the sub‐tropical jets and polar regions. Age‐of‐air tracers clock the effective time‐distance from the tropopause, allowing unambiguous separation of stratosphere from troposphere in the chaotic jet regions. We apply a global model with synthetic tracer e90 (90‐day e‐folding), focusing on ozone and temperature structures about the tropopause using ozone sonde and satellite observations. We calibrate an observation‐consistent tropopause for
