tical distributions, which are useful for the understanding of
forcing components (semi-direct, direct, cloud–aerosol inter-
action) of heterogeneously distributed species – in particular
black carbon and other anthropogenic aerosols. Indeed, pos-
itive forcing (warming) and the semi-direct effect of black
carbon have recently received more attention; 3-D ﬁelds of
black carbon mass mixing ratios and column integrated ab-
sorption optical depth have been used widely for analysing
