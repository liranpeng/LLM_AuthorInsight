sensitivities to emissions.

How important are climate feedbacks to natural
NTCF emissions, atmospheric composition, and
radiative effects?
In a recent assessment of 28 modelled factors that could
be a source of uncertainty in simulated cloud brightness,
Carslaw et al. (2013) identiﬁed that, in their model, approxi-
mately 45 % of the variance came from natural aerosols, es-
pecially from dimethysulﬁde (DMS) and volcanic SO2 emis-
sions. This can be compared with 34 % of the variance due to
