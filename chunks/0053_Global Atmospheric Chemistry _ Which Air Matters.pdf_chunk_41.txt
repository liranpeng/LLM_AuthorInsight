Key chemical species for tropospheric reactivity
The reactivity of an air parcel is deﬁned here as a daily aver-
age of the rates affecting critical species, in this case, ozone
(O3); a greenhouse gas and air quality threat; and methane
(CH4), the second most important emitted greenhouse gas af-
ter CO2. Methane is emitted mostly through human activities
but also naturally; and it is lost primarily (> 80 %) through
reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH) in the troposphere
