sists of a short-lived O3 component (FO3) that decays within
months after emissions and long-lived CH4 and O3 compo-
nents that persist for over a decade (FCH4 and Flong-O3, re-
spectively):
F = FO3 + FCH4 + Flong-O3.
(1)
We calculate these components in steady state from the CTM
output using a similar decomposition as Holmes et al. (2011):
FO3 = (d[O3]/dE)(dF/d[O3])1E,
(2)
FCH4 = (dlnÏ„total/dE)f [CH4](dF/d[CH4])S1E,

and
Flong-O3 = aFCH4/S,
