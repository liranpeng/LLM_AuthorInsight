(about 3 g/kg) over the period that are consistent with the increase in SST along the 
trajectory. The capping inversion defined from the soundings increases from about 1.4 km at 
the beginning of the trajectory to about 2.3 km at the end. The potential temperature and 
mixing ratio profiles show some decoupling at the beginning of the trajectory that becomes
