productive to make a more detailed comparison that identi-
ﬁes the location and other key species controlling these shifts
in reactivity.
These new diagnostics do not instantly identify the cause
of model differences, but they do add a new dimension.
For example, if we seek to understand why model D is
different, we can look at global budgets: both models A
and D have P-O3 and L-O3 tropospheric means between
2.5 and 3.5 ppb day−1, whereas the other four models have
