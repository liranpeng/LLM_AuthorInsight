function (see also Section 3.3.3 of [11] which normalized the loss with a similar motivation). First
we compute the forward increment of the normalized variables as:
a′
ff(t) = aff(t + 1) −aff(t).
(11)
Define σ(a′
ff) is the standard deviation of a′
ff. Neglecting any temporal trend in aff across the
training period, µ(a′
ff) = 0, so
σ2(a′
ff) =

We rescale the full-field-normalized variables as follows:
ares
=
aff/σres(a)
(13)
σres(a)
=
σ(a′
ff)/σ(a′
