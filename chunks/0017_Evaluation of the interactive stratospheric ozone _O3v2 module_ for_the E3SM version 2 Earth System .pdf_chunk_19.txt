The combined troposphere-plus-stratosphere ozone proﬁle is
generated by the combined Linoz chemical tendencies and
EAM tracer transport throughout the atmosphere but is then
overwritten below the instantaneous EAM tropopause with
the input4MIPS climatology even when that climatology has
stratospheric values. The ozone proﬁles are passed to the ra-
diative transfer module for radiative heating calculations.
The O3v1 package has some clear weaknesses. Overwrit-
