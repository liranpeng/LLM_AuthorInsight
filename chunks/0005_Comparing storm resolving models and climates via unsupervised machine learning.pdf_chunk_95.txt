K‑means clustering
A central element of our analysis pipeline is analyzing the distribution of the dimensionality-reduced, embedded 
data zi using K-means ­clustering60,61. We use this algorithm both for small K (yielding interpretable convection 
types) and large K (for vector quantization, see below).
