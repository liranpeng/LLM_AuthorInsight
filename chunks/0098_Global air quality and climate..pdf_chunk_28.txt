An additional, poorly quantiﬁed, indirect RF occurs when
high surface O3 concentrations damage vegetation and inter-
fere with the carbon and hydrologic cycles.33,34
Nitrogen oxides (NOx). As NOx levels are suﬃciently
low in much of the troposphere, increases in anthropogenic
NOx (NO + NO2) raise global average tropospheric O3
