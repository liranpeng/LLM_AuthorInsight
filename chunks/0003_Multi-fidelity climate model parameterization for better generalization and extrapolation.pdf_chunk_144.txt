pressure levels are quite similar with the SF-HF-RPN model improving upon the deterministic NN model in the temperate zone,
and the LF-RPN model improving further upon the SF-HF-RPN model within the temperate zone and even within the tropics
and polar regions.
For all vertical levels considered, the MF-RPN model improves even further compared to all other models across all regions,
