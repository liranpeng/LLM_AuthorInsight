aries, tending to weaken them, altering the climate simula-
tion. Thus, many Earth system models (ESMs) are now in-
corporating some form of interactive ozone chemistry.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Energy Exascale
Earth System Model version 1 (E3SMv1) (Golaz et al., 2019;
Rasch et al., 2019) implemented chemistry–climate interac-
tions through stratospheric ozone by incorporating linearized
chemistry (Linoz v2, Hsu and Prather, 2009), which could
