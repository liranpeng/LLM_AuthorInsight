Probability densities of the reactivities
The reactivities for three large domains (global, Paciﬁc, and
Atlantic) from the six-model RDS-0 are summarized in Ta-
bles 2 and S8. Sorted PDs for the three Rs and Paciﬁc and At-
lantic Ocean basins are plotted in Fig. 1 and show the impor-
tance of the most reactive “hot” parcels with deeply convex
curves and the sharp upturn in R values above 0.9 cumula-
