changes in atmospheric composition due to increased hydrogen, we ran three sets
of simulations:
CTRL: A control simulation with present-day atmospheric composition, where
hydrogen and methane surface concentrations (mole fraction) are Ô¨Åxed.
PERT_H2: As CTRL but the surface concentration of hydrogen is increased
by +10%.
PERT_CH4: As CTRL but the surface concentration of methane is increased
by +10%.
From the PERT_H2 simulation, the change in atmospheric composition and
