H. Guo et al.: Heterogeneity and chemical reactivity
H2018). All models agreed that a small fraction of chemi-
cally hot air parcels in the synthetic data set controlled most
of the total reactivity. Some models had difﬁculty in imple-
menting the A runs because they overwrote the speciﬁed wa-
ter vapor with the modeled value, but this problem is ﬁxed
here. In both P2017 and P2018, the GISS-E2 model stood
