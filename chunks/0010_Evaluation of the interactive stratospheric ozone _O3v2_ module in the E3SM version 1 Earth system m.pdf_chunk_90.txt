for O3v1, and red dots for O3v2. Smaller numbers mean bet-
ter simulations.
For the global comparisons (Fig. 10), at the top-of-
atmosphere (TOA) the radiation variables (Fig. 10a–c) are
similar or slightly better for O3v2 than for O3v1. At the sur-
face, the precipitation (Fig. 10d), surface air temperature over
land (Fig. 10e), and zonal wind stress over ocean (Fig. 10f)
remain relatively unchanged, except slight degradations for
surface air temperature over land during March–May and for
