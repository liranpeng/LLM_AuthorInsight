(Fig. 3, top left). The large increase in the NH over the same
period is in strong contrast to the B1 ACARE mitigation sce-
nario which showed a considerably lower impact on O3 in
2050 than in 2000 (H2011).
Emissions of NOx from SHIP are expected to increase
even more than for AIR between 2000 and 2050 A1B
(Fig. 1), and a corresponding increase in the ship-induced O3
impact can be seen at all latitudes and altitudes for both sea-
sons (Fig. 3, middle row). However, the absolute increase in
