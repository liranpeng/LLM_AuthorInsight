some cases (e.g., Coles, 2001). While the top 2.7 % of O3
MDA8 may seem extreme, most of these events occur during
the summer, and hence the AQX events are essentially the
upper 10 % of summer days. In general, the wider the range
for deﬁning an extreme event, the easier it will be for the
model to simulate.

Skill of the CTM
We deﬁne the skill of the CTM for each grid cell as the per-
centage of events that match the day of the observed AQX
