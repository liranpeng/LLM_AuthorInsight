region are listed in Table S2 for each model. The NOx
emissions show much less variation between models than
those of CO or NMVOC. Global methane levels were fixed at
1760 ppb in all simulations, as this value is representative of
the early 2000s [Stevenson et al., 2006].
[8] All models used meteorology for 2001, and with two
exceptions used either NCEP reanalyses, ECMWF analyses,
NASA GEOS meteorological fields, or internally generated
meteorology relaxed toward a reanalysis. Two models used
