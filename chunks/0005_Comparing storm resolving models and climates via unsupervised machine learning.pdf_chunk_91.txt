experiments, we anneal β linearly over 1600 training epochs. We use 4 layers in the encoder and decoder with 
a stride of two) (Fig. 1). We use ReLUs as the activation function in both the encoder and the decoder. We pick 
a relatively small kernel size of 3 to preserve the small-scale updrafts and downdrafts of our vertical velocity 
fields. The dimension of our latent space is 1000. For more details on the VAE design choices, see the Methods 
section ­of59.
