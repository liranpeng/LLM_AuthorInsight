canic bimodal log-normal size distributions based on Desh-
ler et al. (2003): the background distribution has a dominant
mode (98 %) with re = 0.125 µm and a secondary mode with
re = 0.432 µm for an average of re = 0.131 µm; the volcanic
distribution has a dominant mode (81 %) with re = 0.487 µm
and a secondary mode with re = 0.149 µm for an average of
re = 0.422 µm. The stratospheric aerosol properties are tab-
ulated for bins S5–S27 for a combination of temperatures
