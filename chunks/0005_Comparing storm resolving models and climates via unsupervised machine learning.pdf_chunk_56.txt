the analysis of tropical ­convection23,24,39. This is due both to its rarity and the fact that previous efforts to “rigidly” 
classify it fail to identify statistically significant differences in physical properties between “Green Cumuli” and 
other existing convection ­types40. However, the clustering of the latent space of SPCAM immediately separates 
“Green Cumulus” out into its own unique mode distinct from the rest of the continental convection.
