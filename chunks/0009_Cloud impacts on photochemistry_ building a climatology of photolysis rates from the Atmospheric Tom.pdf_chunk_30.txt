Prather, 2015). Several models ran the clear-sky case without
clouds but with their background aerosols. Globally, aerosols
have a notable impact on photolysis and chemistry (Bian et
al., 2003; Martin et al., 2003), but over the middle of the Pa-
ciﬁc Ocean (this analysis), the UCI model with and without
aerosols shows mean differences of order ±1/2 %.
Modeling the effect of clouds on J values began with early
tropospheric chemistry modeling. One approach was to per-
