with two missing G6 MAX groups between two cloudy lay-
ers, the effective cc = 0.333 = 0.036). This model is denoted
G6/.33. Two other G6 models were tested: cc = 0.00 cor-
responds to randomly overlapped adjacent groups (MAX-
RAN, G6/.00); and cc = 0.99 is almost maximally over-
lapped (MAX, G6/.99).
In looking at how this model aligned the clouds for real-
istic FCAs, we found that extensive cirrus fractions in the
uppermost layers prevented the expected overlap of small-
