also limits coastal ocean acidiﬁcation as chemical products
liberated by weathering increase land–ocean alkalinity ﬂux
(Kohler et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2016). If two-thirds of
global croplands were amended with basalt dust, as much
as 1–3 PgC yr−1 might be extracted, depending on appli-
cation rate (Taylor et al., 2016), but energy costs of min-
ing, grinding and spreading likely reduce this by 10–25 %
(Moosdorf et al., 2014). Such large-scale enhanced weath-
