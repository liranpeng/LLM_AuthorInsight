steady rise since 2007: Rigby et al. (24) find a high likeli-
hood that methane emissions rose while OH fell; Turner
et al. (25) suggest, counterintuitively, that methane
emissions decreased but OH decreased even more.
Nevertheless, both papers agree that the observational
constraints can be accommodated with differing, nearly
optimal solutions, including constant OH levels, so
there is no contradiction between their conclusions.
Although there are many emission and climate
