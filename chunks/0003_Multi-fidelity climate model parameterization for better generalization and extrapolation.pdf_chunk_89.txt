mate is more critical than the data accuracy. In this work, all
data are normalized to unit normal distribution. Hence, MF-
RPNâ€™s inputs and outputs are normalized with respect to the
mean and standard deviation of the CAM5 +8K simulation
dataset. This normalization applies to the high-fidelity train-
ing data: SPCAM5 historical run, and also to the low-fidelity
training data: CAM5 +8K run. The chosen normalization
helps the MF-RPN model account for the distribution shift
