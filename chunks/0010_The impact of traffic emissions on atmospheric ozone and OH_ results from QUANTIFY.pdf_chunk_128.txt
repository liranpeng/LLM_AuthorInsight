tions from road trafÔ¨Åc than for ship emissions.
The regional perturbation pattern (Fig. 10) illustrates that
locally the effects of road and ship emissions on OH are simi-
lar during northern summer. The strongest effect is simulated
for the ship emissions over the northern subtropical Atlantic
in the same region where also ozone exhibits the largest per-
turbation (see Fig. 5). Note furthermore that in particular
during northern summer the effect on OH at high northern
