delta-Eddington approximation (Huang, 1968; Joseph et al.,
1976). The purpose is to remove the forward-scattering peak
typical of large particles and have only isotropic-equivalent
scattering. The absorption optical depth is not changed to en-
sure correct absorption in the limit of optically thin clouds.
The basic problem with these approximations is that the
cloud optical depth is reduced by as much as a factor of 5,
and thus substantially more sunlight is transmitted through
