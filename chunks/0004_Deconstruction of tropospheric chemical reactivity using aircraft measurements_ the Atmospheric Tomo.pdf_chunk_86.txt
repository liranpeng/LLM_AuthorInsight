sonal variation in the basin-mean reactivity that could test
chemistry-climate models. Seasonal variability in the mean
reactivity proﬁles is clearly due to shifts in the chemical com-
position caused, for example, in the Atlantic by the cycle of
African biomass burning and convection. A similar reason-
ing applies to basin-wide probability densities (see Sect. 3.4
below).
