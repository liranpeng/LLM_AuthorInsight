pre-existing functional relations between tracers
This test is used to assess how schemes perturb a pre-existing
non-linear functional relation between tracers and quanti-
ﬁes the mixing that the scheme introduces. The mixing is
classiﬁed into different categories to quantify the amount
of physical realizable mixing and spurious unmixing. The
shapes of the scatterplots were examined, and large dif-
ferences between the schemes have been discovered. Also
