Abstract. This study examines the impact of the interaction of cloud microphysics and macrophysics with the large-scale circulation on the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition (SCT) using a large-eddy simulation (LES) combined with weak-temperature-gradient (WTG) parameterization. The WTG approximates large-scale circulation by inducing domain-mean subsidence to counter buoyancy perturbations relative to a reference thermodynamic profile. A stationary sea-salt sprayer perturbs transitioning
