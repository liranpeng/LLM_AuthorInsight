Therefore, the lowermost stratospheric circulation, jet streams, and stratosphere-troposphere exchange, 
and tropospheric mixing were mostly driven by climatological sea-surface temperature boundary condi-
tions, unlike the CTMs meteorologies used here that followed the synoptic weather conditions of the peri-
od. Their paper focuses on CFC-11, and the published diagnostics for modeled N2O (global mean surface) 
cannot be readily incorporated in this analysis.
