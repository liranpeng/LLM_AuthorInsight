modeled PDs are consistent with the innate chemical hetero-
geneity of the troposphere as measured by the 10 s parcels
in ATom. A related conclusion for biomass burning smoke
particles is found by Schill et al. (2020), where most of the
smoke appears in the background rather than in pollution
plumes, and therefore much of the variability occurs on syn-
optic scales resolved by global models (see their Fig. 1 com-
pared with Fig. 2 here).
