chemistry is also turned off in the A runs. This method al-
lows each parcel to evolve in response to the daily cycle of
photolysis in each model and be assigned a 24 h integrated
reactivity. The instantaneous reaction rates at the time an air
parcel is measured (e.g., near sunset at the end of a ﬂight) do
not reﬂect that parcel’s overall contribution to the CH4 or O3
budget; a full diel cycle is needed. The A run assumption that
parcels do not mix with neighboring air masses is an approx-
