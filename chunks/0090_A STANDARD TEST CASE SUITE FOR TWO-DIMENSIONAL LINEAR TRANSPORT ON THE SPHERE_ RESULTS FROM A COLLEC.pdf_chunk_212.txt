convex hull. This is particularly apparent in almost all low-
resolution (1λ ≈1.5◦) scatterplots for the shape-preserving
version of the schemes in Figs. 11–14 (second column).

Considering ﬁnite-volume schemes at 1λ ≈1.5◦, it is ob-
served that the scatter points make up a bow shape (ex-
cept CSLAM-CN5.5). In addition to all being ﬁnite-volume-
