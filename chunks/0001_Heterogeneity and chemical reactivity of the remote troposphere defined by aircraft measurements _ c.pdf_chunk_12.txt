described in this preface and discussed at most brieﬂy in the
paper. First, we found that measurement errors in PAN and
HNO4 were large (∼100 ppt), and when this occurred in the
lower troposphere, the rapid thermal decomposition released
large amounts of NOx. There is no easy ﬁx for this, and we
developed a new protocol (reactivity data stream, RDS*) for
computing reactivities by allowing the species to thermally
decompose before use in the model, as described below. This
