this fails in many important cases of atmospheric chemistry where reactions couple across species. Lifetimes, traditionally defined as total burden over loss rate, are mistaken for a time scale that describes the complete temporal behaviour of the system. Three examples here highlight: local loss frequencies with non-linear chemistry (tropospheric ozone); simple atmospheric chemistry with multiple reservoirs (methyl bromide) and fixed chemistry but evolving lifetimes (methyl chloroform). These
