art, 2014). As climate change drives the acceleration of the BDC, one 
would expect increased loss of F11 and N2O. Fu et al. (2019) finds chang-
es to the BDC over the last four decades based on satellite observations 
and reanalysis data. However, we do not see trends in N2O lifetime over 
the sustained climate change of the MLS period (2005–2018). Only GMI 
shows shifts in lifetime during the early years of the simulation (1980–
2000), but these are discredited as noted above.
