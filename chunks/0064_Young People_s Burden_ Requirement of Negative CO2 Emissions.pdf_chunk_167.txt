suppression of GHG (N2O and CO2) emissions from soils
(Edwards et al., 2017; Kantola et al., 2017). Against these
beneÔ¨Åts, we note potential negative impacts of air and water
pollution caused by the mining, including downstream envi-
ronmental consequences if silicates are washed into rivers
and the ocean, causing increased turbidity, sedimentation,
and pH, with unknown impacts on biodiversity (Edwards et
al., 2017). Cost of enhanced weathering might be reduced
