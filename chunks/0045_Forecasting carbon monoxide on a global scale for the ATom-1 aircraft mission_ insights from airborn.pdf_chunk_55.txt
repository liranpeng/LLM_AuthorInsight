responding dip in CO concentrations. GEOS-5 predicts a
plume of enhanced CO due to N. American emissions around
11Z of the Azores–Kangerlussuaq ﬂight that is not seen in
the observations (Fig. 2f, i). A similar error is made in the
Kangerlussuaq–Minneapolis ﬂight (Fig. S5). This could be
due either to an error in the assumed N. American sources or
to misplacement of the plume by the model. A large overes-
