is essential in identifying the top reactive parcels.
We plot the modeled reactivity of individual model 5-day
mean parcels in ascending order based on the sorted top-
10 % parcels in the reference case (Fig. 7). Hence the ref-
erence case (black line) is a monotonically increasing curve;
while the individual models produce a scattered distribution
of points. As expected, the three models deÔ¨Åning the refer-
ence case have some scatter but mostly overlap with the ref-
