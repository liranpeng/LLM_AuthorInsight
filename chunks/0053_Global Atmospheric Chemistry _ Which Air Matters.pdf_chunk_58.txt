drop off the list because their abundances in much of the re-
mote mid-ocean regions will have fallen below the relevance

Modeling the reactivity of air parcels
Why use the global models instead of single-box models
to calculate reactivity statistics? There are several reasons.
For one, these CTMsâ€“CCMs simulate the full meteorology
including cloud cover and its variation over large regions,
which is a critical component of reactivity. Second, they usu-
