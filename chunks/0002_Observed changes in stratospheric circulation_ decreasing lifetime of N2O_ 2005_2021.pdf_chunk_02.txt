ozone, and temperature from 2005 through 2021, we calculate the atmospheric lifetime of N2O to be decreasing
at a rate of −2.1 ± 1.2 %/decade. This decrease is occurring because the N2O abundances in the middle tropical
stratosphere, where N2O is photochemically destroyed, are increasing at a faster rate than the bulk N2O in the
lower atmosphere. The cause appears to be a more vigorous stratospheric circulation, which models predict to
