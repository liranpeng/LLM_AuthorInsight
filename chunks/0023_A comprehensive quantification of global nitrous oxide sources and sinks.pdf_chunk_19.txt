with the observed increase in atmospheric abundance of N2O between 
2007 and 2016 of 3.8–4.8 Tg N yr−1 (see Methods). Natural sources from 
soils and oceans contributed 57% of total emissions (mean: 9.7; min–
max: 8.0–12.0 Tg N yr−1) during this time, according to our bottom-up 
estimate. We further estimate the natural soil flux at 5.6 (4.9–6.5) Tg N 
yr−1 and the ocean flux at 3.4 (2.5–4.3) Tg N yr−1 (see Methods).
Anthropogenic sources contributed, on average, 43% to the total N2O
