because MAX-COR does not shift to random overlap if there is a gap in one layer. Both models show that 
increased reflection is balanced by reduced surface heating, with little change in atmospheric heating. A 
direct comparison is not possible since SH2010 did not calculate EXP-RAN for binary clouds. SH2010s EXP-
RAN appears to separate cloud layers more than the MAX-COR sub-groups, but their Tripleclouds may also
