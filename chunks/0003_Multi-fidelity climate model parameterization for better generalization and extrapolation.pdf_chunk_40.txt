high-fidelity data even without the full seasonal cycle.
Forecast skills
All surrogate models are evaluated based on their performance
on the high-fidelity test dataset corresponding to the SPCAM5
+4K simulation.
Evaluation metrics
Different evaluation metrics are considered and computed
for each output variable. We report the mean absolute error
(MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2). The MAE
is always positive and a lower value corresponds to a more
