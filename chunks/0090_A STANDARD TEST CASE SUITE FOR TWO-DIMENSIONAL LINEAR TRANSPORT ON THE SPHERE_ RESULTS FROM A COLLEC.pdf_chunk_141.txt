to CSLAM). However, at high resolution the temporal er-
rors start to dominate the standard error norms; with CN = 1
SBC solutions become more accurate than the CN = 5.5 so-
lutions when the resolution is ﬁner than approximately 1λ =
0.375◦. In other words, the temporal errors start to dominate
as the distributions are very well represented by the basis
functions used in SBC at high resolution.
