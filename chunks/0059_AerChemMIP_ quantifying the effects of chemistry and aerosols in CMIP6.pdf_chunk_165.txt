ensemble of models can be used to establish consequences
for air quality. Most interest is on particulate matter con-
centrations and high ozone peaks. Since air pollution stan-
dards have been deÔ¨Åned as exceedances for a given time
window, we request hourly data at surface level for some
few key substances, such as ozone, PM2.5 and NO2. From
these frequencies of daily maximum, diurnal cycles in dif-
ferent climate regimes, boundary layer characteristics can be
