al., 2016). Climate response to regional forcings is not lim-
ited to the region of origin, and remote responses have been
clearly demonstrated in numerical experiments (Teng et al.,
2012; Levy et al., 2013; Bollasina et al., 2013; Shindell et al.,
2015). In particular, the position of the inter-tropical conver-
gence zone (ITCZ) has been shown to depend on the differ-
ential rate of aerosol forcing between hemispheres (Hwang
et al., 2013).
