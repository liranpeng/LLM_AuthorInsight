tion from 18◦to 12◦, but instances of highly variable cloud
ﬁelds occur, even when averaged over 30◦in latitude.
For J-O1D, ﬁve models (GFDL, GSFC, GC, NCAR, UCI)
agree well over all pressures and latitude blocks, but NCAR
is, unusually, 10 % higher only in the 20◦S–20◦N block.
J-O1D from GISS is 80 % larger than other models for all
pressure and latitude blocks, but this does not translate di-
