and shortwave radiation45. Stratospheric temperature adjustment is included in the
radiative transfer calculations. There are limited studies for adjustment of methane-
induced changes in stratospheric water vapor, and the IPCC AR6 presented an
adjustment less than 1 with low conﬁdence. We choose to treat the RF values here
as ERF.
Direct aerosol effect and indirect aerosol effect is calculated ofﬂine46. For the
indirect aerosol effect only the change in effective radius is simulated. Thus, no
