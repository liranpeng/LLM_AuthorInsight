relatively low soil sink of 44 Tg yr−1, and the resulting estimated
emissions are 23 Tg yr−1, also outside the range of published
values. However, uncertainties in estimates of hydrogen emissions
are not assessed and could be larger than the range of published
studies. For instance, one study indicates that geological processes
may release over 30 Tg yr−1 of hydrogen3. For a mid-value of
published emission estimates of 38 Tg yr−1 and using the model
