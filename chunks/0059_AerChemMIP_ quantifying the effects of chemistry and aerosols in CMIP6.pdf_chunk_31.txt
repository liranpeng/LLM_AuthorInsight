Most of the CCMs included stratospheric chemistry only,
while the newer generation CCMs available now encom-
pass both tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, with a
few of these models being coupled to an ocean (John et al.,
2012; Lamarque et al., 2013; Shindell et al., 2013c; Morgen-
stern et al., 2016). The most recent comprehensive assess-
ment of the performance of these CCMs regarding strato-
spheric and tropospheric chemistry and dynamics is cur-
