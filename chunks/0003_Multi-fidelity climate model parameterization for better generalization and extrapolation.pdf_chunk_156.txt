model does not show higher errors compared to the deterministic NN. model at pressure level 259 hPa (figure 8.d), and does
improve the heat convection parameterization at pressure levels 494 and 761 hPa (figures 8.e and 8.f). Hence, the SF-HF-RPN
is capable of better resolving the convection stochasticity across different vertical levels for the heat tendency compared to the
moisture one.
