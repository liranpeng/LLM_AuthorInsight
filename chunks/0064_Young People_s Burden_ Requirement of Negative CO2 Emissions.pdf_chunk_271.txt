the global OH sink (Dlugokencky et al., 2011; Turner et al.,
2017). Evidence for increased natural sources in a warmer
climate is suggested by glacial–interglacial CH4 increases of
the order of 300 ppb, and contributions to observed ﬂuctua-
tions cannot be ruled out on the basis of recent budgets (Ciais
et al., 2013).
Methane emissions from rice agriculture and ruminants
potentially could be mitigated by changing rice grow-
ing methods (Epule et al., 2011) and inoculating rumi-
