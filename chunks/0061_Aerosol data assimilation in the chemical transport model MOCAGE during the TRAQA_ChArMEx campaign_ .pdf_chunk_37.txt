In this formulation, there is no need for an explicit speci-
ﬁcation of the inverse matrix B−1, and the preconditioning
reduces the number of iterations (Courtier et al., 1994). In
MOCAGE-Valentina, the cost function is minimized using
the limited-memory BFGS (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–
Shanno) method (Liu and Nocedal, 1989).
The minimization of the cost function with the precondi-
tioned form gives an increment of the analysis in the space
