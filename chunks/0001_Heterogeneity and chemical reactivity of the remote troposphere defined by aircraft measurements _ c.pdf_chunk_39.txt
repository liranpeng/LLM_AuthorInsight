cesses involved and the resulting highly heterogeneous dis-
tribution of chemical species that drive the reactions. Sim-
ply put, the models use emissions, photochemistry, and me-
teorological data to generate the distribution of key species
such as nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) and hydrogen
peroxide (HOOH) (step 1) and then calculate the CH4 and
O3 reactivities from these species (step 2). There is no single
average measurement that can test the verisimilitude of the
