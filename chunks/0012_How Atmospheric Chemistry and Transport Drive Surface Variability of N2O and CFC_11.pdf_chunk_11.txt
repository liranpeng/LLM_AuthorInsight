chlorofluorocarbon (CFCl3) are 
modulated (±5% amplitude) by the 
Quasi-Biennial Oscillation
•	 Stratospheric air depleted in N2O 
and CFCl3 is transported down to the 
surface where it affects the observed 
surface variability
•	 The seasonal cycle of surface N2O in 
the northern hemisphere is driven 
mostly by stratospheric loss rather 
than surface emissions
