solar heating between atmosphere and surface (5–7 W m−2) these historical improvements are greater than 
any of the next generation of errors assessed here. In terms of incident or reflected flux errors, however, 
they are smaller than the cloud uncertainties, spherical geometry, or even issues of wavelength resolution 
in the visible.
