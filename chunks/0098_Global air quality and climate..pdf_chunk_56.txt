the Arctic is particularly sensitive to BC forcing.91,101,106 In
particular, Flanner et al.107 Ô¨Ånd that deposition of BC and OC
and the subsequent snow/ice albedo feedback induces 95% as
much springtime snow cover loss over Eurasia as anthropo-
genic carbon dioxide. The combustion sources that emit BC,
also emit other aerosol components that tend to cool climate,
principally OC, so the net climate impact of emission controls
is uncertain. Ramanathan and Carmichael80 suggest that
