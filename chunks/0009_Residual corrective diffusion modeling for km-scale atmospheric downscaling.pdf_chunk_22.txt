lesser extent for temperature on 10–50 km length scales.
Temperature downscaling is an easier task that is expected to be
mostly driven by sub-grid variations in topography that can be
learned deterministically from the static grid embeddings.
Evidently, synthesizing radar from only indirectly related inputs is
the task that most benefits from the corrective diffusion component
of CorrDiff.
