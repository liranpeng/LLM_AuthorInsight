tistical patterns change with the season. We extend the anal-
ysis of Paciﬁc and Atlantic basins (Fig. 2) to the Southern
Ocean and polar regions, with a ﬁrst look at Antarctic tro-
pospheric chemistry. We present sensitivity analyses to iden-
tify which of the ATom-measured species drive the reactiv-
ities and are thus critical for the chemistry-climate models
(CCMs) to simulate accurately. We show how the sensitiv-
ity analyses of each parcel can be used to estimate the true
