Figure A5. Solar irradiance and sunspot number in the era of satellite data. Left scale is the energy passing through an area perpendicular
to Sun–Earth line. Averaged over Earth’s surface the absorbed solar energy is ∼240 W m−2, so the full amplitude of the measured solar
variability is ∼0.25 W m−2.
