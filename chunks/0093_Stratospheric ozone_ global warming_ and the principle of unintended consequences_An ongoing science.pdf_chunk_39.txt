HCFCs, and long-lived HFCs, an evaluation of the ozone
depleting potential (ODP), global warming potential (GWP),
atmospheric fate, safety, and toxicity is required for each

Hodnebrog et al. (2013) have updated GWPs and radiative
efficiencies (REs) for more than 100 halocarbons by reinterpret-
ing their infrared spectra, showing a bias of more than 5% in
previous estimates. HFC-1234yf has a short lifetime (11 days) in
the atmosphere with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as a decay pro-
