sels are larger as they operate around the clock and support
the life of a community of scientists and their laboratories at
sea. They are also more roughly estimated. We begin with
numbers from the R/V Meteor, which burns sulfate-reduced
diesel. Its burn rate is estimated as 5000 L d−1 when sta-
tionary and as much as twice that much when under way.
Given that the ships were generally steaming but with station
work mixed in, we adopt a burn rate of 8000 L d−1. Diesel is
