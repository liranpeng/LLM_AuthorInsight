Abstract  Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a long-lived greenhouse gas that affects atmospheric chemistry 
and climate. In this work, we use satellite measurements of N2O, ozone (O3), and temperature from the 
Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument to calculate stratospheric loss of N2O, and thus its 
atmospheric lifetime. Using three chemistry transport models simulating the Aura period 2005–2017, we
