used in atmospheric chemistry models report fractionally
cloudy atmospheres (FCAs) in each grid square. Computa-
tion of the photolysis or heating rates in an FCA requires
knowledge of how the clouds in each layer overlap. The cal-
culation of J values in most atmospheric chemistry models
today involves solving the radiative transfer equations in a
plane-parallel atmosphere where the vertical layers can be
highly inhomogeneous but the horizontal planes are uniform
