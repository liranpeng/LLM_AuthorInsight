∂2lnR/∂lnX∂lnY) calculated for a subsequent paper are now
closer to theoretical expectations for a quasi-linear system.
The UCIZ* model results, calculated with the UCIZ CTM
and the RDS* protocol, shown here are our best, revised es-
timate of the ATom reactivities.

Prologue
This paper is based on the methods and results of papers that
established an approach for analyzing aircraft measurements,
speciﬁcally the NASA Atmospheric Tomography Mission
