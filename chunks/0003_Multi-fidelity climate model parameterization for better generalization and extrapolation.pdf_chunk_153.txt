the South-East Pacific region, south Atlantic ocean and the African Sahara (figure 8.b). In these regions, the LF-RPN model
returns overall positive R2 values, while the MF-RPN fails to do so. This result suggests that the LF-RPN model is better at
approximating shallow convection, while the MF-RPN model does a better job at learning deep convection. The difference in
behavior can be attributed to the different datasets on which these two models have been trained since the LF-RPN is only
