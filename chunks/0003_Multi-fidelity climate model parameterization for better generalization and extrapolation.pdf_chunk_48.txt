The LF-RPN is outperforming the determinisitic NN. and
SF-HF-RPN models except within the stratosphere (where
convection is absent anyways) and for pressure levels close
to the surface (figure 2.b). This result confirms that within
the highest and lowest vertical levels, historical SPCAM5
simulation dynamics are closer to those of SPCAM5 +4K run,
while beyond them CAM5 +8K simulation provides a better
approximate of SPCAM5 +4K run dynamics. Finally, for
