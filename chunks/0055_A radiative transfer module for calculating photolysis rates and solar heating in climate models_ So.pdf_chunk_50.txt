only below 2 km, while the cirrus example has non-zero ice-
water content (IWC, g m−3) above 6 km and no liquid water
anywhere. The total cloud water content (CWC, g m−3) and
effective radius (re) are also listed in Table 3. Solar-J has
default values for re: for cirrus, they are parameterized as
re = 164 × IWC0.23 µm, based on a ﬁt to the data described
in Heymsﬁeld et al. (2003). For liquid-water clouds, they
are based loosely on observations of clean maritime stratus
