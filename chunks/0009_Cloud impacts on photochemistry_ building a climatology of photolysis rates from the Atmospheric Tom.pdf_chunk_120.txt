few methods to constrain modeled Js under cloudy condi-
tions.
The impact of clouds on Js is large, simply by looking
at the proﬁle of mean Js (Figs. 1, 2, and 3), and it greatly
complicates the comparison of J values across models. The
modeled mean clear-sky proﬁles, including the CAFS TUV
model (Fig. 2), tend to agree within ±10 % with the excep-
tion of MOCA, GISS, and sometimes IFS. However, the all-
sky (cloudy) proﬁles (Fig. 1) have a much wider spread, ex-
