atmospheric nitrogen deposition). The estimates are based on NMIP estimates 
during 1980â€“2016 including six process-based land biosphere models. Here, 
we also subtracted the difference between including and not including 
emissions from secondary forests (that grow back after pasture or cropland 
abandonment) as part of natural soil emissions based on NMIP estimates. The 
solid lines represent the ensemble and dashed lines show the minimum and
