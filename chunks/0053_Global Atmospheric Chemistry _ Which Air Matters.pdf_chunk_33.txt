CCMs can be altered slightly to calculate the reactivity of air
parcels using the native grid cells of the model and a pre-
scribed initialization of the key chemical species. This ap-
proach allows the CTMs–CCMs to be run using either model
data or observations, or a mixture of both. In Sect. 4 we de-
rive multi-dimension probability distributions for these key
variables over a suitable latitude–longitude–pressure domain
using grid-cell values from several CTMs–CCMs. Tables of
