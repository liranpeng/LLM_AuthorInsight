ulations. From Cloud-J, we take the eight-stream scatter-
ing model, semi-spherical geometry, ultraviolet transmission,
and cloud quadrature. From RRTMG-SW, we take the de-
tailed spectral intervals for the visible and infrared developed
from the RRTM reference code. Solar-J matches RRTMG-
SW except where the improved physics leads to more accu-
rate results. Selecting the best physics for all these compo-
nents comes with a cost: a simple comparison shows the cost
