temporal resolution. ACE runs stably for at least 100 years and can simulate a decade in one hour of
wall clock time, nearly 100 times faster than the reference atmospheric model, while consuming 100
times less energy. ACE predicts diagnostics such as the fluxes of energy and moisture through the top
of atmosphere and Earth surface (e.g. precipitation). The model is framed so that precise evaluation
of conservation of mass and moisture is possible and we find that column moisture is very nearly
