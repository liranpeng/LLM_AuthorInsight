models. Stratospheric studies such as Douglass et al. (1999)
have provided a quantitative basis for testing chemistry and
transport and deﬁning model errors, but few of these studies
have tackled the problem of modeling the heterogeneity of
tropospheric chemistry. The major model differences lie in
the ﬁrst step because when we specify the mix of key chemi-
cal species, most models agree on the CH4 and O3 chemical
budgets (P2018). The intent of ATom was to collect an at-
