ﬁndings of Tie and Hess [1997] and Olsen et al. [2013]. Both residual and simulated ﬂuxes have a similar sea-
sonal cycle in NH, but the total residual ﬂux is about 80% larger. By missing the peak ﬂux in austral winter
(JJA), the SH residual ﬂux fails to capture the seasonal cycle. This is due to the large erroneous upward ﬂux
inside the SH winter polar vortex (seen in Figure 1f) that cancels the downward ﬂux elsewhere.
