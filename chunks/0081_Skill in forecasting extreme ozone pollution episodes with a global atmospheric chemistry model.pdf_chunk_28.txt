to infer regions of O3 exceedance (e.g., Cooley et al., 2007;
Padoan et al., 2010).
Inverse distance weighting (IDW) and ordinary Kriging
are the most common interpolation techniques, with gen-
erally small or modest differences found between the two
(Rojas-Avellaneda and Silvan-Cardenas, 2006). Both pro-
duce estimates at unmeasured points using a weighted linear
combination of the values at neighboring sites, determined
by some function of the separation between the unmeasured
