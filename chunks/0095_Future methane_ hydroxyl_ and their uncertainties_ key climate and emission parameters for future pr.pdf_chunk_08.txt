ing IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) the Representative
Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios adopt methane tra-
jectories calculated in the MAGICC model, which augments
the TAR parametric formula with a temperature term (Mein-
shausen et al., 2011a).
On small spatial scales, OH concentrations and methane
oxidation depend on temperature, pressure, sun elevation,
clouds, surface albedo, UV attenuation by stratospheric
