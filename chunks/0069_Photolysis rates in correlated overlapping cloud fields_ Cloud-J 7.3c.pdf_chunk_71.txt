We recommend use of the G6/.33 MAX-COR model for
cloud overlap with AvQCA to approximate the average pho-
tolysis rates over the ICAs. This combination of algorithms
best matches the exact solution for average J values at a sin-
gle time within each FCA. Averaging J values for an air par-
cel that includes a mix of cloudy and clear air is not the same
as averaging the chemical reactivity across cloudy and clear.
Nevertheless, for species with photolysis rates that are less
