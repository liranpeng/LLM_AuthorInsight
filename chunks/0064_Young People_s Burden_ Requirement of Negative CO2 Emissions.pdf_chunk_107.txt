scenarios during the ﬁrst decade of the 21st century (Fig. 8a).
The decline was due to (1) decline of the airborne frac-
tion of CO2 emissions (Fig. A8), (2) slowdown of CH4
growth (Fig. 7), and (3) the Montreal Protocol, which
initiated phase-out of the production of gases that destroy
stratospheric ozone, primarily chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs).
The 2013 IPCC RCP scenarios (Fig. 8b) use observed
GHG amounts up to 2005 and diverge thereafter, fanning out
