Colorado Solar Radiation & Climate Experiment (SORCE).
Historical total solar irradiance reconstruction is available at
http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/sorce/data/tsi-data/. Data sets
are concatenated by matching the means over the ﬁrst
12 months of SORCE data. Monthly sunspot numbers sup-
port the conclusion that the solar irradiance in the current
solar cycle is signiﬁcantly lower than in the three preceding
solar cycles.
The magnitude of the change in solar irradiance from the
