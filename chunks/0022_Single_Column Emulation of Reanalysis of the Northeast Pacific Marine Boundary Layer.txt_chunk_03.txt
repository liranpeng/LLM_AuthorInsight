model, Machine‐Assisted Reanalysis Boundary Layer Emulation, skillfully reproduces the boundary layer structure and cloud properties of the reanalysis data in 7‐day single‐column prognostic simulations over withheld testing periods. Radiative heating profiles are well simulated, and the mean climatology and variability of the stratocumulus to cumulus transition are accurately reproduced. Machine‐Assisted Reanalysis Boundary Layer Emulation more closely tracks the reanalysis than does a
