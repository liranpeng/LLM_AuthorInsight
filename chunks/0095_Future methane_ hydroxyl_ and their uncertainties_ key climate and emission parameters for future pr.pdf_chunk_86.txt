emissions, and lightning NOx emissions – explain 90 % of
the interannual variation in τCH4×OH in all 3 CTMs over the
simulated period 1997–2009. Even though the GEOS-Chem
sensitivity parameters were derived from 2◦× 2.5◦simula-
tions driven by GEOS-5, the 5-parameter model performs
equally well compared to the 4◦× 5◦GEOS-Chem simula-
tion driven by MERRA. The sensitivity parameters are thus
robust across changes in model resolution and meteorology.
