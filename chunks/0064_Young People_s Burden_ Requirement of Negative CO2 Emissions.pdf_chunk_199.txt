preindustrial Holocene, attaining at least the warmth of the
Eemian period, when sea level reached +6–9 m relative to to-
day. Also, Earth is now out of energy balance, implying that
more warming will occur, even if atmospheric GHG amounts
are stabilized at today’s level. Furthermore, the GHG climate
forcing is not only still growing, the growth rate is actually
accelerating, as shown in Fig. 14, which is extracted from
data in our Fig. 8.
This summary, based on real-world data for temperature,
