including Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Israel, with the maximum ER
(>1.5) occurring around Qatar, Bahrain and the Gulf of Oman. These
maximal ER values equate to near-surface O3 mixing ratios of up to
90 ppb for a substantial part of the season. When integrating
exceedences for the entire region, Table 2 shows that w40% of the
total area in the region exhibits ER values higher than 1.0. For 2025,
the near-surface mixing ratios increase to almost w100% above the
