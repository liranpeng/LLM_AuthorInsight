are identically zero where the scheme is inactive, and condensate is zero where clouds are fully evaporated). A temperature‐scaled conditional loss function ensures accurate condensate adjustments for a high dynamic range of cloud types (e.g., cold, low‐condensate cirrus clouds or warm, condensate‐rich clouds). Despite excellent overall performance, the emulator exhibits some deficiencies in the uppermost model levels, leading to biases in the stratosphere. The emulator also has short episodic
