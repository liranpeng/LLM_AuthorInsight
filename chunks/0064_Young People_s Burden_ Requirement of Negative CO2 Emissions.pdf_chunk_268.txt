then decreases rapidly to 1650 ppb in 2100, yielding a forc-
ing change of −0.1 W m−2. However, the IPCC (Kirtman et
al., 2013) uses a more modern chemical model projection
for the RCP anthropogenic emissions and gives a less ben-
eﬁcial view with a decrease to only 1734 ppb and a forcing
change of −0.03 W m−2. RCP2.6 makes a more optimistic
assumption: that CH4 will decline monotonically to 1250 ppb
in 2100, yielding a forcing of −0.3 W m−2 (relative to to-
