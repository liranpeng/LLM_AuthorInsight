source of stratospheric odd-nitrogen species (e.g., NO, NO2,
HNO3) is production of NO in Reaction (R3), and we calcu-
late the production of NO (Figure 1d), which (like the N2O
loss) also shows a positive trend of +3.9 Â± 0.6 %/decade.
The immediate cause of the lifetime trends (i.e., enhanced
N2O loss) can be an increase in the photochemical loss fre-
quency or in the abundance of N2O, or both. The critical
zone for loss in the vertical is 3 to 30 hPa (80 % of to-
