schemes. To indicate possible multi-tracer efﬁciency, it is
also listed what parts of the algorithm can be reused for each
additional tracer. Of course for a given number of tracers, the
efﬁciency is dependent on all parameters in this table and not
just on the amount of information that can be reused.
