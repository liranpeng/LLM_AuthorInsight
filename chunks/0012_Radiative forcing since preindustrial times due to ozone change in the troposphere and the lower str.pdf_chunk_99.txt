STOCHEM HadGEM1 model, zonally and annually aver-
aged. The models with stratospheric chemistry calculate a
pronounced increase in NOx exceeding 1 ppbv in the upper
region of the domain between 25 and 30 km. This is related
primarily to the increase in N2O, which is the most important
source of NOx in this altitude range.
The ozone column changes to be discussed in this sec-
tion are listed in Table 4. For these calculations the same
tropopause deÔ¨Ånition is used for each model.
It is based
