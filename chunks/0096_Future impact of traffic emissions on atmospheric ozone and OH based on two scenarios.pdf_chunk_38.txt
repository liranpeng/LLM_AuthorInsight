Fig. 2. Mean perturbations of ozone (ppbv) during July for the 2050 A1B scenario due to a 5 % perturbation of aircraft emissions (top), ship
emissions (middle), and road trafﬁc emissions (bottom). The left column shows ozone perturbations in the upper troposphere (300–200 hPa)
for aircraft and in the lower troposphere (> 800 hPa) for ship and road trafﬁc, while the right column shows zonal mean perturbations for
