model used operationally for the region surrounding Taiwan.
Details follow. The key contributions of this paper are:
1. 1.
A physics-inspired, two-step approach termed Corrective
Diffusion (CorrDiff), which simultaneously learns mappings
between low- and high-resolution weather data across
multiple variables with high fidelity alongside new channel
synthesis.
2. 2.
For the case studies considered, CorrDiff adds physically
realistic improvements to the representation of under-
