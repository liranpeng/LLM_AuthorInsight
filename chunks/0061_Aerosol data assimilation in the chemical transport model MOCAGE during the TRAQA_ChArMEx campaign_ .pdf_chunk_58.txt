the vertical correlation, with the column-integrated observa-
tions, there is no explicit need for vertical correlation ele-
ments. However, in the matrix B preconditioned cost func-
tion (Eq. 13) it is advantageous not to have null vertical cor-
relation lengths. Therefore, we apply a vertical correlation of
one model level. The type of the correlation ﬁeld inﬂuences
the method by which the generalized diffusion-type equa-
tion is solved. In the case of constant correlation lengths in
