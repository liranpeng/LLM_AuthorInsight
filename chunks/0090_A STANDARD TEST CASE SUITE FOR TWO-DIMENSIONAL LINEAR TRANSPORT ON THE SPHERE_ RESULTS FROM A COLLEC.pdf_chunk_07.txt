of global atmospheric/ocean modeling. A library of bench-
mark results is provided to facilitate scheme intercomparison
and model development. Simple software and data sets are
made available to facilitate the process of model evaluation
and scheme intercomparison.

Introduction
Historically, the regular latitudeâ€“longitude grid has been the
preferred discretization grid in global atmosphere models
primarily due to desirable properties such as grid orthogo-
