models without interactive chemistry, RFMIP speciﬁes that
piClim-aerO3 uses the present-day tropospheric and strato-
spheric ozone climatology, whereas AerChemMIP speciﬁes
that piClim-NTCF uses the control (pre-industrial) ozone cli-
matology.

Detection and Attribution MIP (DAMIP)
There is some overlap between the AerChemMIP coupled
model experiments and those requested in DAMIP. For ex-
ample, AerChemMIP requires the extra historical runs from
