anthropogenic aerosols. Additional studies have highlighted
the role of marine biogenic aerosols (McCoy et al., 2015)
and isoprene emissions (Archibald et al., 2010) in biogeo-
chemical feedbacks. These are all examples of couplings and
potential climate feedbacks involving diverse biogeochemi-
cal cycles and terrestrial (Isaksen et al., 2009; Arneth et al.,
2010) and marine ecosystems (Cameron-Smith et al., 2011).
AerChemMIP therefore proposes to quantify the climate im-
