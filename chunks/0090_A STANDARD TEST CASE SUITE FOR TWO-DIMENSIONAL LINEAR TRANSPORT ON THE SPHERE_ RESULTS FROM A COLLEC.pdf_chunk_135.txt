tion. Other higher order schemes that are formally third-order
(MPAS), fourth-order (HOMME-p3, SFF-CSLAM4), and
seventh-order (HOMME-p6) do not converge at the asymp-
totic rate at the lower end of the resolution range. The effect
of hyperviscosity coefÔ¨Åcient on convergence rates for spec-
tral element advection can be observed by comparing CAM-
SE and HOMME-p3 (Fig. 1). Another fact contributing to the
discrepancy is the fact that in CAM-SE the transport test is
