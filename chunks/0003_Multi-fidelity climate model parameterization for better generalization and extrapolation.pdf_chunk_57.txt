pronounced improvement in these regions within the strato-
sphere (figure 4.a). Compared to the LF-RPN, the MF-RPN
model improves the heat tendency parameterization results
for the south pole across nearly all pressure levels, while it
under-performs in the north pole for vertical levels below
300 hPa.
For the moisture tendency, the SF-HF-RPN still shows
some improvement compared to the deterministic NN model,
mostly within the southern temperate zone (figure 4.b). The
