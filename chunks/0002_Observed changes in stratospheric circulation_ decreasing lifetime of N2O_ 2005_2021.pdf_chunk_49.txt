cal upper stratosphere is the cause of enhanced N2O and N2O
loss. This enhanced transport of NO led to its accumulation
in the Arctic upper stratosphere, with enhanced O3 loss there.
The modeled changes were shown to be driven by circulation
changes, and they were matched by available satellite obser-
vations. That paper has now appeared (Strahan et al., 2022).
From the results here and in P2015, we assemble a
budget for N2O from pre-industrial to the last 2 decades
