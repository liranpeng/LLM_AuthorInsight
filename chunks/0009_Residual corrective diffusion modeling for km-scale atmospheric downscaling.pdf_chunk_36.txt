where a strong horizontal 2-meter temperature gradient (top) co-
locates with both a strong divergence of the across-front wind
(bottom) and a reversal in direction of the along-front wind on
either side of the temperature front (middle). Compared to the
target data the ERA5 representation of this front is smoother.
CorrDiff partially restores sharpness to the front by increasing the
horizontal gradients across all three field variables. Although the
