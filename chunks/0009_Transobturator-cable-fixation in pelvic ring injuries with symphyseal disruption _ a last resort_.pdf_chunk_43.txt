and some patients were lost early. Despite these limitations, TOCF could
still be a viable surgical option in difficult cases where symphyseal
plating alone is at risk of failure. This case series could stimulate
valuable debate within the surgical community and generate new
research questions.
Conclusion
•  TOCF was performed in this case series without intraoperative or
early on-set complications.
•  TOCF was able to prevent loss of reduction of the pubic
symphysis.
