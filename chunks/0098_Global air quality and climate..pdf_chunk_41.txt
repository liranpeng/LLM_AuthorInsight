(Fig. 1; Nakicenovic et al.14) and numerous abatement oppor-
tunities could lessen future CH4 RF.29,57–59 The recent
WMO/UNEP report30 estimates a 0.2–0.4 K decrease by
2050 relative to a reference emission scenario if a deﬁned set
of CH4 control technologies were implemented worldwide
by 2030, corresponding to a 24% decline in anthropogenic
CH4 emissions relative to 2010 levels (Fig. 2; see also Shindell
et al.3).
Much uncertainty remains in our understanding of the
