and previous investigations.
Our ﬁndings are also evident in the vertical zonal mean
cross sections (Fig. 6), highlighting the importance of sur-
face emissions from ship and road trafﬁc for the tropical up-
per troposphere. It also shows that the impact of road traf-
ﬁc is of larger importance for the extratropical troposphere
in the northern summer hemisphere (see also Table 5). In
the tropics ship emissions are the strongest contributor to the
