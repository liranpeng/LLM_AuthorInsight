at CN = 0.2 and CN = 0.6 (Fig. 2, row 3 and 4). Contrary
to the semi-Lagrangian schemes, the solutions achieved with
longer time steps have larger errors throughout the resolu-
tion range. Since ICON-FFSL is based on a low-order spa-
tial reconstruction function, it is unlikely that the error is
dominated by time-truncation errors throughout the resolu-
tion range. Rather it appears more likely that the larger CN
errors are due to the simpliﬁed ﬂux approximation for which
