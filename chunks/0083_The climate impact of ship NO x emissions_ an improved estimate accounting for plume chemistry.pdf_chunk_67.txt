underestimate O3 production. Figure 5 also shows three RFs
estimates derived from our previous analysis of CH4 lifetime
(Holmes et al., 2013). Two of these estimates lie within the
cluster of literature values and are based on CTMs that as-
sume instant dilution, while the outlying third estimate based
on an earlier version of GEOS-Chem with ﬁxed OPE demon-
strates that plume chemistry signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the cli-
mate impact of ships.
In this work, the short-lived O3 and CH4 RFs with para-
