they are predicted by the same architecture that predicts the prognostic variables one can enforce
physical constraints such as moisture conservation which affect prognostic model weights. This
is different than some previous approaches which use a separate model to predict precipitation [16].
Data Normalization
Variables are normalized using a “residual scaling” approach such that
