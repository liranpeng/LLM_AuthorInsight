ﬂux in location and with a slight time delay of less than a
month (Jacob, 1999). In the UCI CTM, the STE ﬂux is diag-
nosed at the tropopause as deﬁned by an e90 tracer (Prather
et al., 2011) and is able to resolve the STE ﬂuxes across mul-
tiple tropopauses in the same column (Hsu et al., 2005; Tang
et al., 2013; Hsu and Prather, 2014). Near-surface uptake of
O3v2 ozone is minimal in the tropics, and thus we com-
pare these two modeled STE ﬂuxes as monthly hemispheric
means.
