each observation site is reduced by a factor Mk that is the
number of other observation sites located within a distance
D of site k. We choose D = 25 km as a typical size scale for
urban areas and test other choices below. Furthermore, all
observation sites within the region |x âˆ’xk| < D are given
equal weight to avoid singularities in the interpolation. Taken
together, the weights in Eq. (1) are
