tinuity, sampling air masses between the BCO and R/V Me-
teor stations and between the R/V Meteor and the upwind
R/V Ron Brown. The measurements provided very good
coverage through the lower (3 km) atmosphere. Air-parcel
backward trajectories based on three-dimensional wind Ô¨Åelds
from the operational ECMWF analyses indicate that bound-
ary layer air came almost exclusively from the east, with
a more heterogeneous origin of air masses sampled above
