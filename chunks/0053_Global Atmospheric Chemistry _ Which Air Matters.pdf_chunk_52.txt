For example, OH and HO2 are radical HOx species whose
abundances directly determine the rates of Reactions (1)–
(3). Nevertheless, these are not key species as their abun-
dances can be initialized to zero and are rapidly reset in sec-
onds to a temporary steady state with ﬁrst sunlight or chang-
ing clouds through Reactions (3c, d) among others (Rohrer
