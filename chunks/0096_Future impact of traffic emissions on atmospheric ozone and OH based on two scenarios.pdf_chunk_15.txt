Estimates of the future impact of trafÔ¨Åc emissions on the
atmospheric chemical composition depend strongly on as-
sumptions related to the development in economy, popula-
tion and technology. Here we investigate the effects on at-
mospheric O3, OH, and the resulting RF in a high emission
scenario for all three transport sectors, while the impacts
of a low emission scenario, including a mitigation scenario
