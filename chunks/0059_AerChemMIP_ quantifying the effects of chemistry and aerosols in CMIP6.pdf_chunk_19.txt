has led to the recognition that a combined mitigation policy
for climate change and air pollution has clear economic ben-
eÔ¨Åts compared to separate mitigation (Clarke et al., 2014).
Most, if not all, scenarios for the future actions of societies
lead to changes in the emissions and meteorology that deter-
mine air quality and create pollution episodes. The exposure
risks to human health and assets (agriculture, built environ-
ment, ecosystems) will be driven by daily variations in sur-
