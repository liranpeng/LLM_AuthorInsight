levels were compared to the ice core observations (Table S2). Emission scenarios were evaluated for two
deﬁned time periods, the MP (1000–1500 CE) when acetylene and ethane levels were high and the Little
Ice Age (LIA: 1650–1750 CE) when acetylene and ethane levels were low, using the following metrics, with
acetylene as an example:
Δacetylene; grn ¼ mgrn −ogrn
