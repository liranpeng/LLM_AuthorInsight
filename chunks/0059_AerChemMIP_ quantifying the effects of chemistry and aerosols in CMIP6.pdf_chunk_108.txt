least calculate tropospheric aerosols driven by emission ﬂuxes. Interactive chemistry should be active if available. Models should always
be run with maximum complexity. The species columns refer to the speciﬁcations for concentrations (CH4) or emissions (aerosol and
ozone precursors). “Reference” means the concentrations or emissions should evolve as for SSP3-7.0; “Clean” means the concentrations
