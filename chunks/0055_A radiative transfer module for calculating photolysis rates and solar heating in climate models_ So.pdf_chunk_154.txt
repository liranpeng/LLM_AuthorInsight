in a full atmosphere–ocean climate simulation to be 1–3 %,
then replacing it with Solar-J (5 times greater) and includ-
ing cloud quadrature (2.8 times greater), would increase this
to 13–39 %. At the lower end of this range, the substantially
improved and less noisy physics is probably worth it, but at
the upper end it is prohibitive. In either case, it is worthwhile
to pursue a range of computer science and algorithmic ap-
proaches to reduce these costs as discussed in Sect. 4.2 and
