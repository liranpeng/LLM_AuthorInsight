tain height will not match if the modelled proÔ¨Åle shape is
far from the real one, although the AOD values could match
well. A similar impact could arise if the modelled mixture of
aerosol types and the size distribution are different from the
real one. The difference in the sizes would be easily notice-
able in the aerosol number concentration, even if the mod-
elled and observed AOD values correspond well. The third
