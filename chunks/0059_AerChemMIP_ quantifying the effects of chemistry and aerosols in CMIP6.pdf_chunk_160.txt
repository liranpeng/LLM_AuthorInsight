valuable for this. The stratosphere has been identiÔ¨Åed as a po-
tentially important contributor to model differences for both
tropospheric ozone (Young et al., 2013) and the OH budget
(Voulgarakis et al., 2013). Particular focus within AerChem-
MIP will be placed on the study of how physical climate
parameters such as temperature, wind, clouds, and precipita-
tion affect tropospheric composition and the oxidising capac-
ity of the atmosphere in addition to changing emissions. To
