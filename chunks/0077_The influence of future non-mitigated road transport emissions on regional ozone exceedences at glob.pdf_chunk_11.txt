regions implies that unmitigated RTE would have a detrimental effect on regional health for 2025, and
potentially offset the beneﬁts introduced by mitigating e.g. international shipping emissions. By 2050
the further mitigation of non-transport emissions results in much cleaner air meaning that mitigation
of RTE is not critical for achieving the deﬁned limits in many world regions.
