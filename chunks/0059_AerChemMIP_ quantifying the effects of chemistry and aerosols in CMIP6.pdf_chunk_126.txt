science question 2.4)
Climate change will affect the natural emissions of NTCFs
and reactive WMGHGs. These natural emissions will have a
radiative effect and so feed back onto climate change. To sim-
plify the experimental setup, the experiments detailed here
simply double the natural emissions. The radiative effects
of natural WMGHGs (e.g. methane from natural sources)
are not calculated as these can be obtained from experi-
ment piClim-CH4. The control simulation is the 30-year
