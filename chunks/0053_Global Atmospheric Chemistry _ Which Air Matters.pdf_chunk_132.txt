some points in the center (reddish regions). For example,
models A and D show a very diffuse distribution with a much
wider spread in HOOH values at lower NOx. Even for the
four models with a central (NOx, HOOH)-line deﬁning a
peak frequency of occurrence, this line occurs at different
locations. The O3–H2O density plots (Fig. 6b) show exam-
ples of highly standard and well-measured species with ex-
treme distributions: O3 fall within 1 decade throughout most
