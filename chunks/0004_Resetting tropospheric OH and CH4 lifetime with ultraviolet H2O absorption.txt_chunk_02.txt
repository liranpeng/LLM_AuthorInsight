The decay of methyl chloroform, a banned ozone-depleting substance, has provided a clear observational metric of mean tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) abundance. Almost all current global chemistry models calculate about 15% too much OH and thus too rapid methane loss. Methane is a short-lived climate forcer, critical to achieving global warming targets, and this error affects our model projections of climate change. New observations of water vapor absorption in the ultraviolet region (290 to
