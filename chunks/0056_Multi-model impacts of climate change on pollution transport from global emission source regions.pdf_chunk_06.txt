height enabling lofting to higher altitudes, although a pole-
ward shift in the mid-latitude jets may also play a minor
role in the extratropical upper troposphere. An increase in
CO-tracer mixing ratios also occurs near the Equator, cen-
tred over equatorial and Central Africa, extending from the
surface to the mid-troposphere. This is most likely related
to localised decreases in convection in the vicinity of the
Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), resulting in larger
