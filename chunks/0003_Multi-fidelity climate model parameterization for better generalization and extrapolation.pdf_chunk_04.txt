We show the MF-RPNâ€™s capacity to return much more skillful predictions compared to either low- or high-fidelity (historical data)
simulations trained only on one regime while providing trustworthy uncertainty quantification across a wide range of scenarios.
Our approach paves the way for the use of machine-learning based methods that can optimally leverage historical observations
or high-fidelity simulations and extrapolate to unseen regimes such as climate change.
