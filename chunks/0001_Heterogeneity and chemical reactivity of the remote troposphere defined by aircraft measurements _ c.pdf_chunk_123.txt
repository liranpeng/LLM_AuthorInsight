cles). The mean reactivities (ppb d−1) from the models and
ATom are given in the legend; note that the model values are
based on the August climatologies (P2017) and not the MDS-
0 values in the table. The “ATom” legend values are the same
as in Table 2. The PD binning is shown by the open circles,
and occurrences of off-scale reactivities are included in the
last point.
For the Paciﬁc (eastern + central, left columns, Fig. 5), the
modeled PD climatologies are similar for each of the reactiv-
