for the R/V Atalante. As an example of the sensor synergy
arising from the multitude of sensors, Fig. 6 shows water
vapor ﬂux proﬁles (Behrendt et al., 2020) estimated from
co-located vertically staring Doppler wind lidar and Raman
(water vapor) lidar measurements from the ARTHUS system
(Lange et al., 2019) aboard the R/V MS-Merian. This type
of measurement strategy, employing a dense network of re-
mote sensors to both improve sampling and realize synergies,
