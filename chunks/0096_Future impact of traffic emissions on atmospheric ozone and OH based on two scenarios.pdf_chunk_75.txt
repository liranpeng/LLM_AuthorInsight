NRFs for each trafÔ¨Åc sector and for each of the six models
based on the results from Myhre et al. (2011) (year 2000) and
H2011 (years 2025/2050 and scenarios B1/B1 ACARE), the
estimated O3 RF for the A1B scenario were in most cases
less than 5 % different from the results of the detailed RF
calculations.
The resulting global average transport-induced O3 RF is
presented in Table 4 (see Table A2 for individual model re-
sults). In the future, AIR will be the transport sector with the
