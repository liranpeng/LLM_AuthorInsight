3.2.  QBO Impact
Composites of the six standard QBOs for surface N2O/N2OX in Figure 3 show a distinct pattern and gen-
eral agreement among the models and the NOAA ESRL observations, indicating that this QBO-composite 
is robust. Variability caused by emissions tied to wildfires or El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events 
would only degrade this NOAA composite. All four data sets look similar in terms of timing and latitudinal
