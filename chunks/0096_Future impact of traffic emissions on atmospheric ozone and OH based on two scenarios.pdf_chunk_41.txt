effects of including plume chemistry, the possible overesti-
mation of O3 production due to the neglect of plume pro-
cesses should be kept in mind when interpreting the results
presented in the subsequent sections.
Consistent with the studies of Hoor et al. (2009), Myhre et
al. (2011) and H2011, the results for O3 and OH (Sects. 3.1â€“
3.2) are shown unscaled, i.e. the direct effect of a 5 % emis-
sion perturbation, while CH4 lifetime changes and RF calcu-
