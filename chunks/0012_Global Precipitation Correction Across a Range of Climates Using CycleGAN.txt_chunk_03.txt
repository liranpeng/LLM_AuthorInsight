We evaluate its performance on both the target climates and an independent ramped‐SST simulation. The translated precipitation fields remove most of the biases simulated by the coarse‐grid model in the mean precipitation climatology, the cumulative distribution function of 3‐hourly precipitation, and the diurnal cycle of precipitation over land. These results highlight the potential of CycleGAN as a powerful tool for bias correction in climate change simulations, paving the way for more
