also points to a potential error in North American emissions

Model evaluation summary
We summarize the comparison between the CO simulated by
the GEOS-5 analyses and the QCLS observations in Fig. 3.
The majority of points lie near the one-to-one line, indicat-
ing good overall agreement between the GEOS-5 and ob-
served CO distributions. The higher concentrations in the
tropical Atlantic compared to the tropical PaciÔ¨Åc are evi-
