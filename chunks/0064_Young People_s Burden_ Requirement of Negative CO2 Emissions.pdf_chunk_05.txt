relative to the 1880–1920 mean and annual 2016 global temperature was almost +1.3 ◦C. We show that global
temperature has risen well out of the Holocene range and Earth is now as warm as it was during the prior
(Eemian) interglacial period, when sea level reached 6–9 m higher than today. Further, Earth is out of energy
balance with present atmospheric composition, implying that more warming is in the pipeline, and we show that
