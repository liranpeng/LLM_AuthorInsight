as annual mean precipitation from input forcing variables like CO2. The disadvantage of such an
approach is the limited physical interpretability: for example what sub-annual variability gives rise to
the annual mean? Another study [15] trains on climate model output but makes forecasts with 14- or
30-day lead times, leading to smooth predictions near the climatological mean (e.g. Fig. 20 of [15]).
