ing, in addition to one study for the direct aerosol effect
based on satellite data (Murphy, 2013). The model stud-
ies available for the 2000-2010 period based on the results
in Shindell et al. (2013a) were few compared to what was
available for earlier time periods. These studies revealed
large regional changes in the aerosol forcing over the last
decades, but in terms of global mean changes the values
