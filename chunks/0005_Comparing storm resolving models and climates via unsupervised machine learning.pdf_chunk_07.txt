analyzing it is even more challenging. To get around these barriers to understanding those simulations’ results 
simpler dimensionality reduction methods such as clustering and projections are traditionally used. However, 
these methods may not fully capture the non-linear relationships embedded in small-scale physical processes, 
which are what make these simulations so ­valuable14–16.
To gain more insight and confidence in these climate predictions, we need objective ways to quantify changes
