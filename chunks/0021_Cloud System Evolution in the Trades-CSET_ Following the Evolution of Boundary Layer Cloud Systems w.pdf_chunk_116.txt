cloud, the clouds are sufficiently optically thin that aerosols below the cloud can be observed 
with the HSRL. On the west side of the eastern cloud system two out-flow clouds at 
different heights are present. Both are sufficiently optically thin that the lidar is able to 
penetrate both layers in some areas. These types of mesoscale cloud systems were observed 
on nearly all the CSET flights and clearly indicate that these systems are fundamental to the
