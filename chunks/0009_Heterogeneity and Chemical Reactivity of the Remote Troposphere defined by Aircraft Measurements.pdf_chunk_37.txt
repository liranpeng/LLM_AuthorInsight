of the core species needed for reactivity calculations. ATom,
with a full suite of reactive species and proﬁling through the
Atlantic basin, provides a wealth of chemical statistics that
challenge the global chemistry models.
Our task here is the assembly of the modeling data stream
(MDS), which provides ﬂight-wise continuous 10 s data (air
parcels) for the key reactive species. The MDS is based on
direct observations and interpolation methods to ﬁll gaps as
