form a more accurate calculation of generic cloud layers off-
line and then apply correction factors to the clear-sky Js
computed in-line: e.g., an increase above the cloud deck and
a decrease below (Chang et al., 1987). Another approach
used a climatology of overlapping cloud decks to deﬁne a set
of opaque, fully reﬂecting surfaces at different levels; e.g.,
the Js would be averaged over these sub-grid column atmo-
spheres (Logan et al., 1981; Spivakovsky et al., 2000). As
