a Random Forest (RF) and the regression step of CorrDiff (UNet).
Using the same 12 low-resolution input channels we fit an RF for
each of the 4 output channels with 100 trees and the default
hyperparameters. The RF is applied independently at each
horizontal location similar to a 1 × 1 convolution. While crude, this
RF provides a simple (and easily tuned) baseline for the
performance of the UNet. To ensure the best performance for each
