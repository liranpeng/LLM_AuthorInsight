wind Ô¨Åeld, and surface signatures of internal waves
Sun photometer
MICROTOPS sun photometer capturing at sun views the solar attenuation at 380, 440, 670, 870,
and 940 nm to derive column properties of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at these wavelengths and the
atmospheric water vapor content
Weather sensors
German Weather Service (DWD) automatic weather station measuring underway wind speed, wind
direction, temperature (air, ocean), humidity, and barometric pressure
GNSS
