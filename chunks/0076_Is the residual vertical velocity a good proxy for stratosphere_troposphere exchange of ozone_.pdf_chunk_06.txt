[Myhre et al., 2013], and this increase also poses threats to air quality globally [Fiore et al., 2012]. The global
burden of tropospheric O3 (∼340 Tg) is maintained by a balance between photochemical tropospheric pro-
duction (∼5100 Tg/yr) and loss (∼4650 Tg/yr), surface losses (∼1000 Tg/yr), and inﬂux from the stratosphere
(∼550 Tg/yr) as estimated from multimodel studies [Stevenson et al., 2006; Young et al., 2013]. Unfortunately
