the 18 bins extend the use of opacity distribution functions
used to calculate O2 photolysis rates in the Schumann–Runge
bands (Fang et al., 1974), an equivalent to the correlated-k
method in the infrared (Lacis and Oinas, 1991). An inherent
assumption is that any other scatterers and absorbers are uni-
form across each wavelength bin, justiﬁed by the narrowness
of the bins and the lack of sharp spectral features in clouds
and aerosols. Because Cloud-J has been optimized against
