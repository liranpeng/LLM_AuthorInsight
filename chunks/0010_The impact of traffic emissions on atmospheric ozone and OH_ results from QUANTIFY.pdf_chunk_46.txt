background pollution and NOx-levels in the ppbv-range, a
small reduction of the emission enhances PO3. Therefore
the scaled ozone perturbation from the small perturbation
is larger than that from the total road perturbation. Verti-
cal transport by convection over the continents, particularly
during summer, redistributes this ozone perturbation to the
tropopause region. It is interesting that the ozone response
rather than the NOx-perturbation from road is redistributed
