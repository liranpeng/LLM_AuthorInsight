vapor by +12â€° per mm rain (for HDO), explaining observations of enriched vapor in cold pools sourced by evaporatively cooled downdrafts. Drops smaller than 0.5 mm evaporate completely before falling 700 m in typical subtropical marine boundary layer conditions. The early and complete evaporation of these smaller drops in the rain size distribution enriches the vapor produced by rain evaporation.
