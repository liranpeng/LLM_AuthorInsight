under elevated Aitken concentrations (∼100–200 mg−1). In situ measurements are used to constrain and evaluate this case study. Our simulation accurately captures observed aerosol‐cloud‐precipitation interactions and reveals time‐evolving processes driving regime development and evolution. Aitken activation into the accumulation mode in the cumulus layer provides a reservoir for turbulence and convection to carry accumulation aerosols into the drizzling stratocumulus layer above. Further Aitken
