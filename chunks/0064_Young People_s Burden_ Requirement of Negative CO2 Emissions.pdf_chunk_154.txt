such improved practices, as that is needed to quantify the re-
quired amount of “technological extraction” of CO2. Finally,
we compare costs of extraction with estimated costs of mit-
igation measures that could limit the magnitude of required
extraction, while admitting that there is large uncertainty in
both extraction and mitigation cost estimates.
