of age between the midlatitude and the tropics (see Figures S1a and S1b). More vigorous lateral mixing in
C36 between surf zone and tropical pipe is concluded from the smaller tropical N2O abundances (Figure
S1c) despite there being overall less tropical photochemical loss. The N2O and mean age correlation for C29
is closer to the observed range (shaded green in Figure S1d) [Strahan et al., 2011]. The net production of
