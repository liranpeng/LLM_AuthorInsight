latitudes. This pattern of overlapping extremes in all three
Rs is surprising because the models’ mid-Paciﬁc climatolo-
gies show a separation between regions of high L-O3 (lower–
middle troposphere) and high P-O3 (upper troposphere, as
seen in P2017’s Fig. 3). The obvious explanation is that the
models leave most of the lightning-produced NOx in the up-
per troposphere. The ATom proﬁling seems to catch reactive
regions in adjacent proﬁles separate by a few hundred kilo-
