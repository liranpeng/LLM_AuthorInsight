private standards and industry associations.
 Considering that HFC-152a has higher potential for energy
efficiency than either HFC-1234yf or CO2 in MACs, and that
HFC-152a produces no TFA atmospheric by-products.
Furthermore, recent scientific studies of atmospheric lifetime
report a lower GWP for HFC-1234yf to <1, making it superior
with respect to the GWP of CO2. However, the analysis will
want to stay focused on LCCP because the energy embodied
