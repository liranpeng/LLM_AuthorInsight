zeros at an SZA of 90◦due to the lack of sphericity correction in the plane-parallel approximation, whereas the impact of sphericity on the
direct solar beam path is included in Solar-J.

of sphericity in RRTMG leads to large systematic negative
biases in the heating rates at low sun. Sphericity errors ex-
