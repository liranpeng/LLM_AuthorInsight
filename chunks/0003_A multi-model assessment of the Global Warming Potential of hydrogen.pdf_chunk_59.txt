NOx, methane, and CO. These levels are likely to change in the
future and may also inﬂuence the climate impacts of hydrogen,
making it stronger or weaker. For instance, Warwick et al.16 ﬁnds
that a reduction in CO, NOx, and VOC emissions alongside
increases in hydrogen leads to smaller increase in methane due to
a reduction in OH, but that the total response is complex and
strongly scenario dependent. Future work should explore these
dependencies further, including changes in co-emitted species
