are often larger for biomass burning and natural emissions
(Granier et al., 2011). If the two inventories in GEOS-Chem
exhibit typical differences, then inventory uncertainty may
account for Â±10 % range in ship NOx RF. Uncertainties in
chemistry, transport, and other processes that control back-
ground atmospheric composition contribute as much or more
than emissions to the range in RF responses across models,
since multi-model studies using common emissions still ex-
