emissions are important (Lelieveld and Crutzen, 1994; Spi-
vakovsky et al., 2000; Dentener et al., 2003; Stevenson et
al., 2005; Dalsoren et al., 2006; Fiore et al., 2006; Hess and
Mahowald, 2009; Voulgarakis et al., 2010). Uncertainties in
these factors and in the present-day methane budget mean
that each socioeconomic emission scenario could produce
a range of future methane abundances (Prather et al., 2012).
