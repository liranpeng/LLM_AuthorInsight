case, the simulations performed for the mean conditions in
the vicinity of “D” seem implausible. The challenge will be
to assess to what extent this reﬂects imprecision in the forc-
ing, of the sort that differentiates the different marked regions
in the ﬁgure.
Given a demonstration that ﬁne-scale models can quanti-
tatively represent the macro-structure of the observed clouds,
EUREC4A measurements are expected to provide bench-
marks for the simulation of cloud microphysical process.
