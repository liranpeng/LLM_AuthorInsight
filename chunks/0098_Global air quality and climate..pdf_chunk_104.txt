around 25%.262 Primary biogenic aerosols are emitted to the
atmosphere in the form of pollen, bacteria, spores, or plant
fragments,263–265 though knowledge is limited as to their
contribution to PM2.5 concentrations or how they will change
with climate.5
Individual aerosol species respond diﬀerently to meteoro-
logical changes. Rising temperature and water vapor enhance
SO2 oxidation relative to surface loss, increasing sulfate
aerosol but decreasing nitrate aerosol.241,242,248,266–269 One
