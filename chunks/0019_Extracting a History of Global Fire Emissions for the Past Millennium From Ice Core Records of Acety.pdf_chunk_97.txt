zone had the trace gas emission factor of savanna/grassland (which comprises about 67% of dry matter
burned today). These factors are lower than the GFED4 global weighted mean emission factor, which
Figure 5. Dry matter burned inferred from each gas record assuming all non‐boreal biomass burning emission resulted
from savanna/grasslands burning (all‐SAV; top row). Shaded regions and stars are same as in Figure 4.
