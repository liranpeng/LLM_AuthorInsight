2003) method selects both ICAs and spectral intervals ran-
domly in each grid square. Every spectral interval is sampled
only once, and each may have a different ICA selected ac-
cording to its fractional area (frequency of occurrence). With
100+ binâ€“ICA combinations, the ICAs are well sampled,
but there may be instances in which a few key large-energy
bins are not sampled accurately. The McICA approach, when
suitably averaged over time, has no mean bias in average
