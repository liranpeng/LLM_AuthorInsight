total emissions (Fig. 2). Bottom-up and top-down approaches indicate 
that Africa was the largest source of N2O in the last decade, followed 
by South America (Fig. 2). Bottom-up and top-down approaches agree 
well regarding the magnitudes and trends of N2O emissions from South 
Asia and Oceania (Extended Data Fig. 3j, l). For the remaining regions, 
bottom-up and top-down estimates are comparable in terms of trends 
but diverge when estimating the strengths of the sources. Clearly,
