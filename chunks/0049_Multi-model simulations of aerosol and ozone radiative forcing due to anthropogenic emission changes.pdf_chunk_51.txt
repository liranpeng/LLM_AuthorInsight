ing changes by +1 to +2 W m−2 over the south-eastern USA
and central Europe due to reduced abundances; it changes by
−0.5 to −1.5 W m−2 over most of southern and eastern Asia.
In other regions, the changes are minimal. The changes in the
direct aerosol effect of BC are smaller in magnitude and op-
posite in sign: as much as −0.3 W m−2 over the USA and Eu-
rope and as much as +0.3 to +1.0 W m−2 over a broad region
of the northern tropics and subtropics from Africa to eastern
