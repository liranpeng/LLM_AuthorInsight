that can help connect the observations to models and quantify the cloud albedo and rain 
susceptibilities, or how much the cloud albedo and rain vary as a function of droplet number 
and LWP (Terai et al., 2012; Painemal and Zuidema, 2013). Further, they can provide a 
geophysical constraint on lidar and radar-specific retrievals, such as a combination with the 
attenuation-corrected HCR reflectivity data to develop a simple Z-LWC relationship for 
Albrecht et al.
