functions of re and do not simply scale as total mass. For this
ﬁrst version of Solar-J, we made a simplifying assumption
and used the Mie code with the ice-water refractive index to
calculate SSA and Q as a function of re = 3, 6, 12, 24, 48,
96 µm using the liquid-water clouds’ C.1 distribution. Effec-
tively, we assumed that the ice particles were spheres. For the
phase function A0:7, we kept the two T-matrix results (irreg-
ular and hexagonal ice particles) and used them for all re of
