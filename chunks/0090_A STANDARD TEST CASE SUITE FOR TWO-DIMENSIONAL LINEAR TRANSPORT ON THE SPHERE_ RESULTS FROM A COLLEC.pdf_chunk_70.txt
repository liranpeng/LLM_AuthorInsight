Lin and Rood (1996) scheme is used in NCAR’s Com-
munity Atmosphere Model Finite-Volume version (CAM-
FV, Neale et al., 2010) and implemented on a regular
latitude–longitude grid. The transport scheme in CAM-FV
applies successive applications of ﬁrst-order advection and
PPM (piecewise parabolic method; Colella and Woodward,
1984) ﬂux-divergence operators that are carefully combined
to minimize splitting errors. To render CAM-FV, approxi-
mately shape-preserving slope limiters and curvature lim-
