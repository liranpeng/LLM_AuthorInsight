L-CH4 (ppb d−1) versus HCHO (ppt) for the three tropical
regions where most of the CH4 loss occurs. The relationship
is linear but with a lot of scatter and has slopes ranging from
3.5 to 4.4 per day over the three tropical regions, but for the
largest reactivities (0–4 km, 1–3 ppb d−1), L-CH4 is not so
well correlated with HCHO.
As is usual with new model intercomparison projects, we
have an opportunity to identify model “features” and iden-
