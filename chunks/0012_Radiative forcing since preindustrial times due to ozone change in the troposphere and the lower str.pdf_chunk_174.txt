bust and lies within the range of 7.9 DU to 13.8 DU, when
only chemical change is taken into account.
Among the
models that calculate chemical change in the stratosphere
(all models except STOCHEM HadGEM1, UM CAM, and
STOCHEM HadAM3) the range of tropospheric ozone
change is even narrower, lying between 7.9 DU to 9.8 DU.
In the calculations accounting for both chemical and cli-
mate change, the tropospheric ozone increase is in the range
8.9 DU to 10.8 DU among the CCMs with detailed tropo-
