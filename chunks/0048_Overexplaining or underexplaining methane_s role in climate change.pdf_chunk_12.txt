is missing from the 3D models.
The Bayesian models used in these new papers reduce the
available observations into hemispheric averages (24, 25), which
makes their complex statistical methods computationally tracta-
ble. However, the spatial distributions of methane, its isotopes,
and MCF may contain additional information that can distinguish
between the alternative scenarios and provide causal explana-
tions for the inferred OH trends. For example, 3D global atmo-
