1978; Xiao et al., 2007). The global acetylene budget is estimated at roughly
7 Tg yearâˆ’1 with about half of the emissions from biofuel burning and the
remaining half split equally between fossil fuel and biomass burning
(Xiao et al., 2007). Acetylene may also have a small source from partial
combustion of methane through geologic outgassing (i.e., mud volcanoes)
(Anderson, 1958; Gunter & Musgrave, 1971; Liu et al., 2017). This source
