by a layer that is stably stratiﬁed with respect to unsaturated,
but unstable with respect to saturated, convection. The typi-
cal ocean mixed layer was as impressively well mixed, but
over a layer about 10 times shallower. Here the measure-
ments document the peculiar situation of salinity maintaining
the stratiﬁcation that caps the downward growth of the ocean
mixed layer. Ship-based measurements of the air–sea inter-
face were greatly extended by 5 Saildrones, 3 wave gliders,
