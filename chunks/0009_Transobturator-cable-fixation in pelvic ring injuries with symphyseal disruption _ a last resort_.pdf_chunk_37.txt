female [14].
In our case series, the main indications for TOCF were revision surgery,
obesity, and impaired bone quality. TOCF might bring additional stability
in combination with symphyseal plating, which has not yet been proven
in biomechanical analysis. It might be that TOCF alone, without
symphyseal plating provides enough stability but this theory requires
further clinical evaluation [10]. In case#1 TOCF was combined with
