where un (n = 1:4) are the cosines of the zenith angles for the scattered intensity (I). The angles are Gauss 
points with weights wn. We assume a Lambertian reflective surface, and hence Iup(+un) is isotropic and de-
noted simply as Iup. The solution requires a linear equation relating Iup to the intensities at the four angles
