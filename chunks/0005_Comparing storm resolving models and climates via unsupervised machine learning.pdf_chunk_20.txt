structure so that the latent representation can be used to discover patterns in high-dimensional data. The tradeoff 
between both tasks is a manifestation of the rate-distortion tradeoff from information Â­theory22 and forms the 
basis for deciding on an architecture.
In order to facilitate the discovery of hidden structure in the latent space, we additionally cluster the embed-
ded data using k-means clustering. In machine learning terminology, such an approach is also called vector
