Initial conditions are the inﬁnitely smooth Gaussian hills, and the normalized error norms are computed at time t = T .
“optimal” convergence rates and will be discussed in sepa-
rate sections below.
3.1.1
Reaching asymptotic convergence
Together with the absolute errors that will be commented
on in the discussion of “minimal” resolution, perhaps the
most striking observation to be made regarding the con-
vergence plots (Figs. 1 and 2) is that models transition
