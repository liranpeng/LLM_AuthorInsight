AerChemMIP further aims to identify the patterns of change
in surface temperature and precipitation at the global and re-
gional levels associated with future NTCF mitigation efforts
focusing on air pollutant species. These experiments cover
the time frame from 2015 to 2055, as this is when reductions
in aerosol and ozone precursor emissions are expected to be
signiÔ¨Åcant, at least for some regions. The future scenarios
are based on Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) as de-
