tions to simplify the perturbation analysis and enable com-
parisons between CTMs, but these could alter τCH4×OH.
In particular, the simulations neglect variability in biogenic
VOC emissions (Guenther et al., 2006), trends in anthro-
pogenic emissions and their location, and trends in atmo-
spheric methane. We compare our GEOS-Chem/MERRA
simulation to an available GEOS-Chem simulation (M. Mu,
