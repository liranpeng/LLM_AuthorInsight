and 2. The schemes have been grouped according to imple-
mentation grid. An accompanying histogram (Fig. 3, middle)
depicts the convergence rate for ℓi, i = 2,∞. The ordering
of the data in the histogram will become clear as we discuss
“minimal” resolution in the next section. For the convergence
study the CN is held ﬁxed. The labels on the convergence
plots and histograms include the CN appended to the scheme
acronym.
The histogram graphically depicts the range of conver-
