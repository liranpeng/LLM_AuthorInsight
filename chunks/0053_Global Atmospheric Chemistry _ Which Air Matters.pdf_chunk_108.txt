transect representativeness is about as good as we can expect.
Thus, model–model differences comparing individual tran-
sects from each model would not be signiﬁcant unless they
exceed these percentages. Averaging over the basin and/or
several days should resolve model differences at ﬁner scales.
The day-to-day standard deviation for the mid-Paciﬁc aver-
ages in Table 2 is shown in percent; it is smaller than across
individual longitudinal transects for a given day; and in key
