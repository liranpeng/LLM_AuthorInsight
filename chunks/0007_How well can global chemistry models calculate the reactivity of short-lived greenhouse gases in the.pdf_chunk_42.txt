vs. L-CH4 relationship that seems counter to known chem-
istry in which both L-O3 and L-CH4 maximize with the high
HOX values in the warmer, wetter, lower troposphere of the
tropical Paciﬁc.

We examine the relationship between the three reactivities in
each model with scatter plots of P -O3 and L-CH4 against
L-O3 in Fig. 2. Each plot has 14 880 points (5-day parcel
means) and is split by location: 60–20◦S and 20–60◦N (extra
