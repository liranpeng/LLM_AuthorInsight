diagnostics were depicted as histograms. Doing that with
convergence rates showed no clear relationship between
1λm and numerical convergence rates. In fact some of the
lowest order schemes performed best with respect to 1λm.

Ability of the transport scheme to preserve
ﬁlaments
The ﬁlament diagnostic ℓf(τ) was introduced to quantify how
well thin ﬁlaments are preserved. This diagnostic requires the
ﬂow to be non-divergent since it relies on the fact that, for
