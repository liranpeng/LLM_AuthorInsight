the SSP3-7.0 scenario.
are calculated by comparing the change in net TOA ra-
diation ï¬‚uxes between two runs with the same prescribed
SSTs, but with NTCF emissions or WMGHG (methane,
nitrous oxide, halocarbon) concentrations perturbed from
their pre-industrial to present-day values. Internal variabil-
ity (mainly clouds) generates considerable interannual vari-
ability in ERFs; therefore, at least 30 years of simulation
are needed to characterise the present-day ERF from some
