measured at the ﬂight end. The aircraft ﬁrst visited the area of
the Gulf of Genoa where, because of no available AOD ob-
servations, the direct model run and the assimilation model
run show the same aerosol concentrations. The variability in
that part of the ﬂight is well simulated, with slightly higher
modelled aerosol concentrations at these heights than what
is measured. Later, on the way to Toulouse, with more avail-
able satellite observations, the assimilation model run low-
