poor-quality images with incoherent structures. This was surprising
because conditional diffusion models have been successfully applied
to super-resolution tasks in natural image restoration, as
demonstrated in works like52. We hypothesize that the significant
distribution shift between the input variables and challenging target
variables, particularly the radar reflectivity, necessitates high noise
levels during the forward process and numerous steps in the
