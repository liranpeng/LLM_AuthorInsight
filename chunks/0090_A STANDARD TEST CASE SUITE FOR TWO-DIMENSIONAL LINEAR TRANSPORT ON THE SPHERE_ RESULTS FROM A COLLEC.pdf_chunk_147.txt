which the ﬁlaments were resolved in the sense that asymp-
totic convergence is reached; for CSLAM-CN5.5 asymptotic
convergence with cosine bell initial conditions is reached at
approximately 1λ = 1.5◦for which ℓ2 ≈0.033. The mini-
mum resolution is estimated from a convergence plot (see
Fig. 4 in LSPT2012) and should be computed without and
(if applicable) with shape-preserving ﬁlters. The “minimal”
resolution used in the remainder of the test case suite should
be 1λm for the unlimited scheme.
