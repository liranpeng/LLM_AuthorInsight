tions 3.1 and 3.2 will present and discuss radiative forcing
calculations made by the University of Oslo radiative transfer
model based on tropospheric and stratospheric ozone change,
respectively. In order to allow for an estimate of the uncer-
tainty related to radiative transfer calculations, additional ra-
diative transfer models were invited to do the calculation.
Section 3.3 will deal with results from the University of
Reading and University of Lâ€™Aquila radiative transfer models
