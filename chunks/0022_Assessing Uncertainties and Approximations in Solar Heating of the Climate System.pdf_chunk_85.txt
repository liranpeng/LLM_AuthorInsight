Θ is the angle between incident and scattered light. Nominally, these phase functions are calculated using 
Mie theory for spherical droplets or other approximations for aspherical ice or dust particles (Mishchenko 
et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018) and expanded in Legendre polynomials, PL(Θ), where the first two terms are 
P0 ≡ 1 and P1 ≡ cos(Θ). See Figure 1 of LBYY for the Legendre coefficients for water clouds and dust. Del-
