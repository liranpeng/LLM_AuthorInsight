were observed during the CSET missions that captured the cloud system evolution in the 
Pacific trades. The cloud systems sampled included solid stratocumulus infused with smoke 
from Canadian wildfires, mesoscale (100-200 km) cloud-precipitation complexes, and 
patches of shallow cumuli in very clean environments. Ultra clean layers were observed 
frequently near the top of the boundary layer and were often associated with shallow, veil
