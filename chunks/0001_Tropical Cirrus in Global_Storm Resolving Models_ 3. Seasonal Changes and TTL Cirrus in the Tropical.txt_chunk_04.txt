40‐day simulation period than observed. While the models represent large‐scale tropical convection with some fidelity, large regional differences in cloud properties and top‐of‐atmosphere radiation fluxes exist. We focus on a region within the Tropical Western Pacific to study the small‐scale features available with the high spatiotemporal resolution of GSRMs. Most models that participated in both phases of DYAMOND capture the seasonal differences between the two phases, yet each model exhibits
