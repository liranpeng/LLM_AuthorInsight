of the extreme eastern Paciﬁc reactivities is seen in the statis-
tics generated from the central Paciﬁc values only (CPac;
gray circles); e.g., the mean value for L-O3 drops from 1.42
to 1.17 ppb d−1.
The ability to test a model’s reactivity statistics with the
ATom 10 s data is not obvious, but the PDs based on 1◦lat-
itude by 200 m altitude cells (the black Xs) are remarkably
close to the PDs based on 2 km (horizontal) by 80 m (vertical)
