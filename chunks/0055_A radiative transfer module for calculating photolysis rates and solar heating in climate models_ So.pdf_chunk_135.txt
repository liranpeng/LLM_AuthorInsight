culate is the total change of heating over the in-cloud layers.
As seen in Fig. 6, there is substantial clear-sky absorption by
atmospheric water vapor in the cloudy layers (∼100 W m−2)
at high sun. Thus, the small perturbation caused by the cloud
(< 10 %, third row) results from in-cloud heating of ice par-
ticles (proportional to τabs) countered by reduced heating of
the water vapor in the region because of the increased upward
scattered light (top row). The extreme case of the SZA of 84◦
