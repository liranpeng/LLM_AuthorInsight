between the minimum and the maximum values. The centre map shows the 
spatial distribution of 10-year average N2O emissions from land and ocean 
based on the land and ocean models. Per capita N2O emission (kg N per capita 
per year) during 2007–2016 is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. The map was 
created using ESRI ArcMap 10.4.1.
