regional DA, which for CWA is of similar computational cost as
running the operational numerical model (WRF) for 13â€‰h.
For such extensions, the two step approach in CorrDiff offers
practical advantages to reduce the amount of variance that must be
handled stochastically, and trade-off between the fast inference of
the mean using the UNet, and the probabilistic inference of the
CorrDiff. This is particularly useful given that some variables
