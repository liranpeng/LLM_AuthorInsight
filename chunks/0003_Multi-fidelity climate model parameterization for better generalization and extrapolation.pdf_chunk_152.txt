plots in figures 8.a-8.c). Hence, the MF-RPN model is capable of better extrapolating at relatively low and high altitude levels
within the troposphere (259 and 761 hPa) compared to mid altitude levels (around 494 hPa) as observed for the moisture
tendency.
It is worth noting that at vertical level 494 hPa, the LF-RPN model shows better results compared to the MF-RPN model in
