teristics of our system, we decided to keep the relative mass
contributions of all bins constant (24 bins including 6 size
bins of all 4 aerosol types). After the analysis increment is
calculated, it is repartitioned to the different bins in the model
according to their background fractions of the total aerosol
mass.
