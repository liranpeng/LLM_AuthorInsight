across different oceanic environments.
The richness of structure observed in the upper ocean dur-
ing EUREC4A can be quantiÔ¨Åed by the distribution of surface
temperature fronts. All seagoing platforms contributed to ob-
serving the upper-ocean temperature structure, surveying a
wide region and a large spectrum of ocean scales, and thus
can contribute to this measure of upper-ocean variability. An
example from one such platform, a Saildrone, is shown in
