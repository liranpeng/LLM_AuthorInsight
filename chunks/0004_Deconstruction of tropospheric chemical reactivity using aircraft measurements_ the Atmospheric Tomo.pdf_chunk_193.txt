order any feedbacks on the chemistry caused by changes in
CO or C2H6 or CH4. Other longer-chain alkanes might read-
just in 10–30 d to the new levels of O3, but these species are
not very important for the ATom oceanic ﬂights. Thus, our
24 h sensitivity calculations should be adequate for deriving
the timescale for decay of an O3 perturbation.

CH4 lifetime feedback
A positive perturbation to the CH4 abundance reduces tropo-
spheric OH and thus increases the timescale of the perturba-
