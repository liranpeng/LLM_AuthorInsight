to achieve equal latitude-by-pressure sampling by weight-
ing each ATom parcel inversely according to the number of
parcels in each 10â—¦latitude by 100 hPa bin, and each point is
also cosine (latitude)-weighted. We calculate the means and
medians plus the percent of total reactivity in the top 10 % of
the weighted parcels (Table 2) and also the mean reactivity
of the top 10 %, percent of total reactivity in the top 50 %,
10 %, and 3 %, plus the mean J values (Table S8).
