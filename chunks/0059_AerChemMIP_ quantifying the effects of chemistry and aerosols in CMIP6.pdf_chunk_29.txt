forcings were diagnosed using a mixture of ofﬂine radia-
tive transfer models and double-call diagnostics, whereby a
model radiation scheme is called twice, with the second call
containing one or all radiative species set to ﬁxed values.
The historical and future climate effects of ozone de-
pletion were ﬁrst addressed in multi-model studies using
CTMs in ACCENT (Gauss et al., 2006; Forster et al., 2007),
focussing on changes in global radiative forcing. Son et
