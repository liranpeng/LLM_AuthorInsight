multiple, separate species in some models or may be lumped
according to their reaction rates. The abovementioned list
tends to be inclusive because, for much of the troposphere,
a smaller list can apply. For some species (e.g., C5H8), their
role is key only if they are present in large enough abun-
dances, but even when sampling across the Paciﬁc Ocean
basin one may ﬁnd plumes with recent biospheric sources.
This simpliﬁcation of the chemical system fails in regions
