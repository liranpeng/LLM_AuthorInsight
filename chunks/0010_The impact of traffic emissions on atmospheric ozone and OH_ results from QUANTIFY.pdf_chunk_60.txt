heterogeneous reaction on sulphuric acid aerosol. The model
chemistry uses the atmospheric chemistry integration pack-
age ASAD (Carver et al., 1997) and is integrated with the
IMPACT scheme of Carver and Scott (2000). The ozone and
nitrogen oxide concentrations at the top model level are con-
strained to zonal mean values calculated by the Cambridge
2D model (Law and Nisbet, 1996). The chemical rate coef-
Ô¨Åcients used by p-TOMCAT have been recently updated to
