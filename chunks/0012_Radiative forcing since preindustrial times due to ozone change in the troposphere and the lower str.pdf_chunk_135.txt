the stratospheric ozone depletion of the last few decades and
the resulting reductions in downward transport.
Radiative forcing depends strongly on the vertical distri-
bution of the modeled ozone change. Differences with re-
spect to the height distribution of ozone change will thus
add to the differences between the horizontal patterns seen in
Fig. 6 and the horizontal distribution of total ozone change
(not shown). However, in conclusion it can be said that there
