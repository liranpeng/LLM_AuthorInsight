serves most of the variability. Lines in Fig. S2 demark 400 m
in altitude, and most of the variability occurs on this larger,
model-resolved scale. Figure S2b shows the 10 s reactivities
during that descent and also indicates that much of the vari-
ability occurs at 400 m vertical scales. A more quantitative
example using all the tropical ATom reactivities is shown in
comparisons with probability densities below (Fig. 5).
How important is it for the models to represent the ex-
