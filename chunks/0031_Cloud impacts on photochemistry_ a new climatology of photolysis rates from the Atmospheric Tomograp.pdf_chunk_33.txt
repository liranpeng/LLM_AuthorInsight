tional cloud cover within a grid cell and thus partial over-
lap of clouds in each column (Morcrette and Fouquart, 1986;
Briegleb, 1992; Hogan and Illingworth, 2000). This approach
later moved on to chemistry models (Feng et al., 2004; Liu et
al., 2006; Neu et al., 2007). Monte Carlo solutions for the nu-
merous independent column atmospheres generated by cloud
overlap were developed for solar heating (MCICA; Pincus et
al., 2003), but random, irreproducible noise was not accept-
