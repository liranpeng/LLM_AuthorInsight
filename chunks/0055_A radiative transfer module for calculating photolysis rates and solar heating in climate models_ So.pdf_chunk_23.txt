adopts all RRTMG’s bands longwards of 778 nm (see text for details).
RRTMG-SW. Section 4 examines computational costs for
Solar-J and options for optimization. Conclusions and a path
forward are discussed in Sect. 5.

Methods: model conﬁguration and test cases
2.1
Solar-J spectral conﬁguration
The 18 bins of Cloud-J make up the ﬁrst 18 bins of Solar-
J and were optimized for calculating photolysis rates below
64 km (Wild et al., 2000; Bian and Prather, 2002). The ﬁrst
