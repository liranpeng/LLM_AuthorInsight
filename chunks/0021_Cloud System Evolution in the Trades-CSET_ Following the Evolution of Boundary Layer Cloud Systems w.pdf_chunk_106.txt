description of the evolution of the clouds and boundary layer structures in the North Pacific 
Trades. Although there was variability on the different days, a common feature was that on 
the outbound flights the boundary layer was already showing signs of decoupling in the 
initial sampling areas associated with stratocumulus clouds around 140W . These decoupled 
stratocumulus areas were followed by areas that were dominated by mesoscale cloud
