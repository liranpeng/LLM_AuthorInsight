Our work suggests the need to further investigate the parameterization choices in these high-resolution 
simulations. In the DYAMOND initiative, ICON was configured at an unusually high resolution (grid-cell 
dimension of  2 km) so that typical sub-grid orography and convection parameterizations were ­deactivated45. 
In the design of both SPCAM and SAM, there are approximations required for the anelastic formulations of
