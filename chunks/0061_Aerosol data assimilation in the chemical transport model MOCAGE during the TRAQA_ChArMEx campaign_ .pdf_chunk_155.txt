could modify the size distribution in the model. To achieve
this in the system, it would be necessary to study the rela-
tionship and sensitivity between the size and bin distribution
in MOCAGE and the aerosol Ångstrom exponent obtained
from multi-wavelength measurements.
If we want to introduce direct information of the vertical
proﬁle from observations into the model, we would need to
