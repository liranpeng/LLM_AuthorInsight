(e.g., Â±4% maximum range)? Basically, the MCF decay rate can
be perturbed by (i) a change in the globally integrated concen-
tration of OH times the reaction rate (a sensitive function of tem-
perature), (ii) continuing emissions of MCF, and (iii) large-scale
redistribution of mass of MCF by atmospheric transport.
For i, a shift in the mean tropical temperatures (where most
MCF and methane is destroyed) or a shift in the 4D correlation of
