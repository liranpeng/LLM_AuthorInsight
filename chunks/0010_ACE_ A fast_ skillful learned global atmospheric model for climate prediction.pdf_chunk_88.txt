done in [16]. First the standard scaling mean and standard deviations are computed over time, latitude
and longitude, without area weighting:
µ(a) = mean
t,ϕ,λ a(t, ϕ, λ)
(9)
σ(a) = std
t,ϕ,λa(t, ϕ, λ).
(10)
The “full-field” normalization (as in [16]) is defined as aff = (a −µ(a))/σ(a). Some prognostic
variables, for example surface pressure ps, vary more strongly over space than over time, so their
