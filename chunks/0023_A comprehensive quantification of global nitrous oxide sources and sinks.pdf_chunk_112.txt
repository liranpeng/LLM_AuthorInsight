all possible sources and all global change processes that can perturb 
the budget. A total of 18 sources and three sinks of N2O are identified 
and grouped into six categories (Fig. 1, Table 1): (1) natural fluxes in the 
absence of climate change and anthropogenic disturbances including 
soil emissions, surface sink, ocean emissions, lightning and atmos-
pheric production, and natural emission from inland waters, estuar-
ies, coastal zones (inland and coastal waters); (2) perturbed fluxes
