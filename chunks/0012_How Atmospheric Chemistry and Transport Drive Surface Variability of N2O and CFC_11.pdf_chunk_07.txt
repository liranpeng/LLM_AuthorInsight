Plain Language Summaryâ€‚ Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a long-lived greenhouse gas that drives 
climate change and ozone depletion, posing a threat to society's health and well-being. The abundance 
of N2O at Earth's surface, where we can measure it most precisely, fluctuates over seasons and years 
due to increasing human emissions, variable natural emissions, varying stratospheric destruction, and 
the movement of air throughout the atmosphere. Scientists use these fluctuations to separate natural
