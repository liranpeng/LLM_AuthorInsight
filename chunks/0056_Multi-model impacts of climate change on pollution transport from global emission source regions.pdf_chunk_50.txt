mid-latitudes, CO-tracer mixing ratios are largest in boreal
spring and in the southern mid-latitudes in boreal autumn.
Elsewhere CO-tracer mixing ratios have a fairly uniform sea-
sonal cycle.
During winter, large CO-tracer mixing ratios are found
near the Equator, with decadal-average values of more than
60 ppb extending from the surface to âˆ¼700 hPa and up to
40 ppb in the mid-upper tropical troposphere in all four
CCMs (Fig. 2). In summer, CO-tracer mixing ratios are lower
