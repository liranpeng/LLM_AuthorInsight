addition, the CAFS data do not represent a true climatology
due to ﬂight planning and ﬂight operations that tend to avoid
strong convective features and thick cloud decks, particularly
near the surface. Such biases can shift the distribution as well
as widen it through noise, and this may explain some of the
increased width of the CAFS peak and the 1 to 2 % offsets of
the clear-sky peaks in Fig. 4. It is difﬁcult to select between
Group 1 and 2 using CAFS. The CAFS clear-sky fraction
