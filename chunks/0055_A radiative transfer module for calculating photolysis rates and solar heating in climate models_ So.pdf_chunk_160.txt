tational cost is clearly driven by the additional 82 infrared
bins adopted from RRTMG-SW. Alternative methods of pa-
rameterizing these infrared bins need to be examined: e.g.,
14 bins (Chou, 1992; Grant and Grossman, 1998), 34 bins
(Fu and Liou, 1992), and 36 bins (Cole, 2005). Any of these
would result in 1.5â€“2.5 times more savings for Solar-J. We
recognize that the infrared bins adopted in RRTMG-SW are
based on accurate representation of the line-by-line calcula-
