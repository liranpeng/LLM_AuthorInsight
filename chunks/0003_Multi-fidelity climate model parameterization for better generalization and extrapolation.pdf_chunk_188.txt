provides more accurate uncertainty estimates. It is worth emphasizing again that the quantified uncertainty ÏƒM is estimated
only based on the parameterization input without any knowledge of the true target value. Therefore, an accurate uncertainty
quantification is a powerful tool, which can inform on how accurate the surrogate model is. This characteristic can be seen as
similar to a-posteriori error estimates in model order reduction techniques.
