or pastures21,76. Using these two curves and the baseline, we kept track 
of the N2O reduction of tropical forests and the post-deforestation 
crop/pasture N2O emissions at an annual timescale. This book-keeping 
method was applied to the two deforestation area datasets (Supple-
mentary Information sectionÂ 2.8), so we could investigate not only the 
difference caused by the two sets of land use data but also the difference 
between this empirical method and the process-based model. For land
