simulate the meteorological conditions (TM4, p-TOMCAT,
OsloCTM2 and UCI). The other two models are coupled
CCMs (chemistry climate models). LMDzINCA was nudged
to the operational ECMWF Ô¨Åelds whereas E39/C was oper-
ated as a climate model. Some general properties of the mod-
els are listed in Tab. 4. Except for E39/C all models included
explicit NMHC chemistry. The TM4 uses a Carbon Bond
Mechanism reaction scheme (CBM4) not including acetone
