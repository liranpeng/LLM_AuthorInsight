(( ¯S)yr for the 10-events-per-year case) is computed from Eq. (6) after the clustering algorithm that couples nearest neighbors and successive
days, with units of 104 km squared days (km2d), where 104 km2 is about a 1◦× 1◦grid cell. Average summertime (JJA) MDA8 O3 (ppb)
from the grid-interpolated data (grid) is area weighted, but the station average (station) is raw with all stations equally weighted. The mean
