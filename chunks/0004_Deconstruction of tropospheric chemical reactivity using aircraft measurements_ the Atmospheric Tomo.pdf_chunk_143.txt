ﬁrst day. Almost all the changes from v2b to v3 are negative.
P-O3 has, as expected, the largest changes for ATom-3 Pa-
ciﬁc and ATom-2 Atlantic. Here the median decrease (−13 %
and −16 %, respectively) is twice as large as the mean, im-
plying a large shift in the mid-level values of P-O3. The re-
maining changes in the mean reactivities are small, 0 % to
−3 %.
Vertical proﬁles of the four mean reactivities are shown in
