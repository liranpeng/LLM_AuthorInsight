Ø. Hodnebrog et al.: Future impact of trafﬁc emissions
Table 4. Radiative forcings (mW m−2) from changes in ozone, methane (including stratospheric water vapour), and methane-induced ozone
(O3(CH4)) for different transport sectors and years given as ensemble means and standard deviations. Note that the history of emissions has
been taken into account (see text for details), and that the fully scaled perturbations were used.
