face albedo and atmospheric mass). Two chemistry-climate
models (GFDL, NCAR) were unable to completely overwrite
the modeled T and q values with data stream values (see sen-
sitivity tests below). See also Supplement for additional de-
tails.
Implications for reactivities are discussed below. It is dif-
ﬁcult, if not impossible, to specify 24 h cloud ﬁelds, from
observations or a model, in a way that all models here could
implement consistently. Treatment of photolysis rates in uni-
