aerosols, the INCA model simulates the distribution of aerosols with anthropogenic
sources such as sulfates, nitrates, black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), as well
as natural aerosols such as sea salt and dust. The heterogeneous reactions on both
natural and anthropogenic tropospheric aerosols are included in the model60,61,67.
Ammonia and nitrates aerosols are considered as described by Hauglustaine
