estimates. When adopting the future A1B_HIGH estimates, a clear
signature on air quality can be detected. The Middle East is the
region which exhibits the worst air quality, closely followed by Asia.
For these regions the area of exceedence (ER > 1.0) for 2025 is
w40% and w25% of the total area of each region, respectively.
Comparing simulations employing the various scenarios shows
