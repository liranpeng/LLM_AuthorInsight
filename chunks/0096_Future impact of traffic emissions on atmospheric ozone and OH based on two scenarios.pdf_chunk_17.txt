9.14 Gt C (Peters et al., 2012), indicating that the emission
activity so far is closer to the evolution of the high A1B sce-
nario (9.68 Gt C), which is the focus of this study (for O3
precursors), than to the low B1 scenario (8.50 Gt C), which
was studied in H2011. Due to the assumptions of a rapid de-
cline in ROAD emissions under the B1 scenario, this sector
was not investigated speciÔ¨Åcally in H2011 but has been in-
cluded for the A1B scenario in this study. Until recently, the
