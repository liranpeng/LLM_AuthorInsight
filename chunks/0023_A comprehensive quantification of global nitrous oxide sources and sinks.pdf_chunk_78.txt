sources and sinks. Each of the past four decades has had higher global 
N2O emissions than the last, and overall, agricultural activities have 
dominated the growth in emissions. Total industrial emissions have 
been quite stable, with increased emissions from the fossil fuel sector 
offset to some extent by the decline in emissions in other industrial 
sectors as a result of successful abatement policies. We also highlight a 
number of complex interactions between N2O fluxes and human-driven
