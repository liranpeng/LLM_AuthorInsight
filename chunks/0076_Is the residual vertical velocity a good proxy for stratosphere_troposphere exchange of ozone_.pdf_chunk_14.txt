(see Prather et al. [2008] for advection errors due to ﬁnite resolution). Likewise, for the LS method, the inte-
grated hemispheric ﬂuxes can be accurately calculated. Small diﬀerences can be attributed to the upward
O3 ﬂuxes at the tropical tropopause, which are not enclosed by the LMS domain. The LMS mass tendency
term (the so-called “breathing” of the LMS; also noted as dM∕dtLMS later) is important for the seasonal cycle
