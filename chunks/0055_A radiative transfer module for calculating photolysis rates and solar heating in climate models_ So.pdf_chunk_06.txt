length integration, scattering, and averaging over cloud ﬁelds
– all have comparably small errors. More accurate solutions
with Solar-J come with increased computational costs, about
5 times that of RRTMG-SW for a single atmosphere. There
are options for reduced costs or computational acceleration
that would bring costs down while maintaining improved ﬁ-
delity and balanced errors.

A major challenge in simulating the Earth’s climate is the
