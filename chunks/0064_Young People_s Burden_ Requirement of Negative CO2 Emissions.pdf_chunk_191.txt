and thus avoid amplifying GHG feedbacks.

Aerosols and purposeful climate intervention
Human-made aerosols today are believed to cause a large, al-
beit poorly measured, negative climate forcing (Fig. 4) of the
order of −1 W m−2 with uncertainty of at least 0.5 W m−2
(Fig. 7.19, Boucher et al., 2013). Fossil fuel burning is only
one of several human-caused aerosol sources (Boucher et al.,
2013). Given that human population continues to grow, and
