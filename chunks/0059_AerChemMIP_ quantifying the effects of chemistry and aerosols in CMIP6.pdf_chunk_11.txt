2015). These adjustments are in principle independent of sur-
face temperature changes (although in practical model con-
ﬁgurations the land surface temperature will also respond).
The contribution of such rapid adjustments to the change in
Earth’s energy budget following a perturbation of a radia-
tively active species can be incorporated into an effective ra-
diative forcing (ERF) (Myhre et al., 2013a; Boucher et al.,
2013; Sherwood et al., 2015), which has been shown to be a
