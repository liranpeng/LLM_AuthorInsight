ity for each deployment, these probability densities are quite
similar and provide a robust test for the modeled distribution
of species and reaction rates. For example, the 30◦S–30◦N
tropical distributions of O3, CO, and relative humidity are
distinct between the Paciﬁc and Atlantic (higher values of
both) but similar for each deployment in each basin. On the
other hand, the eastern Paciﬁc transect (0–30◦N, 121◦W) is
very different for each deployment. The compelling statistics
