els should use their own schemes for natural emissions. The
WMGHGs (methane, nitrous oxide, halocarbons) will be
speciﬁed as CMIP-speciﬁed concentrations, either through-
out the troposphere or at the surface.
We also realise that valuable contributions to answering
the AerChemMIP scientiﬁc questions can be made by groups
unable to participate in CMIP6, such as those running ofﬂine
CTMs. Participation from these groups is welcomed and en-
couraged in the wider Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative
