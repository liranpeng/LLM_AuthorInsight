Another consequence of this study is the extremely tight correlation of the interannual surface variations 
in F11 with those of N2O found in both models. With this relationship, it is possible to use the observed 
interannual N2O variations to remove the stratospheric influence on F11 and deduce its changing emis-
sions. Interannual variations in N2O emissions will certainly disrupt this tight relationship, but based on
