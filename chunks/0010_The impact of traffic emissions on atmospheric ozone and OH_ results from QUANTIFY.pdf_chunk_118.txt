Fig. 10. Mean OH perturbation (5% trafﬁc emission reduction) in the boundary layer during January (left) and July (right) between 800-
1000 hPa for road- (top) and ship emissions (middle). The effect of aircraft emissions is displayed for 200–300 hPa (bottom).

tude band from 40◦S to 30◦N. Since the OH concentrations
are globally highest in these regions, a (scaled) increase by
