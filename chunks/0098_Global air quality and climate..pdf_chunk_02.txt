meteorology that inï¬‚uence air pollution. We review the implications of projected changes in
methane (CH4), ozone precursors (O3), and aerosols for climate (expressed in terms of the
radiative forcing metric or changes in global surface temperature) and hemispheric-to-continental
scale air quality. Reducing the O3 precursor CH4 would slow near-term warming by decreasing
both CH4 and tropospheric O3. Uncertainty remains as to the net climate forcing from
