pointing up using the technique proposed by Oâ€™Connor et al. (2005). For optically thin 
clouds that were detected by both the HCR and the HSRL, the cloud drop size distributions 
were also retrieved (see Wood et al, 2018 for an example from a CSET flight).
When the aircraft was flying above the MBL in surveying mode (at a flight level of ~6 km), 
the HCR and HSRL were operated pointing downwards to observe MBL cloud and aerosol
