enging modules must be turned off because in many mod-
els the scavenging depends on the vertical distribution of the
species.
In this A-mode, the remaining connection of the reactivity
calculation with neighboring grid cells is through the pho-
tolysis rates, which require proﬁles of clouds, aerosol layers,
and ozone. It is impossible to prescribe all these data over
the diurnal cycle for each parcel from observations, and thus
we must rely on the CTM–CCM to generate a suitably re-
