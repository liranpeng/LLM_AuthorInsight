the direct model, differences between the model and the ob-
servations appear because of different model uncertainties,
including simpliﬁed and neglected processes. However, the
differences do not have a constant or cumulative nature; the
model sometimes overestimates or underestimates AOD. To
take into account these uncertainties in the assimilation pro-
cess, we deﬁned the variances in the matrix B in such a way
that it allows a margin for the background errors (Talagrand,
