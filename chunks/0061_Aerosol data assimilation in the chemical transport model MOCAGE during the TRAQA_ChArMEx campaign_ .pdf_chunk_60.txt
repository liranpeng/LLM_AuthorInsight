MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth Collection C051 retrievals at
550 nm from Terra and Aqua, the ocean product retrieved
with the “best solution” and the reﬂectance-corrected land
product. Their predicted uncertainties are 1τ = ±(0.03 +
0.05τ) over oceans and 1τ = ±(0.05+0.15τ) over land (Re-
mer et al., 2005). Over bright desert areas, we use the “Deep
Blue” MODIS product (Hsu et al., 2006). For the assimila-
