Figure 3 illustrates the variability of the generated radar reflectivity
field on four separate dates corresponding to distinct Taiwanese
weather events. Two dates are chosen randomly (Fig. 3e–l). The
other two correspond to dates where coherent events such as
typhoon (Fig. 3a–d) and frontal event (Fig. 3m–p) are present; these
dates are further analyzed in the following sections and more
examples of both of these phenomena are provided in the
