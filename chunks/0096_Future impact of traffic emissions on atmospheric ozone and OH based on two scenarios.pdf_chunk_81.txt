As for O3 RF, the RF due to CH4 and CH4-induced O3
will be stronger for AIR and SHIP, and weaker for ROAD in
the period from 2025 to 2050 (Table 4). The resulting net RF
shows that the positive O3 term will dominate for AIR in the
future, and will also strengthen between 2025 and 2050. For
SHIP, the cooling terms of RF due to CH4 and CH4-induced
O3 changes will dominate and also strengthen over the same
period. ROAD yielded the largest positive net RF of the three
