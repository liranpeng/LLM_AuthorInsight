mostly retains the same climate state and climate sensitivity
as the previous version, and we recommend its use for other
climate models that still use ozone climatologies.

Introduction
Accurate simulation of past climate evolution and projections
of future climate rely on correct representation of the green-
house gases (GHGs), including ozone. Simulating climate
change driven by ozone is challenging for chemistry trans-
