from nine GSRMs from the DYAMOND initiative, focusing on the second phase of DYAMOND that simulated a period in January–February 2020. This paper is the third in a series investigating tropical cirrus clouds in GSRMs using DYAMOND model output for an intercomparison. In the tropics, models capture the mean outgoing longwave radiation within −5 to 14 W m−2 of observed climatology, though most models have more convective precipitation over the 40‐day simulation period than observed. While the
