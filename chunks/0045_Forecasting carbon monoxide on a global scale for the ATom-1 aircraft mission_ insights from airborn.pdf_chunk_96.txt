values are also below the median over New Zealand and
the eastern and central tropical PaciÔ¨Åc, but the relatively low
variability of these regions makes this less of a concern for
the representativeness of the ATom measurements. The IAV
of these regions is larger for the MOPITT 700 hPa level, and
2016 lies slightly below the 25th percentile for this level.
The regionally averaged 500 nm AOT from MODIS
(Fig. 11) shows similar features to the MOPITT column. The
