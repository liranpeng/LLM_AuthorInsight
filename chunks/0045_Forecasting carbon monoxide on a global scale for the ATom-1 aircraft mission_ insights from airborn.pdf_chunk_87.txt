(variability relative to the mean) is smaller than for the other
regions (Fig. 9b). Similarly, the IAV in the MOPITT CO col-
umn and 700 hPa level over the tropical Atlantic is smaller
than that of the North Atlantic and Alaska regions. Although
the variability of CO over the tropical Atlantic is relatively
small, the MOPITT CO column shows a statistically signiﬁ-
cant anti-correlation between the MOPITT CO column over
the tropical Atlantic and the MEI (r = −0.52). This relation-
