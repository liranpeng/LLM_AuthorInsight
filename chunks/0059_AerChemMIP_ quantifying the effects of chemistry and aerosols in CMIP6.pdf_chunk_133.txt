ity, and Evaluation of model performance. Considerable ex-
perience has been gained in previous model intercompari-
son exercises (namely CCMVal, CCMI, AeroCom, ACCMIP,
and Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP)), but all
too often model versions were different from those used in
CMIP. AerChemMIP provides a unique opportunity to gener-
ate a complete dataset, requested directly from those GCMs
providing climate sensitivity and scenario information to
