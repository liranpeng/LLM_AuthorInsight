mid-latitudes in summer when the mid-latitude jet streams
are strongest, but their vertical extent is shallower than in the
tropics. Substantial differences of a factor of 2–3 in annual-
mean zonal convective mass ﬂuxes simulated across three
models (including STOC-HadAM3) were also reported in
Doherty et al. (2005). Since the same parameterisation is
used by UM-CAM, HadAM3, and GISS-ER-2, it may be
