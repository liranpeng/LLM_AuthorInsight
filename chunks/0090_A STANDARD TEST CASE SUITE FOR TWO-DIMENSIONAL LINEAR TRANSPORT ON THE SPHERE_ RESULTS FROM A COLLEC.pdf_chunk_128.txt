Fig. 1. Convergence plots for ℓ2 (ﬁrst and third rows) and ℓ∞(second and fourth rows) for the unlimited (ﬁrst column) and shape-preserving
(second column) versions of schemes based on cubed-sphere and two-patch grids. Optimal convergence rates are based on linear least-square
regressions to this data. Thin grey lines on each plot show slopes of second- and third-order convergence (top and bottom, respectively).
