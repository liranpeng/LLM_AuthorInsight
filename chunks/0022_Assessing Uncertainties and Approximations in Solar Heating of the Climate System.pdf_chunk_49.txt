region that covers the visible, UVA, and part of UVB (for convenience designated as UV-VIS here) we try to 
understand these differences.
This UV-VIS region has the most solar flux (721 W m−2) and for the most part is optically thin. The primary 
attenuators (molecular Rayleigh, O3), solar flux, and wavelength bands used in RRTMG and SJ are shown 
in Figure 2. For 298–320 nm (13 W m−2) the O3 total optical depth is greater than about 0.5 (0.05 in the
