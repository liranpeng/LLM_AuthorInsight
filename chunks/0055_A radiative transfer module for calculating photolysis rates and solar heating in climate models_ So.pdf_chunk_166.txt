of Solar-J is 5 times that of RRTMG-SW for a single atmo-
sphere, and if the cloud quadrature scheme for overlapping
cloud Ô¨Åelds (Neu et al., 2007; Prather, 2015) is applied to ei-
ther code, the cost increases additionally by 2.8 times. We
show that Solar-J can be optimized on GPUs and achieve
speeds similar to RRTMG-SW. While this opens up great
opportunities for the new generation of high-performance
computers, it also complicates the simple implementation of
Solar-J in a climate model.
