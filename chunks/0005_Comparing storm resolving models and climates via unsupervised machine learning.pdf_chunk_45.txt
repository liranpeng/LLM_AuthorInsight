proportions and identify the dominant convection types in each region (see Fig.Â S11).
When we examine the latent space of SPCAM, we again three distinct regimes of convection. The first mode 
corresponds to deep convection over the Pacific Warm pool, almost identical to the other GSRMs. A second 
mode of shallow convection dominates over areas where air is descending, both over continents and the oceans.
