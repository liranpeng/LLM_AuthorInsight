also allow the possibility of actions to limit the climate re-
sponse by reducing human-caused climate forcing in coming
years and decades. Second, the response time itself depends
on how strongly the system is being forced; speciﬁcally, the
response might be much delayed with a weaker forcing.
For example, studies suggesting multi-meter sea level rise
in a century assume continued high fossil fuel emissions this
century (Hansen et al., 2016) or at least a 2 ◦C SST increase
