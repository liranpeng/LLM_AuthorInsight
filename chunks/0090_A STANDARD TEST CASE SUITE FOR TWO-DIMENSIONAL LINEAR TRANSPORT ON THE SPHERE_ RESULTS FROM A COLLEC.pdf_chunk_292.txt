described in Skamarock and Gassmann (2011) implemented
on spherical centroidal Voronoi meshes (Ringler et al., 2011).
The meshes used in these tests are generated by subdividing
icosahedral meshes. That is, the Voronoi meshes are com-
posed of hexagons plus 12 pentagons. The scheme uses
a third-order Runge–Kutta time integration scheme and a
ﬁnite-volume ﬂux divergence calculation using Eq. (11) in
Skamarock and Gassmann (2011) with the upwinding pa-
