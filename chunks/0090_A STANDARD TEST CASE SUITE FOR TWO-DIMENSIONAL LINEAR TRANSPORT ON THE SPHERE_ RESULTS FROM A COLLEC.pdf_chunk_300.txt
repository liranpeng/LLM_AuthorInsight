triangular grid. Indeed the cell-averaged value of a function
is a second-order accurate approximation of its point-wise
value taken at the cell centroid. This motivates one to employ
some grid adjustment or grid optimization to design higher
order ﬁnite volume schemes. Instead of using any sophisti-
cated optimization (for instance spring dynamics or Lloyd’s
algorithm), we use centroids of the grid cells as our compu-
tational points and adjust the triangular mesh accordingly. In
