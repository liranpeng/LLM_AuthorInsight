parametric, distribution free, does not require normality, and
it is more sensitive to differences in the tails of the distribu-
tion than the widely used Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test (Eng-
mann and Cousineau, 2011). We compare the distributions
in Fig. 11 for episodes larger than 10 × 104 km2-days (10 to
16 connected grid cells) since we are mostly interested in the
largest episodes and, further, more than 90 % of the events
are in episodes of size greater than this. For the US, the CTM
