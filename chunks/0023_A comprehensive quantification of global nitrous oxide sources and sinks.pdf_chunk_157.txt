biogeochemical processes in soils (for example, biological nitrogen 
fixation, nitrification/denitrification, mineralization/immobilization, 
etc.)93, some missing processes such as freeze–thaw cycles and ecosys-
tem disturbances should be included in terrestrial biosphere models 
to reduce uncertainties. Second, the quality of input datasets—specifi-
cally the amount and timing of nitrogen application, and spatial and 
temporal changes in distribution of natural vegetation and agricultural
