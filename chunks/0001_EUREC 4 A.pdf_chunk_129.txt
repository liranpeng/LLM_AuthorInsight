ing this structure. A speciﬁc question that EUREC4A aims to
answer is the importance of downdrafts, and associated cold
pools (Rauber et al., 2007; Zuidema et al., 2012), in inﬂuenc-
ing boundary layer thermodynamic structure and momentum
transport to the surface. A related question is whether the
links between the cloud and sub-cloud layer depend on the
patterns of convective organization, for instance as a result
of differences in the circulation systems that may accompany
such patterns.
