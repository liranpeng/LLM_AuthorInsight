sis of O3 and CH4 RF estimated from this study, H2011,
and Myhre et al. (2011) to give a consistent set of results
from all six models, all three transport sectors, and all sce-
narios, including present-day (year 2000). Such a compari-
son is particularly useful when considering mitigation mea-
sures, and, since a consistent set of models has been used,
differences between scenarios are mostly governed by dif-
ferences in emission scenarios rather than disagreements be-
tween models.
