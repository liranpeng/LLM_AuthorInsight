Fig. 5 shows projected annual mean surface O3 changes over
the 21st century for selected world regions with the current
generation of chemistry–climate models using the RCP trajec-
tories. Large inter-annual variations are evident, reﬂecting
model-generated climate variability, with larger variability
over smaller regions, as well as within speciﬁc seasons, and
in the frequency of high-O3 events (not shown). The models
