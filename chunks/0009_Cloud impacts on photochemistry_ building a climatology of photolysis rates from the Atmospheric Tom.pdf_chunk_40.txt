Cloud-J v7.3, single-column,
Briegleb averaging
Cloud data include cloud fraction (CF), in-cloud ice/liquid water path and effective radius, or in-cloud ice/liquid optical depth (OD in the visible).
a Fast-J versions here are based on Bian and Prather (2002) with updates, including standard tables for cloud optical properties and simpliÔ¨Åed estimate of effective radius. Cloud
C1 refers to Deirmendjian liquid cloud size distribution from the Fast-J data tables (Wild et al., 2000).
