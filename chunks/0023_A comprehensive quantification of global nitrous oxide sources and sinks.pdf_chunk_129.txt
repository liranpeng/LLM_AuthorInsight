Emissions from a combination of fossil fuel and industry, waste and 
waste water, and biomass burning increased from 1.8 (1.6–2.1) Tg N yr−1 
in the 1980s to 1.9 (1.6–2.3) Tg N yr−1 over the period 2007–2016 (Table 1). 
The waste and waste water emission showed a continuous increase at a 
rate of 0.04 ± 0.01 Tg N yr−1 per decade (P < 0.05) (Extended Data Fig. 5c).
