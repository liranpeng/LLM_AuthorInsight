por, stratospheric ozone column, convective ﬂuxes, cloud op-
tical depth, biomass burning emissions, and anthropogenic
emissions. Perturbation magnitudes are chosen to be similar
to the interannual variability or decadal trend of each vari-
able (exact magnitudes in Table S2). Perturbations are ap-
plied globally, except for stratospheric ozone, which is only
perturbed over 40◦S–40◦N, where tropospheric OH produc-
tion from UV photolysis of tropospheric O3 occurs. The con-
