Figure 69. Sensitivity of CH4 loss with respect to its abundance
(dln[L-CH4]/dln[CH4], in percentage per percentage) vs. loss rate
(L-CH4, in parts per billion per day) for parcels in ATom-1. All
ATom-1 10 s parcels, including continental data, are plotted (small
black dots) together with the basin-mean values for the PaciÔ¨Åc (red
dot) and Atlantic (blue dot).
built up from the ATom deployments are a metric that should
be used to evaluate our current global chemistry models.
