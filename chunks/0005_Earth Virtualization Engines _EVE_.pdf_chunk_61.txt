advanced weather- and climate-related AI models, a great many
organizations and agencies collect and disseminate other forms of
climate-related data (e.g., from satellites, networks of ground
sensors, gliders, floats, and drones to integrative ecosystem super-
sites) that could greatly enhance this training. EVE will demonstrate
how interoperability of data and software co-proximate to the
computational capacity needed for the requisite machine learning
