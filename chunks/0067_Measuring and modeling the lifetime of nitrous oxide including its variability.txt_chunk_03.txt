a simple radiative transfer model. The result is 116 ± 9 years. The observed monthly‐to‐biennial variations in lifetime and tropical abundance are well matched by four independent chemistry‐transport models driven by reanalysis meteorological fields for the period of observation (2005–2010), but all these models overestimate the lifetime due to lower abundances in the critical loss region near 32 km in the tropics. These models plus a chemistry‐climate model agree on the nitrous oxide feedback
