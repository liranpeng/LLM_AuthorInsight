determine the reactivity of parcels, and thus other 2-D plots
will add new information. We anticipate that ATom measure-
ments will be plotted not only with AIR weightings but also
with reactivities calculated for that air parcel with these mod-
els (Auvray et al., 2007).
The 2-D plots shown here intentionally included all air
parcels over the mid-PaciÔ¨Åc to ensure that a robust distribu-
tion was obtained (see Table 2). If we have only a single lon-
