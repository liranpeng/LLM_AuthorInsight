hindcast was found to be statistically different (p < 0.05)
from the observations, while for EU both distributions are
the same (p < 0.05).
By deﬁning AQX events as the 100 worst days per decade,
we can quantify interannual variability in the number of
events or large episodes per year. If we wish to ascertain
whether individual years have differences in their pollution
episodes in terms of areal extent or duration, then the events
need to be renormalized (i.e., 10 worst days per year). In the
