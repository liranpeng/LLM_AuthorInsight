in the NH QBO composite (except for LMDz5 having twice the amplitude), and thus the disagreement with 
the observations may be caused by the predominantly NH emissions and their annual cycle disrupting the 
QBO composite. These results are part of the Taylor statistics (standard deviation, root-mean-square error, 
and correlation coefficients) for the models versus observations (NOAA) given in supplementary TableÂ S1.
