els accept the same spectral data – cross sections and quan-
tum yields from recent assessments (Atkinson et al., 2004;
Burkholder et al., 2015) – but the implementation (solar
spectrum, Rayleigh scattering, wavelength integration, tem-
perature interpolation) may be different.
Spectrally resolved CAFS measurements of actinic ﬂux
(280–650 nm) are used to calculate in situ J-O1D and J-
NO2. These observed J values are all-sky J values and in-
