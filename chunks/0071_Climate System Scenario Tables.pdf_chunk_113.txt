Notes:
Decadal mean values (2010d = average of 2005–2014) are used for emissions because linear interpolation between decadal means conserves total emissions. Data are taken from RCP database 
(Meinshausen et al., 2011a; http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb) and may be different from yearly snapshots; for 2100 the average (2095–2100) is used. SRES A2 and B1 and IS92a are
