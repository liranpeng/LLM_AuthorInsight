today. Achievement requires (i) successful phase-out of
MPTGs (−0.23 W m−2), (ii) reduction of CH4 forcing by
0.12 W m−2, and (iii) limiting N2O increase to 0.1 W m−2.
A net negative forcing of −0.25 W m−2 for non-CO2 gases
would allow CO2 to be 365 ppm, rather than 350 ppm, while
yielding the same total GHG forcing. Thus, potential reduc-
tion of non-CO2 gases is helpful, but it does not alter the need
for rapid fossil fuel emission reduction.
