chemistry predicts median NOx abundances within 30 % of
observed values while instant dilution over predicts NOx by a
factor of 2. Ozone observations in the same regions are con-
sistent with the plume parameterization but unable to falsify
other model variants.
We compare the chemical and climate impact of shipping
under three different modeling assumptions about plume di-
lution and chemistry:
1. Instant dilution. We neglect sub-grid chemistry and emit
