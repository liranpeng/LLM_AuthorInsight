of the troposphere, but H2O easily spans 3. Several show the
bimodality of many parcels with low O3 with high H2O (ma-
rine boundary layer and above) and a second peak at higher
O3 and dry. For example, C and E look very much alike, but
B has these two peaks more separated, and E has a much
broader spread in upper tropospheric O3 abundances.
