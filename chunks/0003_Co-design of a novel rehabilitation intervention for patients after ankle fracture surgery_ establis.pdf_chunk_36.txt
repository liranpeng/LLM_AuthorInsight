HCP Surveyâ€”Wound management
Full size image
Regarding patients concerns about numbness or tingling around their
wound, HCP consensus was achieved that as long as this did not
become widespread or have a discrete motor loss, patients could be
reassured this was normal and did not need HCP review. However,
HCPs had uncertainty when numbness, tingling or burning sensations
would herald complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and consensus
recommendations were not achieved.
