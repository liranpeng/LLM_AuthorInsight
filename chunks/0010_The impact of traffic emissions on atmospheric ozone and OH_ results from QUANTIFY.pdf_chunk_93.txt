convection for road trafﬁc.
This is also evident from Fig. 7, which shows the tem-
poral evolution of the ozone perturbations for the different
modes of transport. Comparing ship and road induced ozone
perturbations ship emissions have a larger impact on bound-
ary layer ozone than road trafﬁc over the whole year. In the
