into a uniﬁed and coordinated campaign, the six distinct scientiﬁc facets that EUREC4A explored – from North
Brazil Current rings to turbulence-induced clustering of cloud droplets and its inﬂuence on warm-rain formation
– are presented along with an overview of EUREC4A’s outreach activities, environmental impact, and guidelines
for scientiﬁc practice. Track data for all platforms are standardized and accessible at https://doi.org/10.25326/165
