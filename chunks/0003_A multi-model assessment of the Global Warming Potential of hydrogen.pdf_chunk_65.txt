Above this model layer, hydrogen and methane are treated as chemically reactive
tracers in the atmosphere. Additional simulations were also performed with two
models that were run with hydrogen emissions instead of ﬁxed surface
concentration ﬁelds. The methane concentrations were ﬁxed at the surface. GFDL-
emi was perturbed with an extra 200 Tg yr−1 anthropogenic hydrogen emissions
and ran for 50 years. The methane surface concentration was increased based on
