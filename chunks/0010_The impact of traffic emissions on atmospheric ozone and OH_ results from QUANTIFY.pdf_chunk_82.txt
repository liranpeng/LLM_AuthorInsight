ated variations between the individual models in that region
range from 3.5 ppbv (LMDzINCA) to 6 ppbv (p-TOMCAT)
at 250 hPa during July resulting in a standard deviation of
2 ppbv. In the extratropics of the southern hemisphere the
effect of summer convection is not as pronounced due to the
hemispheric differences of the emissions.
Interestingly, the interannual variability of the zonal
mean ozone perturbations of around 0.5 ppbv (â‰ˆ5%) for
