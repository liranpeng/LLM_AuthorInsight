On the smallest O(10−5 m) scale, a sample holographic im-
age from an instrument mounted on the MPCK+ shows the
spatial and size distribution of individual cloud drops. In
situ measurements and airborne remote sensing document
the cloud microphysical structure and its relationship to the
properties of the turbulent wind ﬁeld. On scales of hundreds
of meters to a few kilometers, vertically and horizontally
pointing cloud radars and lidars characterize the geometry
