which is a linearization of the IPCC (2001) forcing for a
background methane mixing ratio of 1740 ppbv and a ni-
trous oxide mixing ratio of 319 ppbv. Second, the radia-
tive forcing due to the methane-induced ozone change (see
Eq. B6 of Berntsen et al. (2005)) is estimated using multi-
model means of both the response of ozone to a methane
change (a 10% increase in methane leads to a 0.64 DU in-
crease in ozone) and an ozone speciÔ¨Åc radiative forcing of
