species)29,30. It is therefore not obvious that a reduced OH level
from hydrogen emissions leads to less sulfate aerosols. INCA and
OsloCTM have a general reduction in sulfate from hydrogen
emission whereas the sign of global sulfate burden varies in the
GFDL model. The changes in aerosols give rise to additional
