cloud layers within a decorrelation length are highly corre-
lated with one another and thus form a MAX group. When
such MAX groups are adjacent they have a mean separation
of one decorrelation length, and we choose a cloud corre-
lation factor of cc = 0.33, similar to 1 e-fold. When there
is a clear-sky gap between a pair of G6 layers, the MAX
groups are separated by more than one decorrelation length;
thus, we reduce the factor cc with successive multiples (i.e.,
