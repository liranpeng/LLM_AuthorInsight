in most ﬁnite-volume discretizations when the analytical so-
lution for ρ is not known.
Finite-volume schemes based on Eq. (1) use tracer mass
ρφ and not mixing ratio φ as the prognostic variable. Hence
ρ must be solved for as well:

It is considered important that the coupling between air
mass and tracer mass is “free-stream preserving” (also re-
ferred to as “consistent tracer transport” in the literature).
