Abstract. To estimate the impact of emissions by road, air-
craft and ship trafÔ¨Åc on ozone and OH in the present-day
atmosphere six different atmospheric chemistry models have
been used. Based on newly developed global emission in-
ventories for road, ship and aircraft emission data sets each
model performed sensitivity simulations reducing the emis-
sions of each transport sector by 5%.
The model results indicate that on global annual average
