to 13.8 DU among the ten participating models, while the
stratospheric column reduction lies between 14.1 DU and
28.6 DU in the models considering stratospheric chemistry.
The resulting radiative forcing is strongly dependent on the
location and altitude of the modeled ozone change and varies
between 0.25 Wm−2 and 0.45 Wm−2 due to ozone change in
the troposphere and −0.123 Wm−2 and +0.066 Wm−2 due to
the stratospheric ozone change.
