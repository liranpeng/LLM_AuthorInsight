accelerate or decelerate, depending on policies that affect
GHG emissions, developing climate feedbacks, and other
factors discussed below.

Holocene temperature has been reconstructed at centennial-
scale resolution from 73 globally distributed proxy temper-
ature records by Marcott et al. (2013). This record shows a
decline of 0.6 ◦C from early Holocene maximum temperature
