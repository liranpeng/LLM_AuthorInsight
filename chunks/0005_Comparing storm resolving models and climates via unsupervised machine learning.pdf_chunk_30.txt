qualitative findings, we will quantify distributional differences across GSRMs next.
Dynamic consistency between highâ€‘resolution climate models
In our analysis, we delve into a comprehensive inter-comparison of various GSRMs on a distributional level, 
aiming to uncover both commonalities and disparities across their entire simulated datasets. The idea behind 
the following approach is to consider model dissimilarities or distances as distribution shifts. In the machine
