Twin Otter targeted cloud ﬁelds, often ﬂying repeated sam-
ples through cloud clusters identiﬁed visibly, but also sam-
pled the sub-cloud layer. The P-3 strategy was more mixed;
some ﬂights targeted speciﬁc conditions, and others were
more statistically oriented (for example, to ﬁll gaps in the
HALO and ATR sampling strategy). The different sampling
strategies are reﬂected in Fig. 3, where the measurements of
HALO are concentrated near 10.2 km and those of the ATR
