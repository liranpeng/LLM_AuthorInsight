also by Abalos et al. (2017) using the e90 tracer. This is ev-
ident for all models, especially in the northern mid-latitudes
(40â—¦N) near the tropopause (Fig. 11). Hence the increase in
CO-tracer mixing ratios arises from a transition between low-
CO stratospheric air for present day and higher CO in tropo-
spheric air in the future.
This also suggests that the impacts of enhanced pole-
ward and upward transport in the northern mid-high latitudes
