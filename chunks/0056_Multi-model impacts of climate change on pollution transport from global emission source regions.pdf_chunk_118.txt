present day and higher CO in tropospheric air in the future, in
accord with Fang et al. (2011). A poleward and upward shift
in zonal-mean winds is consistent across the four models and
noted in previous studies (e.g. Orbe et al., 2015). Resultant
enhanced poleward transport may also minorly contribute to
CO-tracer increases in the future near the tropopause in the
northern mid-latitudes, and changes in eddy mixing may also
have an impact. However, all these processes may be inter-
