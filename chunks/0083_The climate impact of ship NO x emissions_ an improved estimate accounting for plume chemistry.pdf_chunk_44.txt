lution assumption OPE is 12.5. Thus, the parametric plume
chemistry has the intended effect of suppressing O3 produc-
tion by 30 %, relative to instant dilution. The ﬁxed OPE sce-
nario assumes OPE to be 10 in the plume, but subsequently
global O3 production is suppressed in grid-resolved chem-
istry since no NOx is released so the total OPE is 8.0.
O3 enhancements generated by ship NOx concentrate over
the major emission regions in the Atlantic and Paciﬁc oceans
