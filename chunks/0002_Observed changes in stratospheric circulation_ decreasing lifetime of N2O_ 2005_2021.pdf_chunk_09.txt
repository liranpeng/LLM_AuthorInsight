M. J. Prather et al.: Observed changes in stratospheric circulation
proﬁles of N2O, O3, and temperature, we calculate the to-
tal loss of N2O in the column, needing only the solar spec-
trum and absorption cross sections, as in Prather et al. (2015,
hence P2015). We ﬁnd that the stratospheric N2O loss rate
is increasing more quickly than the observed trend in surface
