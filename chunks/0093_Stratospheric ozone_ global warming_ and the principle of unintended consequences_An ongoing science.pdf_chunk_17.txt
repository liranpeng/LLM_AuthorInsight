Rosenfield and Douglass, 1998). Rosenfield and Douglass
(1998) and Fleming et al. (2011) have examined the role of
N2O in a climate future that is projected to have higher strato-
spheric O3 levels than during pre-CFC conditions, and where the
N2O–NOy–O3 connection is damped because of CO2 cooling of
the stratosphere. Fleming et al. (2011, p. 8515) point out that
CO2 affects stratospheric O3 by: “1) cooling the stratosphere
which increases O3 via reduction in the O3 chemical loss rates,
