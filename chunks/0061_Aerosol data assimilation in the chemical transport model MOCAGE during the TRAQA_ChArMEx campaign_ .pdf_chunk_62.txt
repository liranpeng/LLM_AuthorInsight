1993). Modelled and observed AODs are then on the same 2-
D grid, and the maximal number of observations per 1 h slot
over the whole domain is reduced in this way from ≈80 000
to ≈15 000. MODIS data from the Terra and Aqua platforms
are separated in time, except at high latitudes (not used here),
and all AODs are binned in the MEDI02 grid at 5 min inter-
vals.
