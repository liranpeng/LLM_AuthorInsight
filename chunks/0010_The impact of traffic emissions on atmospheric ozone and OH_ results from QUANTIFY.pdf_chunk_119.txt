about 5·105 molecules/cm3 is of similar magnitude as the an-
nual mean concentration in temperate and high latitudes, and
is therefore highly signiﬁcant on a global scale. Also in win-
ter the boundary layer OH perturbation is still of the order of
10%. As can be seen from Fig. 9 ship emissions are dominat-
ing the annual zonal mean OH perturbation in the boundary
layer throughout the year.
The effect of road emissions on the OH distribution shows
