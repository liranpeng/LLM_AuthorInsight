using the UKCA-StratTrop chemistry conﬁguration. The conﬁguration was run
with the Chemistry AeroClim option which is a full chemistry version of the model
run with aerosol climatologies. The water vapor in the model was held ﬁxed with
respect to the chemistry such that any change in the water vapor mass mixing ratio
due to chemistry was not applied to the tracer. This version was modiﬁed to run
with the chemical tracers in UKCA uncoupled from the radiation such that the
