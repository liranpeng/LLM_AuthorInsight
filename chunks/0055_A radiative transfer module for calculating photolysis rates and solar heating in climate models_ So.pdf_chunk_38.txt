Warren, 1984). Liquid-water clouds use Deirmendjian’s C.1
gamma distribution of drop sizes (α = 6; see Deirmendjian,
1969) and the Mie code from Hansen and Travis (1974) for
a range of effective radii: re = 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 µm; see
also Hess et al. (1998). Optical properties (SSA, Q, A0:7, g)
are calculated for bins S12–S27 for these effective radii and
then individual cloud properties at each bin are interpolated
piecewise linearly in re.
