estimates: 12.2–23.5) teragrams of nitrogen per year (bottom-up) and 16.9 (15.9–17.7) 
teragrams of nitrogen per year (top-down) between 2007 and 2016. Global human-induced 
emissions, which are dominated by nitrogen additions to croplands, increased by 30% 
over the past four decades to 7.3 (4.2–11.4) teragrams of nitrogen per year. This 
increase was mainly responsible for the growth in the atmospheric burden. Our
