(termed Rn). Connecting the new edge points by great circle
arcs yields n2 spherical triangles within the original triangle.
This step is followed by k bisection steps (termed Bk), where
each triangle is consecutively subdivided into four smaller
triangles. This results in a so-called RnBk grid. The inter-
mediate grids and the ﬁnal grid are further optimized using
spring dynamics (Tomita et al., 2001), with the spring coef-
ﬁcient set to β = 0.9. For a given resolution RnBk, the total
