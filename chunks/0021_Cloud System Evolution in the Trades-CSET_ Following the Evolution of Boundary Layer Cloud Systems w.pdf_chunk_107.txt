systems. The classic broken fair-weather cumulus fields were not generally sampled on the 
outbound flights, but were more prevalent on the beginning of the inbound flights 
originating from Hawaii.
b. Process Studies
The CSET observations also provide an observational basis for underlying processes 
involved in the evolution of the boundary layer clouds. This included illumination of the role 
of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions and the role of mesoscale cloud systems in the
