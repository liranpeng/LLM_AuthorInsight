in L2 is reduced and is calculated from the requirement that
the sum of cloudy fractions in L1 is still f L1.
wL1(#3) = f L1(1 −gL1f L2)/(1 −f L2)
= 0.15 × (1 −3 × 0.20)/0.80 = 7.5%

By complement, the weighting of clear sky in layer L1 under
clear sky in layer L2 is
wL1(#4) = 1 −wL1(#3) = 1 −0.075 = 92.5%.

Note that if cc = 0, or f L2 = 1, or f L1 = 1, then gL1 = 1 and
correlated overlap (COR) defaults to RAN. The two addi-
tional limits on gL1 in Eq. (10) are required to keep wL1(#2)
