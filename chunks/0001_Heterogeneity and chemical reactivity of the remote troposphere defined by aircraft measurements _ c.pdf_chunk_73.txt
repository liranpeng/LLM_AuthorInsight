tocol avoids much of the fast thermal release of NOx in the
lower atmosphere during the ﬁrst 24 h of the RDS calculation
but does not affect the release of NOx from photolysis or OH
reactions in the upper troposphere where thermal decompo-
sition is inconsequential. It is possible that some of the high
concentrations of HNO4 and PAN in the lower troposphere
are real and that we are missing this large source of NOx
with the RDS* protocol, but we ﬁnd no obvious sources of
