in the atmosphere are shown in (c). There is a very good agree-
ment between the models on the chemistry of hydrogen, despite
the models being quite different. One exception is WACCM,
which has lower formaldehyde levels in the troposphere com-
pared to the other models. In our model set-up for prescribed
surface concentrations, the amount of hydrogen in the atmo-
sphere (a) is determined by the surface concentrations, the che-
mical production, and loss, but does not get affected by the soil
