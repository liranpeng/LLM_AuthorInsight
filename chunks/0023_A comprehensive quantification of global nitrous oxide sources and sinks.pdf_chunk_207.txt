Extended Data Fig. 6 | Global N2O emissions from natural soils, inland and 
coastal waters and due to change in climate, atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen 
deposition. a, Changes in global soil N2O fluxes due to changing CO2 and 
climate. b, Global natural soil N2O emissions without consideration of land use 
change (for example, deforestation) and without consideration of indirect 
anthropogenic effects via global change (that is, climate, increased CO2 and
