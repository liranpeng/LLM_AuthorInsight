pletion during the last three decades has been connected with
increasing chlorine and bromine levels resulting from the use
of CFCs, HCFCs, and halons. Climate change since prein-
dustrial times has in part been caused by anthropogenic emis-
sions of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), CH4,
nitrous oxide (N2O), and CFCs, and by changes in ozone.
