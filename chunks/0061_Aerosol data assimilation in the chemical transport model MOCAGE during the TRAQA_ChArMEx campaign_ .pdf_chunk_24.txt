vertical resolution varies with altitude, with a resolution of
40 m in the planetary boundary layer, about 400 m in the free
troposphere and about 700–800 m in the upper troposphere
and lower stratosphere. The version of the model used in this
study is described in Siˇc et al. (2015), and has been evaluated
with a range of different remote-sensed and in situ measure-
ments for cases and regions relevant to this study.
The model can include nested domains over smaller re-
