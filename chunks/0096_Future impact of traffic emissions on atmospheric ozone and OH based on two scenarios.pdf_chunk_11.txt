sions (Fuglestvedt et al., 2008), and one study predicts that
in 2030 the trafﬁc sector will constitute 29 % of the total an-
thropogenic ozone RF (Unger et al., 2008). Ozone precursor
emissions also alter the levels of OH, normally leading to a
reduction of methane (CH4) lifetime and thereby a cooling
of the atmosphere.
This paper follows a series of recent studies that have
quantiﬁed impacts of transport emissions on atmospheric
chemistry and climate (Fuglestvedt et al., 2008; Cariolle et
