increased lightning production of NOx.
Comparison with Fig. 2 gives an estimate of the impor-
tance of climate change compared to chemical change. How-
ever, the spatial distribution of the climate change signal of
is determined by a complex combination of changes in trans-
port, temperature, and microphysical processes, and, given
the small temperature signal in particular, it is difÔ¨Åcult to
clearly identify the signal above interannual variations.
