the CEST Field Catalog.
5. Summary
CSET made substantial advancement in our characterization of the evolution of cloud 
systems along the southeast extent of the Pacific anticyclone further CET and demonstrated 
the utility of a Lagrangian sampling strategy. The observations provide a unique opportunity 
to study of the processes involved in the cloud system evolution in the Pacific trades and to 
characterize that evolution in a way that can be used to evaluate model simulations of the
