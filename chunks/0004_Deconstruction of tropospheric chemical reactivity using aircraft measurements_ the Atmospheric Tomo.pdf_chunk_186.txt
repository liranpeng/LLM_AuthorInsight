the O3 lifetime because the steady-state concentration is pro-
portional to it: [O3]steady-state = P constantT A. This approxima-
tion is valid only if
dln[L-O3]
dln[O3]
≡1 and dln[P-O3]
dln[O3]
≡0,

but instead, from Table 4, for ATom-1 Atlantic we have
dln[L-O3]
dln[O3]
≡1.01 and dln[P-O3]
dln[O3]
≡−0.41.

So, L-O3 is very close to linear in [O3], but P-O3 decreases as
[O3] increases, and thus the net P minus L (Eq. 3) decreases
