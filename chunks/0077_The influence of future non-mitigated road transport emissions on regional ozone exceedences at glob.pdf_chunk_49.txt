considering the large area over which they are distributed, meaning
that there are rarely exceedences at continental scale. Other regions
such as Asia show a substantial increase in the area of exceedence
related to increasing anthropogenic NTS emissions. For our analysis
we investigate the future exceedences which occur in both devel-
oped and developing regions. Therefore, we choose two regions
which have an improvement in air-quality and two regions which
