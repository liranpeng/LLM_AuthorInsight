lution, time step, and accuracy diagnostics. In LSPT2012 it
was assumed that model developers have already tested their
schemes under simpler ﬂow conditions such as solid-body
ﬂows. Similarly, LSPT2012 did not ask modelers to report on
more specialized test cases that may be useful to study cer-
tain, perhaps more specialized, aspects of accuracy. For ex-
ample, by running well-known deformational test cases out
further in time (Pudykiewicz, 2011), one can study the down-
