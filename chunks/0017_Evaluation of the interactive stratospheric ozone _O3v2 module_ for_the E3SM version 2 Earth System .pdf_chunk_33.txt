ﬁle data (ii) are provided in the MLS level 3 gridded data
set ML3MBO3 V004 (Schwartz et al., 2020). We linearly
interpolate the model results to the coarser observational
grids when calculating model–observation differences. The
daily TCO data (iii) are collected by the Total Ozone Map-
ping Spectrometer (TOMS) on the NASA/NOAA Nimbus-
7 satellite (McPeters et al., 1996), the OMI instrument on
the Aura satellite, and the Ozone Mapper and Proﬁler Suite
