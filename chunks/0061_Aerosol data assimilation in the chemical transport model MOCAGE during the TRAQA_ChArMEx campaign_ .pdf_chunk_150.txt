independent datasets, conﬁrms the signiﬁcant positive effect
of the AOD assimilation to the model. For example, the com-
parison with AERONET data shows that the assimilation de-
creased the bias in AOD (from 0.050 to 0.006) and increased
the correlation (from 0.74 to 0.88).
The TRAQA campaign provided independent 3-D data on
aerosol concentration. The assimilation sometimes improved
the modelled ﬁelds and sometimes had little effect. The best
