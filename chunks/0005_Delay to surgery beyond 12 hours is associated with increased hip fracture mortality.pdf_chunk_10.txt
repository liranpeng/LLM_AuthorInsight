were then divided into time categories where time from 
admission to surgery was under 12 h, 12–24 h, 24–72 h 
and over 72 h. Separate analysis for time of fall to sur-
gery was performed on the subgroup where time of injury 
was also available. All patients were followed up with 
telephone consultation at 12 months and survival was 
confirmed with either the patient or next of kin. Where 
patients were not reachable, mortality was confirmed via 
hospital databases or recorded as missing data.
