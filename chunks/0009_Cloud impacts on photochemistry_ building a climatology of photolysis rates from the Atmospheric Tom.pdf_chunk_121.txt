cept for J-O1D in the North Paciﬁc for which there is in-
explicably a core group of eight models within ±10 %. The
observed CAFS cloudy proﬁles show a distinctly different
proﬁle in the North Paciﬁc vs. the tropical Paciﬁc for both J-
O1D and J-NO2 (Fig. 1) and especially in the CAFS / TUV
derived J-cloudy to J-clear ratios (Fig. 3). Many models fol-
low this typical proﬁle in the tropical Paciﬁc (100–900 hPa;
Fig. 3), but some (NCAR, UCI, UCIb) show large shifts to
