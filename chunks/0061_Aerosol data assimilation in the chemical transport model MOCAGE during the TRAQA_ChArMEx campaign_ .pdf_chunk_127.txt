tion increases aerosol mixing ratios in lower layers, and de-
creases them in higher layers. We see a similar effect around
1 July in the northern part of the basin, where the proﬁle
shape changes due to the altitude varying wind direction and
velocity and thus the associated pronounced air mass mixing.
