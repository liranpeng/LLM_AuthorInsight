As in AR6, we use the effective radiative forcing (ERF) instead of RF.
The AGWP100 of CO2 is 0.0895 10−12 W m−2 kg−1 yr from IPCC AR6
Table 7.SM.648. The ERF of hydrogen is the sum of the effective radiative forcing
contributions by methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapor.
We rewrite the AGWP from equation (2) to account for results for a run with a
pulse emission of mass mem
i
given in units of kg yr−1.
