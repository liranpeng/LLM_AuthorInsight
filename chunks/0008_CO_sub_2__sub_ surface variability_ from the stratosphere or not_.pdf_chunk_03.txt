observed IAV and is not an important source. Diagnosing the amplitude of the CO2 annual cycle and its in-
crease from 1985 to 2021 through the annual variance gives rates similar to traditional methods in the Northern
Hemisphere (BRW, MLO) but can identify the emergence of small trends (0.08 ppm per decade) in the Southern
Hemisphere (SMO, CGO).

Introduction
The surface abundance of CO2, also called the Keeling curve
(Fig. 1a), is used as the prime example of the human-driven
