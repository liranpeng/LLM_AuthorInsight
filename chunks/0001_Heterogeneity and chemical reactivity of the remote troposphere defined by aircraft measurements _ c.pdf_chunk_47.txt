sphere than found in most models’ climatologies associated
with higher NOx levels than in the models. Section 5 con-
cludes that the ATom PDs based on 10s air parcels do provide
a valid chemistry metric for global models with 1◦resolution.
It also presents some examples where ATom measurements
and modeling can test the chemical relationships and may ad-
dress the cause of differences in the O3 and CH4 budgets cur-
rently seen across the models. With this paper we release the
