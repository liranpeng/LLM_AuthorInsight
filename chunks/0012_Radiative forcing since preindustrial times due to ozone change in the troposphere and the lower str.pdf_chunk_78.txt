Simpliﬁed calculations were used
in STOCHEM HadGEM1 and CHASER (based on the
method of Randel and Wu, 1999) and FRSCG (linearized
ozone based on McLinden et al., 2000).
UM CAM,
STOCHEM HadAM3, and LMDzINCA did not calculate
stratospheric change explicitly.
The scenarios deﬁned for this study are listed in Table 3.
The year 2000 simulation is labeled “scenario 2”. A variety
of scenarios was deﬁned for 1850 in order to distinguish be-
tween contributions from changes in ozone precursors, ozone
