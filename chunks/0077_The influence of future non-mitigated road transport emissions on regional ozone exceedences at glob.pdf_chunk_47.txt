which represents the maximal effect throughout the year.
When examining the seasonal distribution of the ER for 2025
and 2050 simulated using the A1B emission estimates (not shown),
the strong mitigation practices associated with NTS emissions for
both Europe and the USA means that ER values typically reach
between 0.7 and 1.1 (i.e.) somewhat lower than the maximal values
