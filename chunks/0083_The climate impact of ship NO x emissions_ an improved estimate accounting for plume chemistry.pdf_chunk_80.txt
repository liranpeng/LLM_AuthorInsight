the non-linear aspects of O3 chemistry are generated almost
entirely during NOx loss and O3 production, and that adding
O3 alone does not signiﬁcantly change the O3 lifetime.
Model grid resolution is known to inﬂuence climatically
important chemical ﬂuxes, such as O3 production (Wild and
Prather, 2006), so we test whether resolution affects RF from
ship NOx. Doubling the GEOS-Chem grid size to 4◦× 5◦re-
duces the CH4 lifetime and O3 burden compared to 2◦× 2.5◦
