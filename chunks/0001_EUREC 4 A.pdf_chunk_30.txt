how they will respond to warming, and their link to other components of the earth system, such as upper-ocean
processes or the life cycle of particulate matter. This characterization was made possible by thousands (2500) of
sondes distributed to measure circulations on meso- (200 km) and larger (500 km) scales, roughly 400 h of ï¬‚ight
time by four heavily instrumented research aircraft; four global-class research vessels; an advanced ground-
