GHG simulation (as historical, but only the WMGHG forc-
ings evolve).
The transient ERFs for each species or group of species
will be diagnosed by subtracting the top of atmosphere and
surface radiative ï¬‚uxes in the perturbed runs from those in
histSST. For models without interactive chemistry, histSST-
piNTCF and histSST-piAer are identical, and the same ozone
climatology as histSST should be used.
