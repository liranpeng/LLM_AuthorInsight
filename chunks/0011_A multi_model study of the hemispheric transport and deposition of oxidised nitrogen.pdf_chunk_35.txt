pairs the majority (10 or more) of the models gave a similar
result, but there were instances where the sensitivities were
different. This latter result suggests that there are some non-
linear chemical effects on the formation and deposition of
NOy, but the spread of results amongst the models is too
large to allow a more definitive statement to be made.
[16] Deposition of NOy species occurs via both wet and
dry processes, and the former is generally a more efficient
