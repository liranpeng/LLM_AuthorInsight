proves aerosol representation in the model. For example, the
comparison of the direct and the assimilated model run with
AERONET data shows that the assimilation increased the
correlation (from 0.74 to 0.88), and reduced the bias (from
0.050 to 0.006) and the root mean square error in the AOD
(from 0.12 to 0.07). When compared to the 3-D concentra-
tion data obtained by the in situ aircraft and balloon mea-
surements, the assimilation consistently improves the model
