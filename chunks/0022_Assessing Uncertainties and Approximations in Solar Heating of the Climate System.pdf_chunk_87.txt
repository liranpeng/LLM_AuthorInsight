the asymmetry factor, see Table 2), and likewise reduce the scattering optical depth. The reduction in cloud 
optical depth applies only to the scattering optical depth τsca, while the absorbing τabs is unchanged. These 
δ-scaling methods are chosen to avoid the unphysical negative phase functions that result from truncation 
of the Legendre series. The 8-stream in Solar-J does not use delta-M scaling because early tests showed that
