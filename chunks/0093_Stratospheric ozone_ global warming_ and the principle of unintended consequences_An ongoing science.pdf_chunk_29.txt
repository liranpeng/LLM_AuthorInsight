assumes large CO2 reductions without HFC emission decreases.
Given that both are listed in the Kyoto Protocol, and given the
pain and cost of CO2 mitigation, this scenario seems unlikely.
HFC emission reductions need to be part of any climate package,
but HFC reductions independent of what happens to CO2 emis-
sions will be insufficient to address global warming.
Brominated compounds are unlikely to be as important as stated
in the critical review. The critical review overgeneralizes the impact
