anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, which increase tropospheric O3 (warming) but
also increase aerosols and decrease CH4 (both cooling). Anthropogenic emissions of carbon
monoxide (CO) and non-CH4 volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) warm by increasing both
O3 and CH4. Radiative impacts from secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are poorly understood.
Black carbon emission controls, by reducing the absorption of sunlight in the atmosphere and on
