imal initial displacement of fracture, only presenting when 
their condition deteriorates. Our data suggest patients who 
are otherwise well should be prioritised by time of admis-
sion and the time of fall should not routinely affect decision 
making. It is also possible that patients present late with 
long lies due to not being found following a fall and then 
deteriorate as a result. These would likely have been delayed 
for medical reasons and therefore excluded from this study
