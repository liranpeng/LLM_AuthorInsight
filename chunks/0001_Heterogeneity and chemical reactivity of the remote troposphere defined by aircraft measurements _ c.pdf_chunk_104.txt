distributed as HOx is. Highly reactive (hot) P-O3 parcels
(> 4 ppb d−1) occur only in the upper troposphere (8–12 km)
and only in the sub-tropics. ATom-1 RF1 (29 July 2016)
occurred during the North American Monsoon when there
was easterly ﬂow off Mexico; thus the high reactivity of
this large air mass indicates that continental deep convection
with lightning NOx is a source of high reactivity for both O3
and CH4.
In the Atlantic (Fig. 2c, f, i), we also see similar air masses
