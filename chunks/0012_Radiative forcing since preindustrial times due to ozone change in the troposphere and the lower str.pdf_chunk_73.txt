ception is ULAQ, which used 9.3 pptv for CH3Br in the year
2000 simulation.
Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) to be used in the CCMs
were taken from prescribed data. ULAQ used a 1960–1970
SST average from Hadley Centre data for the 1850 simula-
tion subtracting 0.3 K everywhere. For the year 2000 climate,
a 1960–2020 SST average from Hadley Center data was
used. The DLR E39C model applied 10-year averages from
the MPI-Hamburg coupled ocean-atmosphere general circu-
