increase its impact for all RF terms in the future, but the in-
crease for the cooling terms (CH4 and CH4-induced O3) will
dominate to yield a stronger net negative RF in the future,
namely between −40 ± 9.5 (A1B) and −31 ± 4.8 mW m−2
(B1) in the middle of this century. Comparison with previous
literature reveals large spread in the magnitude of present-
day and future ship-induced impact on O3 RF, and suggests
that this issue should be given increased attention, especially
