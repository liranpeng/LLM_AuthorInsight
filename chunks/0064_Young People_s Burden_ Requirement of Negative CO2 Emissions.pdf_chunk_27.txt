balance, measured in W m−2. For example, Earth absorbs about
240 W m−2 of solar energy, so if the Sun’s brightness increases 1 %
it is a forcing of +2.4 W m−2.
3Climate sensitivity is the response of global average surface
temperature to a standard forcing, with the standard forcing com-
monly taken to be doubled atmospheric CO2, which is a forcing of
about 4 W m−2 (Hansen et al., 2005).
4IPCC (2013) ﬁnds that 2 × CO2 equilibrium sensitivity is likely
