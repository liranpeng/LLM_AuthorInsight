Results presented in this paper show that the AOD data
assimilation is an efﬁcient technique to improve modelled
aerosol ﬁelds. Assimilated ﬁelds have better statistical per-
formances than the direct model run in comparison with the
assimilated observations, and with independent AOD obser-
vations and in situ measurements. The uncertainties in the
