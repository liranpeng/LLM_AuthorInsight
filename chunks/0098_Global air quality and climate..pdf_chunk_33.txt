levels (e.g., ref. 35), thereby exerting a positive climate forcing.
This positive forcing may be oﬀset by an accompanying
negative forcing due to lower CH4 abundances, because
increasing NOx enhances tropospheric OH and reaction with
OH is the primary CH4 loss pathway in the atmosphere.36 The
net RF of these opposing inﬂuences on the climate system
