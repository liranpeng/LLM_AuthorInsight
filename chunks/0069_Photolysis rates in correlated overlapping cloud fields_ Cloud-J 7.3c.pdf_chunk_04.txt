is altered by scattering and absorption processes within the
atmosphere. Clouds, aerosols, and gases control these pro-
cesses, but ambiguity in the representation of clouds in at-
mospheric models is currently the largest source of uncer-
tainty in photolysis rates. This paper presents a new, prag-
matic approach for representing the overlap of clouds derived
from observations and cloud models, and then provides sev-
eral practical approximations with marginal computational
