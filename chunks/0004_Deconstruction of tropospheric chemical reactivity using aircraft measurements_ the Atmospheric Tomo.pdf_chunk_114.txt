shows the deviations from linearity (SXY ) for each of the
15 XY pair combinations, listing the Paciﬁc basin in the
upper triangular part of the matrix and the Atlantic basin
in the lower triangular part. The diagonals simply give the
mean ﬁrst-order SX values for the Paciﬁc plus the Atlantic.
These off-diagonal SXY terms are clearly second order in
importance for the chemistry: e.g., the importance of the
SXY term in d2ln(L-CO)/dln(O3) dln(Q) for the Paciﬁc is
