straightforward δ-M scaling of ice clouds, here and in LBYY, does not seem to cause much error, but we can-
not easily judge the other more parameterized polynomial fits for 2-stream use (Fu, 1996; Zhao et al., 2018).
In terms of atmospheric heating by clouds, LBYY's parametric study (their Figure 3) shows reduced values 
over most ranges of optical depth and sun angle, and this error is clearly associated with the number of
