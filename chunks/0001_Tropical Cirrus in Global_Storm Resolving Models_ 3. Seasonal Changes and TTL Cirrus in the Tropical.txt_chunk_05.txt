between the two phases, yet each model exhibits unique cloud populations that are persistent across seasons. GSRMs even simulate the notoriously difficult‐to‐observe tropical tropopause layer (TTL) cirrus, providing a novel perspective on TTL cirrus even though the models have different cloud characteristics over the short 40‐days simulation.
