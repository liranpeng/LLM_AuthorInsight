is used (e.g., Nair et al., 2005). For details on the SLFV

Wave-propagation algorithm
Related to the “swept area” approaches described above, in
the sense that this algorithm has some conceptual similar-
ities, is the wave-propagation algorithm of LeVeque (2002).
The speciﬁc version of this algorithm is referred to as CLAW
as it is implemented in the general Clawpack package (LeV-
eque, 2006). The wave-propagation algorithm can be viewed
