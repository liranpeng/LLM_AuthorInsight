emissions by 1 Tg(N) yr−1 are smaller than that given in the
past literature: +3.4 ± 0.85 mW m−2 (1σ conﬁdence inter-
val) from the short-lived ozone increase, −5.7±1.3 mW m−2
from the CH4 decrease, and −1.7 ± 0.7 mW m−2 from the
long-lived O3 decrease that accompanies the CH4 change.
The resulting net RF is −4.0 ± 2.0 mW m−2 for emissions
of 1 Tg(N) yr−1. Due to non-linearity in O3 production as
a function of background NOx, RF from large changes in
