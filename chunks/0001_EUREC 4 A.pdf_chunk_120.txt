and the macrophysical properties of clouds. On yet larger
O(105 m) scales, the spatial organization and clustering of
clouds and precipitation features are captured by satellite, by
high-resolution radiometry from high-altitude aircraft, and
by the C-band scanning radar, POLDIRAD (Schroth et al.,
1988).
An example of how the measurements upwind and down-
wind of the EUREC4A-Circle helped constrain its aerosol en-
vironment is shown in Fig. 12. Two periods with larger CCN
