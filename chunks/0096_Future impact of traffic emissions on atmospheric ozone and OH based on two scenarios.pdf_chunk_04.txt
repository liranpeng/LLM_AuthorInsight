semble of six different atmospheric chemistry models, each
simulating the atmospheric chemical composition in a possi-
ble high emission scenario (A1B), and with emissions from
each transport sector reduced by 5 % to estimate sensitivities.
Our results are compared with optimistic future emission sce-
narios (B1 and B1 ACARE), presented in a companion paper,
and with the recent past (year 2000). Present-day activity in-
dicates that anthropogenic emissions so far evolve closer to
