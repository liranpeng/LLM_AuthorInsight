equations for observed GHG amounts and scenarios, so er-
rors in the radiation calculations do not alter the comparison.
Equations for GHG forcings are from Table 1 of Hansen et
al. (2000) with the CH4 forcing using an efﬁcacy factor 1.4 to
include effects of CH4 on tropospheric O3 and stratospheric
H2O (Hansen et al., 2005).

then falling to a level 10–25 % below IPCC SRES (2000)
