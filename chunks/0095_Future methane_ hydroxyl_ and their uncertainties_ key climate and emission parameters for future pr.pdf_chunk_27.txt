GEOS-Chem
GEOS-Chem is a tropospheric CTM, driven by assimilated
meteorological data from the NASA Goddard Earth Observ-
ing System (GEOS-5) or MERRA reanalysis (Rienecker et
al., 2008, 2011). Both GEOS-5 and MERRA are produced
from closely related assimilation systems, using the same
spatial resolution of 0.5◦× 0.66◦and 72 vertical layers. We
use GEOS-Chem version 9-01-02 here. Most results, includ-
ing all sensitivity simulations, are based on GEOS-5 meteo-
