at the edge the polar vortex and is accompanied by a large upward ﬂux inside the polar vortex, a known
erroneous bias of the residual circulation in this region where the zonal mean ﬂow is strong (see discussion
in Miyazaki and Iwasaki [2008]). The TC-e90 ﬂux peaks during winter and spring in both hemispheres, but
the NH has an extended summer peak due to convective enhancement of STE O3 ﬂux over the continents
