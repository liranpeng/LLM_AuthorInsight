Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) and which allow
for a 3-D characterisation of cloud fraction, cloud liquid wa-
ter path and cloud as well as ice number concentrations. The
ﬁxed SST approach can be further applied with additional
radiation calls to diagnose the various aerosol–cloud effects
(Ghan et al., 2012). Most models will provide all-sky and
clear-sky radiative ﬂuxes, by computing ﬂuxes with a re-
peated double call to the radiation routine neglecting cloud
