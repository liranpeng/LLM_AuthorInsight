N2O + hv →N2 + O
(R1)
N2O + O(1D) →N2 + O2
(R2)
N2O + O(1D) →NO + NO
(R3)
The O(1D) is calculated from the O3–T proﬁles assuming
production equals loss.
O3 + hv →O(1D) + O2
(R4)
O(1D) + N2 →O(3P) + N2
(R5)
O(1D) + O2 →O(3P) + O2
(R6)
The radiative transfer calculation is the same as in Prather et
al. (2015) and includes the solar declination for the middle of
each month, the Sun–Earth distance, but not the solar cycle
(a mean solar ﬂux is used).
